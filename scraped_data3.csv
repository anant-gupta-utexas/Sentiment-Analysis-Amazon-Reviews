Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Excellent price, actually waterproof, lightweight, functional and comfy.",5,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   Great coat. Lightweight and actually waterproof. Water lands on it, but the coat does not get wet. Zero soak. I love it. It has taken me years to find a waterproof coat in my price range. I’m a preschool teacher, so I can’t affoard gortex. But this was like $20? And I can take it to work every day, and if the weather decides to rain and I have to take the kids outside, it really makes it so much more bearable.  Love it."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Actually pretty good.,5,"I ordered an XL thinking that it would run small, but it’s actually a little roomy on me. The waterproofing seems very well done. Ample pocket space for whatever dumb things I feel like carrying.Addendum: I wore it fishing, wading in the rain, and I stayed plenty dry and warm with this on."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,NOT WATERPROOF,1,"I wanted to like this jacket, I'm tall and have long arms, usually things are too short for me in the sleeves but this fit great, little short on the tail end for a raincoat but it was acceptable.Love the color, it's actually neon or fluorescent green as opposed to yellow which is typically mislabeled but this is actually green.It is not however, waterproof.  I thought the weak link was going to be in the way the hood zips off the jacket, which is in fact one area of leakage I believe, however, if you look at the photos you'll see it also seems to leak where the seams are around the shoulder blades as well.I was out in pouring rain for about 8-10 minutes, it's less than two months old, I'm sad it doesn't work, looks really cool  but not waterproof I'm afraid."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Good Jacket to wear over warm clothes,5,"A great rain coat for the price. Beware, however... As the description states this is a ""shell"" type of jacket. The lining inside this jacket is not intended for warmth but to keep the rain from soaking through. And let me tell you...it DOES a great job of doing that! I bought this in an XL to wear over a sweatshirt, and it does that perfectly!"
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Poor cuff closure design.,3,I'm 5'9 165lbs and I ordered a medium. It fits me well. I wear it while I power wash on cooler days and have stayed dry so far after a few uses. What drives me crazy is the sleeve closure design. I have an average or greater than average sized wrist and the placement of the Velcro is very poorly designed. See attached photo. I'm going to ask my wife if she can fix the issue so I don't have to go through the troubles of returning the jacket. If they could just either add more Velcro or move the current piece I would've given 5 stars for the price I  paid. The jacket allows room for layering and plenty of room in the sleeves.
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Nice lightweight jacket,5,"Seems like a decent lightweight jacket. Wouldn't keep you warm but light enough that you could bundle layers of clothing underneath if needed. My son liked it, not sure how waterproof it really is.I wanted to replicate a typical Florida rain storm so I pushed my son in the pool wearing it and his clothes were soaked when he climbed out"
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Twice As Good,5,"I purchased one of these in dark grey, liked it so much that I bought another one, this time the black camo.While the sleeves are ridiculously long, better that than too short, and they can be tightened to preference with the velcro strips at each wrist.I usually wear a Large, but ordered the Medium and am glad I did.  It's a little tight across the midsection (my diet?) but other than that the Large would have been too bulky and even longer in the sleeves.I really like the quality of construction and the attention to the little things that make this jacket work for me.One of those things are the deep, zippered, side pockets.  When I insert my man-sized hands into them, they easily cover well above my wrists.  The interior breast pocket is also zippered, and large enough for the few things (like masks) that I use them for.The entire interior of the jacket is lined and breaths very nicely.  The jacket is light, the hood removes easily, and it can be zippered all the way up under the chin, or loosely closed with several well-placed velcro strips down the front of the jacket.I can attest to the jacket being wind-resistant, but haven't really given it a downpour to test it's waterproofing or lack thereof.  I wanted something light, comfortable, durable, and warm with the right layering and this jacket hit all of those marks.It's also a little longer overall, which is good thing for backside coverage.If these are really waterproof, I will be totally pleased.  No matter what, I'm satisfied."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great Rain Jacket (5 Stars) - Weird Wrist Strap (-1 Star),4,"X-Large clothing can be tight or loose on me, so I chose to get the X-Large size jacket. It has a little more room than normal and the sleeves are a little on the long side (I have short arms). So, true to size is correct.The only issue that I have found, so far, is the weird wrist strap. The weird velcro strip and the anchor strip location is not good for a normal size wrist. If your wrists are as wide as your bicep, then there is no problem. Somebody else also mentioned the weird wrist straps, so it seems to be a production thing. Fix that weird design and it gets 5 stars."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Just What the Doctor Ordered 5,5,This was perfect to block the wind as I rode downhill along side of a mountain.
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Very Good Jacket for Coaches on Rainy and Windy Days,5,"This jacket blocks rain and/or wind very well. Half the battle of staying warm is to have the wind blocked and to not get drenched by rain. This jacket does very well in allowing you to stay warm.There are a number of zippered pockets that are helpful if you like to keep certain items grouped together, or keep certain items separated.The hood is a nice feature - it is not some kind of magical hood, but it is waterproof.  Don't go thinking that the hood eliminates water or wind problems for the head. The hood is not adjustable, and does not have any kind of adjustment means to keep it snug around your head.  So if you are required to be facing into the wind because you are watching a game, the hood will come right off your head like a kite.The jacket does not breathe. Heat or water vapor does not magically vent through wonderful microscopic holes. You can get hot in the jacket if you wear it for too long. So you will need to periodically use a low tech solution - unzip the jacket and flap it a few times to release the heat, and then rezip the jacket. Yes, you did pay $35 for the jacket, and no, you did not pay an extra $200 for the magic fabric that invisibly vents heat and water vapor.If you can't adjust the wrist cuff diameter, the cuff flaps around and lets the cold air shoot up the inside of the jacket, from the wrist all the way up the sleeve. So most people will end up sticking their hands in the jacket pockets, but not realize that this is because their cuff is scooping cold wet air up the arm, and this is because their wrist cuffs are not adjustable. LOL! Anyway, there is an absolutely cheap a** adjustment strap at wrist cuff so you can tighten the cuff at the wrist.  It is a horribly cheap, and cheap looking, yet awesome feature."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Not waterproof like it says,1,This jacket says water proof and my husband wore it yesterday for work and it rained . He works outside and the jacket was wet through to the inside and still wet when he got home 8 hours later. Disappointed bec we missed the return window but it doesn’t rain often in southern California . Stuck now... maybe I can spray it with waterproofing and give it another try?
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Hose Me Down!,5,"I’ve purchased 2 jackets that claim they’re waterproof and they are not. Where as the OTU light men’s jacket has been. I purchased it mainly to wear on my scooter and chose the red color so I’d easily be seen. It fits very well (I ordered the men’s medium) and it has some great pockets to store my phone, glasses and mask. It also folds up compactly to store under my scooter seat compartment. But most of all it’s waterproof without being a heavy stiff “rubber ducky style” jacket. The first thing I did when I tried it on was turn the garden hose on myself and it kept me dry!I would be a repeat buyer for this products."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Nicer than expected,5,"I fly fish and regularly go out on cloudy, rainy days. Recently we moved to a temporary residence and had to put much of our belongings in storage until our new house is built. Stupidly, I forgot to set aside one of my 3 other rain jackets and found myself searching Amazon for a low cost alternative to tide me over (really, who needs 4 rain jackets?) . I didn't know the brand OTU but the reviews on this jacket were good, I fell in love with the grey camo color and so took a flyer on this one. I have to say I was impressed with the construction and quality, especially for the price. I would classify this as a medium weight rain jacket, it will protect from wind and rain and form an insulating layer. I have two that are much lighter and pack down much smaller, I have another guide jacket that is somewhat heavier. This slots right between them in terms of weight and bulk. The materials are high quality as is the stitching. The hood and collar (neck gaiter) are well designed and there is enough ease in it to fit over my waders. I am very pleased with this purchase."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Versatile and stylish,5,"My son loves this jacket. He is 13 years old, tall and slim. The medium fits him great with a little room to grow. He wore it in the snow with a warm hoody under, he wore it in early spring with a long sleeve tee, and now as the weather is warming up a bit he wears it with just a tee.It looks great on him as well. The gray, black white camo matches with most if his clothes.Very happy with this purchase"
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,A good light waterproof jacket.,5,"Got soaked going to work the other day. Really fundamentally drenched. I usually walk to work, and this particular day, my weather app said it wouldn't start raining until after I got up the hill to my place of occupation. I don't know why I trusted that thing since it was spitting when I left.Nevertheless, I got drenched, as I said. I don't carry an umbrella, as this wouldn't have helped me, anyway. It was also blowing up a mess and my umbrella would have been yanked inside out. Fat lot of good that would do. So when I got to work and dried off a bit, I decided to get myself a rain jacket. Now, this all happened in July, so I didn't want something heavy or that was gonna make me sweat. (I had a set of what they used to call ""thunderwear"" for on a motorcycle, so you could stay dry on a long trip, and I used those for a long time, but they were nightmarishly hot to wear in humid weather.I got this jacket and I ordered my typical size (XL). I'm 6'3"" and about 200lbs, with longer arms and I usually wear a large in a jacket, if I can try it on in the store. However, with online shopping I always err on the side of a size bigger, because you can never tell and you can always wear a sweater or other jacket under it as the weather cools off.This was a big jacket. I might have been okay with a large, but I'm happy for the XL. The sleeves are long, the jacket covers my butt and the detachable hood is very voluminous. Essentially, if you're looking for something that you can wear in the heat or the cool, this will do you good service, so long as you're willing to wear your winter sweater under it once it gets cold.The other good aspect of this larger size is that I can wear it over my backpack and keep it dry as well without sacrificing coverage elsewhere. I can still sip it up, etc.Of course, just like when you wash the car and it rains immediately, when you buy a raincoat, it will never rain again...Luckily there's a tropical depression overhead and I took it out in the rain the other day, just to see how it does and I'm telling you now, this isn't a water resistant piece of material. It is absolutely *waterproof*, FULL STOP. The material just beads the water and it goes running off and it and you stay dry as if it wasn't sloshing down. Seriously, this is great stuff. You will not get wet.However, the only slight issue is the ""hook and loop"" (we call this velcro—with a small v—) closures at the wrists DO get a little damp, so just be aware of that, but that's not going to keep you from enjoying a rainy walk to work or a day on the trail so long as your boots keep your feet dry and you don't go out in the lightning."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Raindrops Are Falling On My Head,5,"I bought this just in time for spring weather in Wisconsin. I’m a 6’1” female and love the length of this coat as well as the sleeve length. I like how lightweight it is...the color I chose, the fact it’s keeping me dry, the zippered pockets, the velcro placement. Heck...I like the whole jacket including the price tag and am considering buying another one in red."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great jacket,5,Great water resistant and lightweight windbreaker as well. Like 2 for one. If your looking then buy this. Its the one
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Nice jacket,5,"Very lightweight and packable. This jacket came in handy hiking the very wet Mist Trail at Yosemite National Park. Cut is very loose fitting, I ordered a size smaller than my normal jacket size and it fits perfectly. Blue color is great, it’s a dark navy and not too bright. This jacket is Good for Spring/fall hiking"
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,For light rain only.  Extremely disappointed in this 'rain' jacket.,1,The fit of the jacket is as advertised which I was initially worried about.  I wore this jacket in light rain a couple times and it performed fine although I wasn't outside for that long.  The disappointing part is in moderate to heavy rain your upper back and shoulders will be soaked if outside more than 2 minutes.  For what's advertised as a rain jacket that just seems misleading.  I wish I could return it but it's outside the window of return.  Oh well.
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,GREAT PRODUCT -- BUT,5,"Bought 2 of these, one for the wife (S) and one for me (L).  These are great.  They are lightweight, flexible, and soft.  And yes, they are water repellant-- as we have used them.  They look and feel like a light jacket.  The only con is:  The sleeves are gimoungousely long!  The (S) the sleeves are about 2 inches longer than normal  and on mine (L) they are are about 5 inches too long.  Why they make them like that??  Took them to a tailor and he shortened the sleeves to the proper length.  Now, we both love these coats.  Can be used even if its not raining as a simple jacket."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Loved it,5,"Purchased for a hiking trip of the 5 nat'l parks in Utah.  Needed something light for my pack in case of rain.I ended up wearing this jacket even when it wasn't raining.  I treated it more as an outer shell while layered underneath.  Temps were in the high 20's and low 30's most of the time.  It cut down a lot of the wind, but not all of it, which I didn't expect it to.  The jacket is vented and let in some breezes but that is to be expected.  The jacket helped release the heat from my body when it wasn't raining.The hood fit is probably my biggest disappointment.  It seemed a bit too big.  But it came in handy when I did encounter rain.  It's removable, but I just allowed it to flop around behind me when not in use.I've had Columbia shells before and I think they're too sloppy.  This had a nice fit.  The 'slimming' black color had me looking good in all the pictures my wife took.Considering buying another one in another color."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Jacket is Waterproof,5,"I just spent a day outside at the range with an all day drizzle and cold front that came in. After four hours I was dry from the rain and warm from the front. Jacket is light weight and works a described. The jacket runs a little smaller than the chart so I would order the next size up,, especially if you have bulky clothing underneath. Not a big deal here in Florida as I only had a 'T' shirt on underneath the jacket."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Dry As A Bone,5,"After years of braving the elements in cotton hoodies, I decided to smarten up and buy an actual rain coat. This jacket is lightweight but has a nice liner inside to help keep you warm on cool, rainy days. This won't keep you totally warm but fits into the ""windbreaker"" category of jackets. The hood is nice and big to keep us large-headed individuals dry and there are adjustable wrists at the end of the sleeves to help you stay dry. One feature that I was surprised about was that as you zip up the jacket, the Velcro patches catch to make sure you're all bundled up and ready for a slight drizzle or a potential downpour."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,He Loves It!,5,"My husband loves this jacket. We got one size larger because he likes a little extra room, and the fit was perfect. The jacket is definitely made well and water resistant. We would totally recommend."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Its a keeper,5,"Fit perfect 6'6"" 170lbs nice long arms, most are to short. Plenty of body length, doesnt hike up in the back, extra room inside for layering, excellant material and construction. Funky plastic strap for the wrist velcro tho. Will have to wait for it to rain in arizona to test water proof tho, that could be awhile lol. Over all very nice like the mesh lining keeps you seperated from the shell. Xxl"
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Nice, too large, not what I was looking for",4,"This is a nice rain jacket, solid build and looks protective. I didn't get to wear it in rain, because it was *way* too large. I am 5' 11"" at 195 pounds and ordered an XL, which is often the size I need, but this seems to be on the large side. An L would have sufficed.More importantly, this is NOT a lightweight jacket by any means, it is quite thick and also warm. Good for transition weather, but not for summer rains. Much too warm and too heavy (more than a pound), also doesn't pack small enough to be stowed away."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Good materials but problematic hood attachment design.,3,Good external material and comfortable interior material. The only potential problem is the way the hood zipper is attached directly to the jacket instead an external part of the jacket. This could allow water inside the jacket. A previous buyer has highlighted this and because of that I did a thorough inspection of this issue.
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,I have zero complaints!,5,"I'm 6'1, athletic build, 215 pounds and ordered a L, which fit perfectly. The hem on the jacket hits just right, and not too long like a lot of jackets. I couldn't believe I could actually see rain beading up on my jacket. Pretty cool. It is super lightweight and truly is a shell jacket, which is perfect, as it's function for me is a spring/summer raincoat, as I tend to wear a t-shirt underneath. I have a huge noggin and the hat portion of it actually covers my head. I try not to write reviews until I've lived with a product for a while and I gotta say, this one is a winner."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Nice light weight jacket,5,"Jacket fit well, plenty of room without oversized in the arms or length of jacket. Nice features such as Velcro closures along with zippers. Nice sized pockets, hood. Seems to be wind proof, haven’t done a beach walk yet, hubby said he stayed plenty warm at 60 degrees. Nice jacket no negatives at this time."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Beautiful Jacket But A Poor Hood,4,"The jacket, which I purchased in red, is really beautiful. Seems to be of good quality, substantial fabric. Can't speak to waterproofness yet, but will update if keeping the jacket. The hood is a poor design. Flops over your eyes, and the Velcro closures are a pain, never line up right. Snaps would have been better.Update 4/1/21Stood out in a downpour for about 10 minutes, stayed dry. Would it keep you dry out in a downpour for hours ? Probably not, but then again it's not a $100+ GoreTex jacket.Some have commented that the sleeves are too long. I find that a positive, as you can tuck your hands into the sleeves if it's chilly. The sleeves are easily adjustable with the Velcro straps.The fabric also has a nice texture to it.Bottom line, love the jacket. Quality product for the price."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Fits almost perfect,4,"I've not had a chance to wear it in the rain.  Hopefully soon?  So can't attest to its waterproofing. I've tried it on and fits almost perfect.  Sleaves are just a bit long and it is slightly baggy.  I'm fine with this as I plan to wear it over other clothes/jackets. As you see below, I'm 6'5"" and just over 250.  BIG GUY.  Hope this helps others to find the right fit."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Well worth the money,5,My wife and I are newly married. We like to dress up a lot with the same color clothes. We needed something that would be really good for the rain and also to keep the wind off the both of us. I feel since we have purchased these two jackets they’ve been extremely good to us. Also what I like about it is the color sticks out so if we’re out at night people can’t miss us.We are both in love with this type of jacket that we have now. I would also recommend it to anyone who is thinking about purchasing it.It’s well worth the money and also the investment. Well worth the money. I will add oh one more thing the jackets are very comfortable and they also fit perfect for us.
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great deal,5,I have not put it to the full test yet but it seems like really good quality for the price. Take note that this is not an insulated jacket but it will block the wind and it fits over other clothing easily.
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Fits great,5,"I wanted something that I knew my husband would not take lol, and he has yet to take this jacket. I like my jackets big. I got the largest size since I’m a woman and bigger up top."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Good looking, affordable and waterproof",5,"So far so good. For the price, I’m extremely happy, and think it compares to more expensive, less waterproof jackets I’ve had. The zippers work well and the inside pocket keeps everything in it perfectly dry."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,This Is Worth The Money,5,"I'm 5'-5"" and 145 lbs. This jacket is almost a perfect fit for me. It's fitted and not baggy like my old rain jacket. The sleeves are a bit long but the Velcro wrist straps take care of that. It's lightweight and definitely rainproof. The detachable drawstring hood and Velcro neck collar really protect my head, face, and neck from exposure. The inner net-like lining separates my body from the jacket shell and keeps me cool and not sweaty. Would buy it again."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great,5,"Great jacket for the money. Time will tell if the zippers hold up. At 6’2” and 175lbs, I am happy with the fit of the medium size, although the sleeves are just a tad long for my taste. The hood zips off and goes back on with ease. The dark grey color will match most if not all of my attire, and the material doesn’t feel or look like you’re wearing a trash bag. As for water resistance, I have not been in a downpour yet, but my water bottle did spill a bit, and the water beaded and ran right off."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Nice looking jacket, just not for freezing temps",4,Very nice jacket for the price. But has no insulation so if your looking for something to keep you warm in freezing temps you may look elsewhere or this jacket would be great as an outside layer. When it's cold I'll put a sweater or jacket underneath this one and then the cold is tolerable. But nice fitment no complaints there
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Love it,5,It’s comfortable and made from great material it’s not too warm which is good though because rain coats usually get you all sweaty. I use it for work but it would be great to wear for everyday life
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Dumb Hood,3,I would have given this jacket a much higher rating if not for the hood. The hood is huge and even with the adjustment strings it slides down over my eyes.  Also the rain flap on its attachment zipper stupidly faces UP so water can run down into it and onto your neck. Really thoughtless design.
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Nice jacket; pleasantly surprised.,5,"I was hesitant to buy this as a few of the reviews said this was Chinese sized. I wear a. US 2xl so that's what I ordered. I was pleasantly surprised it fit so well with plenty of room to move freely in it.It's not designed for warmth so it would be great in the summer on a windy rainy day but you won't burn up in it either.All in all, it's a really nice jacket and I highly recommend.Will update after using it for a bit."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great Shell,5,"I needed a new shell for hiking the AT and saw this.  Wow what great quality.  Fits perfect as I wanted some room to wear layers underneath.  I am 5' 10"" and weigh 225lbs.  The XL was just the right size for this.  One inside the coat pocket about 5 in by 6 inches and seals.  lining is great and the hood is removable.  The only thing missing is a carrying pouch or bag to stow it in, otherwise it's a great coat."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"The coat is beautifully made, but the arm length is waaay tooo long",4,"Like I said, it's well made and it looks good when you put in on, except for the arm length.I am trying to figure out how to shorten it which may be a bit of a challenge.I purchased it because I have to power spray my house especially under the eves, and anyone who has even done that knows that the water gets all over the place.I'll keep it anyway and hopefully I can make the alterations."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Light weight,5,"truly is light weight. shed the rain fine ,but it wasnt a real drencher of a downpour. seems like it will work just fine. breathes nicely. Bought an extra large and was surprised by American sizing not your typical undersized Asian sizes .This will work out well for me as I intend to wear it over a hoodie and/or a jacket  when I fly-fish. Cammo pattern was black and white ,but should be fine."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Fantastic for here to there no matter the occasion,5,Very impressive. Read all prior comments about the fitting. I measured myself to chart. Fits as chart measurement scales.  The Blue is more of a Royal Blue (dark blue with a shade of purple). Ptefect early spring and fall coat. Very classy with shirt and tie. Love it!
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Not meant for backpacking. Not for warmer weather,3,This is a great jacket for normal purposes. This is not a good rain jacket for hiking or backpacking.  It’s too warm in warmer weather and not that light so you can just use it as the outer most layer of your clothes. Great for using around town not good for backpacking.
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Surprised by the quality 😁,5,"I was truly surprised by the quality and craftsmanship of this product. Before purchasing it I was looking at other raincoats from North face, colombia, LL Bean.For one third less the price of the other raincoats this is a superb buy. I recommend it 👍"
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Quality,5,"This is a very nice quality jacket for the price. It fit very well. No too big and not too tight. I am 5'10"" 205 lbs. athletic build. It has not been out in the rain yet. I wore it in 30 degree windy conditions and it was warm with a fleece vest under it."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Exactly what I was looking for,5,Honestly I just bought it so I had some type of rain jacket but this specific one for photography for the person in the photo. It is very vibrant. And it really holds up as far as keeping you dry! Very comfy and feels like it will last if you take care of it. Not suited for winter. It keeps the rain out not the cold. (Light jacket)
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,After 10 mins in rain,2,"Bought this to go stomping in puddles with my tiny human. Picture is my shirt underneath after about 5-10 minutes outside, my hair was soaked. It wasn't that hard of rain and I have only used it one other time. I guess it's better than nothing?"
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Love this raincoat. Perfect with a hoodie,5,Got a skinny guy here who actually found a raincoat worthy of his stuff-always-too-damn-short-for-my-long-arms problem. He is 5’11” weighs 145 and has a reach that’s unmatched for me but hey at least I can fit into coats at the store. He puts his arms out and the cuffs always fall to his forearms. Not this coat. Skinny enough he doesn’t puff out and tall enough he gets wrist coverage! Winning!
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Good fit, extra features, good quality construction",5,"Well designed, with velcro closures along the main zipper line, to keep the flap closed against hard rain. Fit is as expected, with room for warm layers under the jacket. Hood zips off.Quality construction.I'm headed to a rainy part of the Andes next week. We'll see how it performs. I anticipate no problems.I recommend this product."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Large is actually large,5,better than expected.  it has a nice hood for keeping out rain.  quality is unusually good for this price.  walked in rain twice and the jacket kept me dry.  I usually find Large to be snug.  5'9 170lbs and this jacket fits with a heavy sweater.  no problem.  highly recommend this jacket for light rain jacket.  not insulated so this is a top cover in 30 to 50 degrees.
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Not waterproof at all. DO NOT BUY. JUNK..,1,Looks good and that's where it stops. 2nd time wearing the jacket and I got soaked and both times the rain wasn't heavy. It was a light lingering rain.. Look elsewhere for a true waterproof jacket. Do not buy.
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Very light weight waterproof rain jacket,5,"I ordered one in extra large. That’s the size I use for all my sweatshirts and jackets. It was a little loose, but good if it was cold and needed to wear a thicker sweater under. The large is perfect, wearing a tee shirt, but not much else.  Very waterproof, water just beads off. The extra large would have been fine in all applications, but I like this jacket so much I didn’t mind buying two of them."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Sizing!,5,Finally found a size that fits! I'm 6'3 with a 46 chest and first purchased the xl which was waaay to bug so I went with med next and it was on the snug size.. last but not least I got the LG and it's a perfect fit. Has enough room for a hoodie when it gets cold. I love the style and quality of the material. Ill post another review when I get in some rain.
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Can't beat the value,5,"This rain jacket is just as good as those brand name jackets from those ""outdoor/named after a nature location"" stores, but at a fraction of the price. Definitely worth the price. Waterproof as advertised."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great Rain Jacket,4,This lightweight rain jacket does the job. It does a great job shedding the rain.

All-in-all a great addition to your foul weather wardrobe.

Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Worst,5,"This jacket is great for the price point. It doesn't stand up to a driving downpour, but it will keep you dry in a pop up shower. It is unbeatable in the wind. It blocks the wind and the hood has an elastic band with adjustable drawstring loops so it doesn't just fall off when you put it up. I bought it specifically for working (I am a landscaper) and it has been well worth it. The only real downside is that it doesn't breathe, so while you aren't getting rained on, you are sweating if it is a warm day."

Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Cool looking, good jacket for the price.",4,I love the red color and overall look of the jacket.Wore it in the rain last week and it worked as hoped for.

Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Excellent Product,5,"My son is 12 yrs. Old, 5'3, 105 lbs. Average build, height and weight. I'm glad I read the reviews and ordered him a medium. It's a tiny to big. But, he has has room to grow into it. Love it. Nice color, size, well made. Will purchase on for myself."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Good Quality, Well Designed",5,Good quality. Would order again. The size runs big.

The blue is navy blue not purplish color. Overall the jackets fit a little big especially the sleeves but they it compensates by being very comfortable, warm and waterproof 💧. I tested it out in the recent rain 🌧 in NY and it wicked away the moisture. Outstanding !!!!"

Saw something similar in target for around 55 dollars so I’m glad I bought this one. Adiós"
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Too flimsy,3,It is not as waterproof as I would have hoped. Seems more water repellent than waterproof. Also was hoping it would be heavier. Also interior lining was not described and it is mesh netting that gets snagged on clothes.
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Pretty good,4,"You get what you pay for. This jacket doesn't cost as much as a designer equivalent. The hood drawstrings on mine broke after a couple of uses to the point I had to replace them with a shoestring. Not having some kind of tightener on the hood makes it pretty useless in windy environments. Aside from that, great product."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Appears to be good quality material and the size was good.,5,So far from just putting the jacket on and trying it I like it as it fits well and it looks like it’s made of good quality material.

Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Repels water,5,I use this to accomplish outdoor chores when it's raining.  I don't get wet.

Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Amazing value.,4,"Very good rain jacket. Light enough to not notice it but heavy enough to block some wind too.  Overall a good purchase and an exceptional value for the price.  Only downside is it's not the most breathable, but it's very difficult to find a good rain jacket that is."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,FITS A SIZE 44JJ BUST,5,"My daughter searched high and low for comfortable, long sleeve raincoat that would accommodate the fact that she has a uncommonly large bust.She is a 44JJ size bust and this coat worked for her.  I was surprised since it was a men's jacket but it worked fantastic for her.Good quality, fairly lightweight.Not heavy duty and I would not call this cheap. We are very happy with our purchase.Waist will fit hips up to about a ""size 24"" in women's."

Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Completely Soaked,1,"Had high hopes for this jacket. First time wearing it, for 2 hours in a steady drizzle, I came away with a completely soaked shirt. The jacket was zipped up all the way, velcro sealed, and chin strap attached to keep the hood up. Water came straight through the jacket. I tried including a photo of the shirt I was wearing under the jacket but Amazon rejected it because it wasn't of the product in question....so you'll have to use your imagination. If you're really looking for good protection in wet conditions, look elsewhere."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Excellent quality,5,"The first try was too small, but the quality was good enough that I returned the first for a second that was larger.

Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Good visible color and fit but too sweaty,3,"I got this to walk in my neighborhood and wanted something to keep me dry and be very visible, and it is. Also the detachable hood is plus. However this jacket will get you sweaty rather quickly in the body. The sleeves are lined differently and are even quicker to get you sweating."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Who knows for whom the bell rolls?,5,This looks and feels like a quality raincoat. I haven’t given it to my skinny-as-hell brother yet. But it looks like the small will fit. The removable hood is a nice extra.
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Not waterproof...,2,"It's a nice jacket, but one big flaw... The zipper on the hood catches water.

Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great rain coat for great price.,5,Great price for a great rain jacket.

Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great Product!,4,"My raincoat came just as pictured, i bought a size Medium & it fits just right, but the cuffs for the sleeve have this velcro strapping to enclose the wrist area, but it looks & feels soo atrange to me.Living in the caribbean & currently in the hurricane season which is why i bought this jacket, i have yet to test it out in any rainy weather for now, so i cant speak on how it holds under heavy to moderate rainy weather"

Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Simply not waterproof,1,"It is dishonest for the seller to call this waterproof.  It is not.  The day after it arrived, I took my dog for a 90 minute walk in a light, ongoing rain.  I was soaked at the end.  Both shoulders got wet to the skin through the jacket, then a fleece and shirt.  It is simply not waterproof and it's wrong to say it is.  At best, it would keep you dry on a foggy day or maybe in a light mist for a short period of time."
Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Light weight and well-made,5,Light weight and well-made. The jacket fits well and it’s sturdy enough but also lightweight. Perfect when you’re going hiking it doesn’t have talk to your bag.

Last week I wore it to hike near Mt Rainer during a light steady shower for 4 hours and got soaked. Product is better described as water resistant, instead of water proof."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Comfortable, affordable",2,"Pros: Comfortable, affordable, not undersized. Currently available in tan, which is strangely hard to find in other full zip fleece jackets right now.Cons: Sheds fuzz like crazy. Makes me doubt its durability, though so far it's holding up. Using Columbia Steens Mountain as a baseline, it's heavier than I expected. A bit too warm indoors. The currently trendy cuffless sleeve design is also an annoyance. I'll willingly pay a bit more for the Columbia next time.Edit: After two or three wash cycles now, the fuzz ball shedding issue seems to be going away.Update: a couple of months later, as I feared, visible signs of wear. Elbows are shiny. I have to conclude the product is not a good value even at its well-below-average price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Keeps you warm and Toasty in any Condition,5,"I've been wearing Polar fleece since the Army place this into their inventory in 2005. Not only does this keep you warm but is so snugly and comfortable when you sleep. I've worn fleece clothing on the coldest and snowy mountain tops of Afghanistan and it has always kept me warm. If  you've ever been stationed in Germany during the winter then you know how cold it gets there but with Fleece sweater I didn't even need a Jacket, its perfect for any condition. I prefer Fleece over cotton cause it wont wont absorb the sweat and soak the material and it wont shrink on you. Love me some Fleece!!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Near Perfect but... Ordered 4 2 of 4 Pilling and shedding after two times wearing!,3,"This is a near perfect item.What I like:1. The design of the sweatshirt is near perfect.2. The sweatshirt is not shiny like silk PJ's.3. The sweatshirt is warm.4. The material is soft and comfortable.5. The price is somewhat fair.6. There is no LOGO saying I want to show everyone I am an idiot and pay excessive amounts of money to be a walking billboard for (insert whatever company here) but I can be part of this crowd even if I have to max out my credit and go into debt at least I am someone.  It makes you an advertisement vessel a walking billboard that you pay handsomely for. Educate yourself stop the nonsense. Its one thing to support and buy local things and spend excessively but all clothing is made in the same locations with essentially the same materials. These days we are not supporting anything other than overpayment and debt for our fellow man and ourselves. A worker making the clothing is likely still payed a repulsive amount of money in poor conditions and you help build empires to support this! ""A Brand DOES NOT maketh the man!""7. The full zipper nothing like having to shed this layer and having to pull it off over your head a full zipper allows easy removal without having your gut hanging out or having the zipper get caught in your hair. And if you have to hold another item in your hand while taking it off you can do so in comfort.What I dislike about this product:1. Elastic on the sleeve and bottom I prefer the open concept  relaxed fit everywhere. No more elastic please!2. Zippers on the pocket are very uncomfortable for someone who frequently uses their pockets as I do get rid of them!3. Material quality needs work 2 out of 4 of these sweaters are shedding badly and pilling up after 2 uses and a single wash actually they started doing this after the first year of 10 hours in a working environment just the rubbing caused it and my t-shirt underneath was also covered in black fuzz! Quality Control is needed!4. The stiffness of sweatshirt it does not bend and flow as freely as it should mostly due to elastic and material.5. The black coloring should be darker.Conclusions:This is a near perfect sweatshirt I may even buy more or try to get replacements for the faulty sweatshirts. I have found if you take a wide-toothed comb to the sweatshirts that are pilling you can comb it out and make it look somewhat decent again. (Not something I prefer to do but if need be I suppose I will.) I believe if you washed this sweatshirt a couple of times before wearing it maybe 3 times it may aid in the prevention of such issues as I noticed was cycle seemed to improve the pilling and shedding a little bit. I really wish elastic around the sleeves and bottom were gone to allow the sweatshirt to flow and move more naturally while active as I dislike how fashion right now seems to be centered around being a stiff.To buy or not to buy that is the question?Overall I would suggest this full zip fleece as one of the better bangs for your buck and it may be advantageous to support the startup of the Amazon Essentials clothing brand to ensure there will be good and affordable clothing in the future. I say probably buy this sweatshirt there is a 50% chance you will get a good one and to be on the safe side wash it about 3 times before wearing it.Note to Amazon:You guys are on the right track just a few improvements and you will be a home run product even if you need to charge a few bucks more lets do it and get it done!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,5,"Medium-weight 100 percent polyester fleece is used to create this simple classic style zip-front jacket. The stand-up collar measures 2 1/2 inches high. Both the garment’s straight bottom hem and sleeve hems are a slim 1/4 inch. And although a casing with elastic is not obvious, both areas respond in a similar way, slightly expanding when pulled.The sizing is exactly as expected. The male in residence normally wears a large jacket but wanted to wear this over a sweater on cold but not frigid winter days when layering makes sense. This size-up is definitely one size larger – no more, no less. The jacket is warm and comfortable, and it looks quite good on him. The design is inherently flattering..Basic construction. The main zipper is a heavy-duty nylon model with a large easy-to-pull metal tab. Two in-seam vertical pockets have a nylon zipper closure so they secure the contents and do not cause the fabric to sag open, helping to neatly maintain the jacket’s silhouette.There are two large interior pockets on either side of the zipper that measure 7 1/2 x 11 1/2 inches. They are placed at the mid-point of the front panels extending to the bottom hem edge. These pockets do sag open a bit so they are partially visible when the jacket is un-zipped. This is a minor issue and the additional pocket capacity increases functionality.The sewing is excellent with the stitches even with no hanging threads and all interior seams are finished which eliminates raw edges for a neat appearance. There is no hanging loop and there is a sewn-in back label. Fabric care instructions are to machine wash cold with like colors, no bleach, tumble dry on low heat, no iron and no dry cleaning. Basic, handsome easy care jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Its GOOOD..... here's why...,5,"If you are in dilemma to buy Columbia fleece or Amzn essential fleece, I will vote for Amzn, I recently tried a Columbia but it kind of looked very unprofessional even for casual wear, the collar didn't stood uptight and the hand pockets were not flush to the jacket and were hanging out a bit. Since this amzn one has a zipper to outer hand pockets they stay snug to your body. This jacket also has two internal pockets for keeping stuff (without  zip). All in all it's a bargain to buy at this low price. I love the color, it appears a bit on a lighter shade than displayed but great for dressing up or down."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Just as good as LLBean and Cabelas,4,"Very good quality, nice weight, true to color. However the sizes do run large.  Beware Amazon will not give a full refund on returned items in some cases."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Good for tall women, too!",5,"I bought a pink one from the ladies version, which fit well enough but was a little short ( I’m 5’9”). So then I thought I’d try the men’s version,  and I like it better. Note: the fit is men's; so it doesn't nip in at the waist and is snugger around the hips. I have a fairly straight body and broad shoulders, so it works for me...but if you have big hips and narrow shoulders, you'd be better off with the women's style in terms of cut:)The jacket is lightweight yet warm, and has 4 pockets- 2 very deep interior pockets which hold giant phones, masks, keys, shades-  and 2 zippered front pockets which are nice for hands. If you stuff a lot in these zippered pockets it may make you look like you’ve got a gut going on, lol.I got a medium which is a little loose, but I can wear layers under it.My husband, who hates any synthetic material, was intrigued enough by this that he wants one, too, since we don’t use heat in the winter (CA) and he works from home."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,2nd Not As Good As The 1st,1,"Almost 3 years ago I bought this jacket in a solid-navy(small). I liked it and I'm wearing it today.  So i ordered a second  navy-geo(small) this month, and it is a different jacket and not in a good way. It's cut  smaller, the fabric feels much lighter and it isn't as warm.  The older jacket was made in Mexico, and this one was made in Vietnam.  I don't recommend the jacket now. I would send it back, but I made the mistake of washing it first. According to the package if it is washed you cannot return it."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Surprisingly nice, well done Amazon Essentials.",5,"I ordered this because the Women's version was no longer available in navy blue and I have to wear navy at work.As a 5'6"" woman at 150lbs, the men's small fits me beautifully. It's a bit longer in the body than I'm used to, but the sleeves are a perfect length (I have long arms) and I may have to start ordering more men's jackets as this one doesn't bind at the shoulders at all.The pockets are very nicely sized and it's lovely that they zip. I get tired of things falling out of my pockets on my old jacket.While it's described by some as a mid-weight fleece jacket, I'd say it's a bit lighter than that. I mostly use it to keep from freezing indoors in a poorly insulated hospital, but it's appropriate for short trips outdoors in 40 degree weather as well."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Soft and Warm,4,"I ordered two for layering under our coats. My husbands came first.  I hope mine is just as nice.  It feels heavy enough to keep him warm under his coat. Soft enough where it won't feel funny on his skin when he wear it in Spring or Fall by itself.  Good product for good price. Hope it lasts. Now onto the pocket issue. This is actually the pouch for the outside pocket, but because it is sewn down inside the jacket, it looks and can actually be used as an inside pocket. I don't think it is sewn like this in all jackets which is why some say they do or do not have an inside pocket. I hope it is sewn this way in mine.  I would truly recommend."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Great value, Great quality",5,"Great value - very well made fleece. Not super warm so better for layering than as a top layer. I am 6'2"" 235lbs and a L fits with a little extra room. Sleeves are long enough, waist sits as in the picture; a bit low, nice if you are trying to keep warm, not a great jacket for indoors (like a gym, or office) where you will be sitting on it a lot."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Very comfortable, good looking and perfect fit",5,"This fleece jacket is very soft and comfortable, looks good and a perfect fit (if I was 5kg/10lbs heavier I would go for large already).I am 176cm/85kg (5'9 / 187lbs) with an athletic build and this medium jacket fits me perfectly.Love the fact that it has no logo on it as I don't like to be a walking advertisement for any brand.Attached some images. Obviously looks better in real life than in the images.Too early to comment about quality/durability, and hence it is also impossible to comment about value. If it lasts it is superb value and if it doesn't, then, atleast it didn't bring bankrupt."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Amazon knocked it out of the park!,5,"I bought this on a whim about a year ago, not having much in the way of expectations. Now it's probably the single article of clothing I wear the most.PROS-Warm, and layers well! I travel all over the country at all times of year, and having this fleece with me makes it easy to adapt. It keeps me cozy on its own down to about 50 degrees. Throw a light or medium weight jacket over it, it'll get me down to about freezing. With a good parka, it gets me down to...well, I haven't found the bottom of that yet. Anyway, it will boost the warmth of just about anything by 15 or 20 degrees.-Comfy! Like I sleep in it most winter nights. It's like someone made my favorite blanket into a shirt.-Versatile! I have yet to find an outfit that's awkward with this fleece. Looks great with a leather jacket, field jacket, peacoat, parka, tshirt, oxford shirt, preppy tie, old jeans, new jeans, chinos... basically I can wear it with anything but a tuxedo.-Clean! Meaning it always looks washed and sharp. Being on the road so much, I often only wash my clothes every two or three weeks. The before and after wash of this fleece is identical.-Durable! It's over a year old and still looks brand new.CONS-Runs a little large. I'm 5'9 and around 150 pounds. I got the small, but it fit somewhere between a small and medium. But I usually get my clothes altered anyway. After I got the bagginess at the sides and under the arms taken in, it looked fantastic!-The cord pull attached to the zipper broke off pretty fast. It's not a big deal for me though- I think it looks better without it.So much use and pleasure out of this, AND IT'S $20!!! I don't know how Amazon got so much right at this price.Get one. Get three. I'm just about to order another."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Cheap is cheap.,1,Zipper fails on the first use. Cheap is cheap is cheap. So discouraging that a company with the reputation of Amazon would carry a piece of junk like this.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Made with attention to detail, but might be an odd fit",3,"I buy hiking gear, and I'm discerning. I'll buy inexpensive, but never cheap. I tend to notice details others might miss, which makes the difference between the two. This jacket was not only inexpensive, but one of those times when the stars align. In short, I paid $12 for it. But here's where the distinction between inexpensive and cheap makes all the difference. Something I look for in a garment with zippers are three letters: YKK. The best hiking gear brands use YKK zippers. Not only does this Amazon Essentials jacket use them, but other garments they offer, as well. That one detail makes me comfortable that they have paid similar attention to the rest of the details. The fleece is dense, even luxurious, and after a couple of washes, pilling is at a minimum. It's a really nice, simple, fire engine red. Inside pockets are another plus, large enough to fit a small tablet, gloves, or a sandwich. To this point, you might be wondering, ""Three stars? Sounds like you love it!"" Well, so with people as with clothing, you start to find flaws. First, while it otherwise fits well, it's two inches too long; it almost covers my inseam. The collar acts weird. It doesn't look or feel right with the collar up, but pulled down flat, it looks and feels fine. I just don't enjoy wearing that way. Those peccadilloes aside, it's a quality garment that I wish I could have given four stars. I typically only give five stars for products that saved my life. Had this one done everything I wanted, it would gotten a strong four. Why didn't I return it? It's a nice jacket with a couple of flaws for $12."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Female buyer info!!!,2,I’m not reviewing the fleece based on performance.... but just writing this to help if women go to purchase this fleece. I need a red/red tone fleece for work. The women fleece have Red and a Maroon one but with blue trim.... which I feel looks tacky. So I opted for the men’s fleece. The fleece itself feels nice and decent quality. Mid weight. In womens i normally buy a large- for a little room. I purchased medium in the men’s. The hips and torso fit like a large. Doesn’t contour but I didn’t expect that in the men’s sizing. Anyway the arms are sooooooooo wide. Not a good look. Or rather not the look I’m going for. I feel they are wider than I normally see. So I’m not saying this is a bad fleece in any way. But for me doesn’t work and I’ll be returning.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"☆☆☆☆☆Great Fit, Soft Material And Super Price! 5 Star Buy!!",5,"This Amazon Essentials Zip Up Fleece Jacket is exactly as I hoped. I got it for my husband who is 6'4 240 lbs. and the XXL fit perfectly. The jacket has 2 open inside pockets and 2 nice sized zippered pockets outside which is great b/c he's always cramming stuff in his pockets and losing everything. Hopefully he will use the zippers! The main Zipper Is Metal, feels strong and has a zipper pull attached.  The 100% Polyester Fleece is super soft and feels much more expensive than a $17 jacket. The size is perfect, he can put this over a sweatshirt or hoodie but it isn't to bulky to fit under a coat if needed. This was definitely a 5 star buy."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,No Elasticized Cuffs,1,"Bought one of these last year and liked it so much I decided to by another one in a different color this year. Unlike the last one (and different from the description) these cuffs WERE NOT elasticized, at least not to the extent to keep the cuffs from just hanging down around your wrist instead of having a snug fit. I wish companies would leave there designs alone from year to year. If seems if you don't get 2 or 3 of whatever you like at one time, if you wait any length of time, there is no guarantee that what you order later will be the same.Am returning this."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Cheap and comfy,4,"I wanted another light zip up fleece to wear on days in the 40’s and low 50’s over a long sleeved t shirt or short sleeve t shirt. This was nicely priced. I like the fit of it. I’m 221 lbs, 5’11 with a long upper torso and broad shoulders. An XL fit great and hits just below the belt line. Fleece seems decent quality and not really heavy.I’ll post an update after it’s washed a few times, but for less than $18 I’m not expecting much!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,as warm and as comfortable as my North Face fleece that cost 4x more,4,"Working from Home in New England with the weather getting colder, means switching from hoodies to something a bit warmer as my daily ""work outfit"".  Instead of wearing my same North Face fleece every day, I needed a couple more affordable fleeces for my winter WFH wardrobe rotation.Though a bit skeptical that at $20 these Amazon Basic fleeces would look and feel ""cheap"" I bought 2.  To my surprise the fleece doesn't look or feel cheap, they feel warm, cut well - not too baggy or tight, and its quite soft.  In terms of softness, they are both far more comfortable than my comparatively more ""rigid"" North Face fleece that costs 4 times as much!  I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a warm comfortable fleece and a great price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great quality and value for the money.,5,"This is a sturdy, well-made fleece jacket.  The zippers seem very strong.  The outside pockets, which also have zippers, are very large.  The inside pockets don't have zippers but are quite large also.I'm a pretty standard medium (5'9"", 170) and it fits me well although both the arms and body length are longer than my other fleece jacket from another company.  Most importantly, it keeps me very warm."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Good value and quality - slightly inconsistent sizing,5,"I've bought 2 of these jackets, both Medium in the Buffalo Plaid patterns -- was trying to decide between the them and ended up with both the charcoal and the red.First, bought the charcoal.  Out of the package, it felt a bit snug in the chest and body, but the sleeves were perfect.  After wearing it a couple of times, the fabric flexed and the jacket fit very well.  I wear 41-43 suit/sport jackets, depending on cut, and alpha-sized tops M or L.  Glad I did not size up to large.I like the on-seam pockets and the tucked-away zippers; the pockets don't billow out.  The interior pockets are fairly large...could tuck a glove in each.  The fabric breathes, though the downside is that it doesn't cut the wind so much.  A thermal tee or dense sweatshirt/flannel shirt underneath would work on a cold (but not frigid) day with some wind.The red jacket's fabric and color is just as nice, but it fits a bit bigger in the body, so glad I stuck with the M.  There is plenty of room for a bulkier second layer with this jacket.Can't speak to durability, yet, but will add to this review if it proves to be sub-par.  Both pieces seem well put together.  At this point, $15-20 (depending on discounts) seems like a great value for jackets with these features."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great value but not polar weight fleece,4,"This is listed as a polar fleece, but it is a mid-weight fabric at best. Seeing a decent camo pattern on a value-priced fleece was the real draw for me. Unfortunately, the sizing is a bit too generous.I am 6'1"" 240lbs with a 44/45"" chest depending on cut. My weight means I have a belly right now, so consider that in my sizing review. The XL fits in the chest and doesn't bind in the armpits. I was surprised that the XL was still a little loose around my belly. I would describe the cut of this fleece as a roomy cut (as opposed to athletic, fitted, or regular fits). Once I drop my winter weight, I will need to replace this with a large. The sleeves felt right and I usually wear a 35/36"" sleeve in dress shirts. The length of the jacket was below the belt, but didn't cover my butt.Overall, this is a great value but I would have preferred a more fitted cut, longer waist, and a true polar weight fabric."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great Unisex Jacket,5,"I got this in medium in my favorite buffalo plaid  - medium size. Fits me like it was custom made . I'm  a 5-9"" gal with long arms. It has great attention to detail, very well made. There are two large inside pockets {great for phone, keys whatever) in addition to the two outside zipped pockets . Nice quality fleece that is great to wear outside in fall or inside over a sweater if you like extra warmth in the winter.You won't be disappointed!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Horrible sizing,1,"I originally bought the Buffalo Check fleece in a large, and that ran too small.  The arms were the right length but the torso was too tight and short.  Then I returned it and got a XL... that one the arms are so ridiculously long that it seems like it was made for an orangutan. The torso is gigantic on the XL also...So, unless you are a massive guy, or very thin, the  just avoid this all together.  So dissatisfied and disappointed.The only plus is the design is quite nice."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Jacket is made well,5,"I bought this for my father to slip on, especially while at my house to stay warm. My father is at an age that he lives nicely with the heat turned up to 90 degrees. I am at an age that I am starting menopause. I turned up the heat a bit and hope this fleece jacket would help us both.  The jacket is made very well. My father loves the jacket since it keeps him warm. I think if I bought this again I would go for a larger size. I would like extra room for heavier shirts underneath. We both like the look of the jacket on him. The vendor mailed this out to us very quickly. Thank you for solving our problem."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,For the price this jacket is a best buy  5/5,5,"Just got this today ... with a bit of uncertainty.  I read some critical reviewsthat gave me pause, but I went ahead and ordered it because of the fantasticprice. I am so glad I did.The jacket is made from medium light polar fleece that is very soft and warm.It is a light jacket, like a sweater but it wicks away moisture and is verycomfortable.  So far I like it and have had it on all day.  The lengths is justslightly below the belt.  The sleeves are the right length and the cuffs do notsqueeze my wrist, but they are also not too loose.The very large pockets have zippers on them, and they do not have any holesin them or openings to the inside of the jacket.  I am already thinking of gettinganother color.Amazon Essentials are getting to be very good.  Very well done - 5/5"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great jacket,5,"He loved it. Well made. 6’2 and 180 and a large fit perfect.He was wearing a hoodie all the time working at home but did not want the hood part. As soon as he tried this on it’s hardly ever come off. Loose enough to wear all day. Sleeves the right length. Overall Length is good. He is always cold working in our basement and this solved the issue. Even the raised collar looks more professional than the hoodie when doing work video calls (if that matters in your line of work, like it does his). Net is this was the cost of 2 weekday lunches out and well worth it. I’m tempted to get one for myself now, too. Don’t hesitate."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Bought As A Gift,4,"Bought this jacket for my little nephew’s birthday.  He is turning 15 and recently took a growth spurt.  He’s hovering between a Large & XL in most clothes.  I opted for the XL, as I was not sure how this jacket would fit.  Glad I didn’t order the Large, because it would have definitely been too tight.  The jacket seems to be a fitted style.  It is not as soft & stretchy as I thought it would be.  The material is a bit stiffer, esp compared to his Land’s End fleece jacket, which I also bought for him.  Hoping it will soften up a bit once washed.  He likes the blue camo color and pocket options, so he’s quite happy with it.  For the money, it seems to be a good deal, as it was much more reasonably priced, compared with the Land’s End version."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Light-weight, basic fleece.  Priced right and perfect middle layer for snowboarding.",5,"Bought this because my new snowboard jacket didn't come with a liner.  Bought the blue camo version, and it goes perfectly with my boarding jacket and is also nice and warm enough to wear on its own (depending on what' you're doing, of course).It dries quickly when the sleeves got a little wet from snow.  It was about 37*F where I'm sitting in the back of my truck at the bottom of the mountain with little to no wind, and it kept me warm.  I still needed my outer layer for wind and water protection when riding the slopes, but the fleece made sure I was warm, dry, and comfy underneath.  In the mid 40's, I am able to take off my outer shell and just sport my fleece while snowboarding.  Did I mention that it looks great?Great value, good jacket, 5 stars!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Zipper Didn't Work Properly,1,I returned one of these because the zipper didn't work properly.  The zipper on the replacement was even worse.  It sounded like a good deal but the jacket was unusable.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,great fleece jacket and value!!,5,"I had originally ordered on of these but sent the wrong size....not to fret, I had gifted it to a friend who loves it and fits him perfectly.  I then had to wait until the color I wanted came back in stock and when it did, was notified and ordered immediately.  It arrived (in the correct size) and I've worn it nearly every day since.  I tend to run warm as a rule so don't like things that turn out to be too much and overtly warm when I'm out.  This is the perfect weight and warmth and is soft with inside pockets which I love and wears beautifully....definitely the one to buy if you're looking for a quality fleece at a great price!!!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Must buy! Super cute on my boyfriend,5,"I bought this for my BF so we could have matching thanksgiving outfits delivered next day and to my surprise because of the low price; this jacket fit him perfectly, and was very well made. He said it was warm and very comfortable. I used the size chart provided to order and it was spot on!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Good light jacket,5,"I like this jacket.  The fleece is not polar, by any means, but it is a good lightweight cover.  I am 5-11 and 160 lbs. Size large fits perfectly, not baggy like some of these.  And the length is just below the waist, unlike some that are too long.  Front zipper works, handy pocket zippers work. Inside pockets are large enough for folded papers, etc.  Enough elastic on arms to hold up sleeves.  Good for layering under another jacket or wearing inside if a little cool.  Good zip sweater!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,I'm impressed,5,"I was looking for an inexpensive fleece to wear while on my shifts in the hospital. This looked like the most bang for the buck. Overall I'm happy. It has 2 pockets to hole keys, cards, pens, etc. It's warm but not too hot. It's soft (i haven't washed it yet so that may change). Fit is on par with what I typically wear. I'm 5'10, 41"" chest and 34"" waist. Most things I wear in large and this is just right. If it shrinks a little after the first wash I'll be ok with that. Overall I'm happy and fits what I need; something that can get trashed in the hospital and I won't feel like I lost anything important. It's worth the $20 I spent.If anything changes, will update..."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Nice quality well-made fleece. Great deal!,5,This fleece is made very well and has a nice fit. It’s actually nicer than some of my much more expensive brands such as Columbia or Patagonia. For this price point AMAZON has done a great job with the craftsmanship there is no hanging threats and it has nice structure in a little bit of stretch at the waist on the bottom to cling to you and keep you warm. There are good solid zippers and I like the fact that there are zippers on the pockets on the outside +2 inner pockets on both sides. Very good price point and after receiving one I bought one for a family member and they love it. Fall and winter is here pick up one of these for yourself and for a gift. There’s a nice selection of patterns for everyone.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,The price reflected the quality,1,"I just got this yesterday. As the old saying goes: ""you cannot get good things for cheap,"" This is so true. The cut and fitting is just usually, nothing to talk about, it's just another fleece jacket.BUT, this is NOT a ""POLAR FLEECE"" as the product suggested.  The fleece is very thin,(if I wore this in Texas last week, I'd be frozen the death already).This is a house clothing, not meant for outdoor use. It has NONE of the outdoor fleece required details like; draw strings at the bottom to prevent the up drifting; there is no flap to cover the zip end at the top of collar, so if you zip the jacket all the way up, your chin will rub against it; and there is not closure for the sleeves. Overall, it is a house dress at the best.I will update the quality after a few washes, then, we will know...to be continued."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,6 (or more) Stars,5,"I just received this item and was eager to try it on.  I actually ordered it for cycling in the early morning when the temps are pretty mild.  It will work perfectly.  I'd rate it as medium weight, neither too warm or inadequate for the task.  The extra stars go for fit and finish.  I typically order medium and this is a ""perfect"" medium in all areas.  I really like the snug cadet collar for cycling.  I was blown away by the little extra details:  zip pockets, which when open are adequately deep; plus deep pockets on the inside of the jacket.  This is a super useful, well-designed piece of clothing.  While I don't need another, I may buy a second color."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Unbeatable Price,4,"I was headed to Canada for an early fall trip and needed a light jacket with lightning fast shipping. This fit the bill and did not disappoint. You can rarely stumble into a thrift store and find outerwear at this price, and certainly not with an accurate fit and 2 day shipping.This is definitely not a quality item, but it gets the job done. It's fairly thin but comfortable and soft.As I said, not a quality item. I wore it today and got home and found a small hole at the sleeve. I've washed it only once and the return period just ended YESTERDAY, I've worn it maybe 6 times total. But am I mad? No - the item did its job, and will be a great beater jacket. For folks who would normally go to discount retailers, this is about as good and costs way less.So whether you plan to rely on this as a main jacket, or you're just in a bind like I was, you ought to be satisfied that you're getting exactly what you paid for, albeit still cheaper than any retail imaginable."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Nice,5,"I'm a woman tired of womens form fitting, whimpy quality jackets.  I wanted a relaxed, clean line, cozy fit. This is perfect. A little long in the sleeves but I just turn them back-a plus when the steering wheel is cold and I have no gloves, the extra length is there. I probably could have gone down a size but love having plenty of room to layer. I may come back for another color."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Good quality but it’s no Columbia/NorthFace,3,This fleece jacket is nice and fits slightly larger then the size picked. I got a medium and the actual size is between med and large. Not bad and it works but the stomach area is a little larger then a true medium. The arms and collar are correct for a medium size jacket. The jacket is of good quality though a bit thinner then a high priced fleece jacket. This is above a Walmart type brand but slightly below a Columbia or North Face jacket. For the price it is a good choice just don’t expect it to be super warm but great to have on a cooler day. If you later it with another decent long sleeve shirt you should be fine.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Nice fleece jacket for indoors but not adequate by itself for colder climates,4,"This fleece jacket fits well (Men, small) and looks great with a nice texture and adequate warmth for around the house.  Nice to get a good fit and selection as most men's clothing is more suited for bigger people.For our cooler weather, it is not adequate by itself for outerwear as the fleece is not thick enough.  However, it can be used as a layer.  Have not washed it yet but it seems durable with the possible exception of the sleeve which seems to be the first place I show wear.  Hope it does not pell with washing but the price is reasonable...so no great expectations.  This product is recommended for good styling, adequate warmth indoor, and great value."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Long sleeves, cozy, comfortable",5,"I ordered and hoped it would run large for me, a woman, wearing a man's cozy, fleece jacket. The sleeves are wonderfully long enough, and it's perfect for layering! I love it. The pockets are zip, and deeply angled so things shouldn't fall out easily if left unzipped. It's perfect for a tall, chubby, woman😍👌! And it washed well. Might need the red Buffalo check jacket as well.🐃☑️❤️"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Seems fine, size XL",4,"I got a size XL, I'm 6'1 and 255, with a fairly long torso and a big chest. Fits pretty much like a glove. I could maybe use another inch or two in length, but like I said, long torso. Could definitely use another inch in the sleeves, and my arms are closer to proportional. When zipped all the way up, my thick neck fits inside. It's a little tight, but gets a passing grade, when lots of jackets I've had in the past have failed. The material is soft and comfy, if clearly made to a budget. You get what you pay for. Love the color.I had to return the first jacket that I got (this exact same one) because somehow the front of the jacket right over the zipper got melted some time after the plastic wrap was put on it. The plastic wrap it came in was actually melted to the front. Recommend looking over your jacket when you get it. I've rarely ever had to return Amazon stuff for being faulty, and I was impressed by how easy it was. Top mark for Amazon service, there.One nice surprise (and you really don't expect nice surprises on a 20 dollar jacket) are the two interior pockets. They're the deep kind on either side of the zipper, just about the perfect size for a standard paperback book. I've always liked those in previous jackets I've owned, but I definitely didn't expect them in this one, and there's no mention of them in the literature. Nice.4/5 overall."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great buy. Very comfy. Love this.,5,"This is perhaps the most comfortable thing I have worn in ages. I really am so happy that I got this. Very comfortable. I’m 5’11, about 195 and the Large fits perfect"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,No chest pocket but otherwise nice warm and comfortable. A bit longer that usual though.,4,"single layer fabric on the thicker side. works ok. The two or three things I do not like. First one I ordered that I normally use XL, it was too large so I ordered L. That fits nicely. No breast/chest pocket on this jacket, the jacket is a bit longer than the North Face Apex fleece jackets. I have to put my phone in the regular pockets and it gets in the way when I have to drive in my car. The only other thing that has not causes a problem but is missing from this jacket is the little fabric flap on name brand jacket that protect your chin from a cold zipper. Otherwise this jacket is really nice an warm and breathable, keeps you dry and warm. Good for indoors, and outdoors, and as a layer. I bought this for work because at we are not allowed Logos of other companies, and it is going to take a while to order and receive my employer's branded jackets."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Awesome fleece,5,"This fleece jacket is awesome!! I love it. It fits perfect. It's soft and VERY comfortable. It is lighter weight than my Columbia fleece which makes it perfect for when it's not real cold. I was skeptical when I bought it because the price was so low. When it arrived I tried it on and was very pleasantly surprised. I absolutely love it. So much that I bought 3 more of them. Another color for me, one for my wife and one for my Son. I think I will be buying more of them too. In different colors. LOVE the fleece jacket !!!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Awkwardly long, horrible feeling fabric in the pockets.",2,"I bought this jacket as a “freezer coat” for my job where I have to frequently go into a walk-in. This thing is huge and awkwardly proportioned. The length is very long, it’s tight around the bottom edge and cuff of the sleeve. I’m a woman and expected it to be a bit baggy, but it’s much larger than the other men’s hoodies and jackets I’ve worn before. It is warm and definitely thicker material than a woman’s jacket, which is why I purchased a men’s. THE WORST PART THOUGH is that the pockets are lined with that awful material that snags every hangnail and rough patch of skin on your hands. So when you slide your hands into the pockets it feels AWFUL. I literally dread using the pockets."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Excellent Fleece Jacket!,5,"One of my better purchases lately. This is a very comfortable jacket. The only reason I rated it ""A little loose fitting"" is that's how I like jackets and sweaters. I'm somewhere between large and extra large for clothes so always go a little bigger in sizes. I washed the sweater and full dried it at regular hot settings to purposely shrink it down just a bit, which it did just a bit. The fact that it only shrank down a very small bit to me confirms its high quality. Plus, washing it did not change the color at all. You can't go wrong with this jacket, especially at just $20."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Nothing Stays the Same,4,"Have bought 3 previous Amazon Essentials zip fleece (i.e. this exact model just different colors) jackets over a couple years. Each successive item has been a reduction in quality. This latest item is lighter in weight of material, tighter in fit (all tagged as men's xl) and shorter in sleeve length - no reduction in price. Looks to me like a case of cheapen the product to increase the profit. This will be my last purchase of this item from Amazon.  Jerry"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Kind of live this fleece sweater /jacket,5,This is a really nice fleece sweater. Keeps warm and fit just right. Even though what bothers me is that it kind of sticks to my clothes when taking it off as an undergarment for my jacket I understand it is fleece and not lined with a smooth surface. So I will still give it 5 stars because it is perfect around the house too on these cold days. Can jump outside quick and no need to grab a jacket because it warms right back up.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,A Few Comments Good And Bad,3,"This item is an incredible deal and has a good fit. The fabric is good. LLBean sells an item close to this for $80.00 . But my concern is that over the course of a fairly short time, the sewing has unraveled on the side of the jacket and on one of the sleeves. Luckily we have a sewing machine and I was able to repair it. Still this should not happen and I have to wonder if this is a problem across the board with this product or if i just got unlucky."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Just arrived. Looks and feels like a smart purchase.,5,"I was tired of being cold overnight (I work a lot of overnights, inside) and at times during the day. I wanted a fleece jacket yet financially could not really afford buying from the big brands and paying $40-100. I found this product and the reviews, colors and price grabbed me. I took the plunge. I have owned it for just a day so keep that in mind -- I am satisfied.The garment is light yet warmed me up right away when I finally put it on. Later that evening, not feeling well, I went to lie down in a bedroom and I felt cold so not sure exactly how warm it is until I own it longer. The jacket looks good. Happy with that. It is comfortable. It is ""warming."" All aces in those categories.I have not worked out for a few years so I have lost weight and muscle thus I decided to buy a small, which normally fits me fairly well. The jacket fits yet it is a tighter (not too tight) fit. Not too tight that I want to return it. I bring this up for one reason. If you're a ""tweener"" size like me, right on the edge of two sizes, then you might want to pick the next higher size to have the ""ideal"" fit if you like a more relaxed, roomy fit. If I had to do it all over again or if I buy this jacket again, I'd buy the next size up."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great Product!,4,"What gives?  Amazon Essentials comes through again.  Why don't other sources offer such good quality and features at reasonable prices?  Anyway, the shirt/jacket is wonderful:  warm, soft, very good quality.  I can only fault one thing really.  The Amazon page shows a guy taller than I am wearing a medium.  Not true.  I ordered large when I normally order XL for comfortable fit.  Shirt just a bit tight but have lost weight and now fits nicely.  Quality is the big surprise.  I did not expect such attention to detail and finish from a product so reasonably priced.  Have since bought another one."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,SO FAR SO GOOD,4,"I like this product because it has a good fit and surprisingly makes you look as good as possible (i.e. thin).The jacket is actually quite stylish. The fleece is soft and medium weight. Probably comfortable for most people down to 50 to 55 degrees. Despite what others reviews have said, I have not had any problems with the zippers. They seem fine. There are no logos on the  fleece sweater which is also a plus. I bought a black fleece jacket and it goes well with almost anything-from t shirts to dress shirts.All in all this seems like a good buy for the price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Not north face but a good budget buy,5,"For the price: A very nice fleece. Definitely doesn't hold a candle to any comulbia or north face, but does the job just fine. Not a huge fan of the stitching and edges. The armholes are thin, and look cheap. There than that pretty similar to the other fleeces on the market in appearance, with a lot more visible stitching on the exterior (you can see the stitching for the tag and there is a line down the middle of the back)."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,This is a fantastic value for the money!,5,"I'm not sure I have written a review on Amazon before but felt compelled to write on for this fleece. When you see such an incredible price (especially on Prime day) coupled with the fact that there are so many 5 star reviews, you are compelled to see what the fuss is all about. And i have to say, this fleece does not disappoint!When you take it out of the bag, it looks like any other ordinary fleece, but when you try it on, it all makes sense as to why it received such high reviews:1. This is a very warm fleece. Do not let the lightness (weight) fool you! I've been using this during October in New England and so, right now the temperature hovers around 60ish degrees. This jacket is very warm. so much so that i get hot in it so i suspect it will do quite well as the temperature gets cooler. I would not recommend only this for winter, but it will do quite nicely layered.2. This is a great fitting fleece. I am 5'6, 140ish and closer to a slim fit and the XS sized fleece fits like a glove! I've always had trouble finding items that fit me. The closest is Uniqlo with their extra small, but their sleeves and length are rather short. This one has the perfect sleeve length as well as jacket length.3. The price. i mentioned this earlier but its worth mentioning again. I've also purchased a north face fleece and while that one is certainly thicker, in terms of warmth, this is only a little bit less warm. So the value for this fleece is incredible.All in all, I am very happy with it. I ordered one for my father and he was quite surprised and impressed with quality relative to the price. Nice job Amazon!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Well constructed but a bit smaller than everyone elses XL,3,"I bought and received the Navy Blue Fleece Jacket size XL.  It is a fairly heavy weight fabric so the description 'Polar' is correct.  It appears to be well constructed, it hasn't fallen apart with the first wash.  I have other fleece jackets and this one fits tighter in the chest and arms more than any of the others brands I have.  As long as I have nothing more than a t-shirt on under it I should be ok.  This is something I'll just wear around the house in the winter."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Runs a Little Large,4,"Yes, they run large. I ordered three (3) in different colors and they all were much larger than other similar fleece jackets I've purchased.Material is a good weight, seams are tight, zipper seems of good quality.Solid colors are good, but those with patterns are loosing their newness quickly, noticeable after just one washing.Also to note, the sleeves and bottom are not elasticized in any way as is the norm from other suppliers."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Great price!  Nice and warm, with ZIPPERED side pockets!!",5,"Nice quality fleece jacket at a great price.  I was looking for a jacket with zippered pockets and this is the only one that was the closest to the Vantage jacket I had, just to wear at home. I ordered a men’s size small. It is nice and warm.  The sleeves are a bit long and the overall jacket also a bit long but expected as this is a men’s jacket.  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and might buy another one to keep as a backup when this one is in the wash!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,If only...,4,"Nice full zippered fleece! I would consider this medium weight and would provide good warmth when layered. Color is a very pleasant light grey heather. Zipper and pocket zippers work nicely.Shoulder, chest and arm fits as expected. Overall length was just too long for me. To bad, it's a super nice fleece worth the money, everything fits but length. I measured this against another fleece (Old Navy) that fits me well and thisAmazon Essential fleece is a good 2 inches longer.  Depending on how choosy you are regarding fit, this fleece may be for you.Just for reference, I wear a 38/39 short sports jacket, this fleece fit me like a 38/39 regular and almost bordering on long..."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Good jacket,4,"Jacket fits well for my size (2XL) and is very warm.  Temp outside is in the 20's and windy but this jacket works fine.  I much prefer a lighter jacket as compared to big bulky winter coats and this jacket is doing the job so far.  No complaints or issues so far (been a few months).  The only knock on it is the collar, it is more of a pop collar that stays up and is annoying on my neck (would prefer it stays down).  Not the worst thing in the world but worth mentioning."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Good performance, nice looks",5,"After accidentally forgetting my Columbia Steen Mountain fleece on an airplane, I bought this to replace it. It is warm, fits slim enough to wear under a soft shell jacket, looks nice, has huge inside pockets, the collar can be folded up to protect your neck, and has long enough sleeves and torso for me (6'2"" male, I got a medium). One minor gripe I had about the Columbia was that on the inside of the fleece where the Columbia logo was, there was white backing that you could see when the it was not zipped up. This fleece does not have that problem."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Have bought 3!,5,"I love a lightweight/comfortable coat and I decided to order one of the Amazon Essentials coats earlier this month. The coat arrived and it fit great, was warm enough for a Vegas winter, and had zipper pockets! I repeat, the pockets are zippered! This is HUGE for me when I don't want to carry a bag with me to a concert or when walking around. I loved it so much, I've ordered two more! These coats hold up well in the wash (don't shrink), and are able to be worn multiple times without needing to be washed in between. I have ordered similar coats for twice the money and I would recommend this Amazon coat over the other brands 10 times out of 10. I will likely order more colors/designs. My favorite one I have so far is the blue pattern."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Decent but beware of sizing.,3,Amazing quality for only $20. Very soft and smooth unlike some fleece items. Don't be fooled by the Amazon photo of someone 6' and medium build wearing a size Medium. I should have just stuck with Large but tried the Medium not wanting an overly baggy fit. Well it is really just a bit tight - should have tried the Large but the quality is nice with details well sewn. Just be careful of the sizing.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Pleasantly surprised. Warm and fits good.,5,"For the price and function, I must say, that I am pleasantly surprised. I’ve been rocking it for close to a week straight ah m and it has kept me warm in temperatures in the 20’s-30s with no problem.I purchased it to wear it exclusively UBER a really light quilted puff jacket and I am very happy and warm. It’s more then adequate. I even worn it with only at shirt under to do some chores in my yard and it kept me warm.I’m yet to experience the fuzz balls that others are talking about. If and when it happens. It’s okay. What else more can I expect from an inexpensive fleece that’s really warm?But it. You won’t regret it!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,great fleece,4,I always buy a new Columbia fleece every year. This year I waited too long to get the good deals around the holidays. After looking in the stores there were no deals left since summer clothes are on the shelves. I saw this Amazon Essentials Jacket . I been reading good reviews on the brand in general. When getting this jacket i was afraid it would be real thin compared to he Columbia brand. I was not disappointed on the thickness. It feels just as thick as my older Columbia jacket. This jacket has nice deep pockets. I do not have to worry about my phone or glasses slipping out when sitting in a recliner position. My normal size would be a XL but I like to have a loos fitting jacket so I ordered a XXL. The fit is perfect for me. Not to large and not tight. I have had this jacket for a week and have worn it everyday. So far its been a great jacket. I would recommend to anyone.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Not too many cons on this one,5,This fleece has solid warmth. It’s one of those garments you have to be careful wearing out when it’s not quite chilly bc you’ll develop a sweat while walking or what have you. It has become my go to as it’s pretty sleek looking zipped up. I’m 6’ 235lbs muscular build and it has a very slight oversized fit look in XL. I think I returned the Large that I got though bc it fit a little snug looking. Fantastic product though. Feel it’ll last me 20 years
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Perfect at home winter season comfort clothing,5,"Love it. I’m working from home, winter’s approaching, and needed something comfortable enough to beat around in but also not too shabby to run errands in, and this is perfect for just that. I’m 5’8 150lbs, and it fits perfect... snug but not tight. I’ll be ordering more, and wearing often."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Even Women can wear this.,5,OMG this is so warm I been wearing it all the time. Been wearing it under my work clothes because my bus is very cold first thing in the morning. Perfect fit. I love it so much I ordered one for my husband . I know this is a Men's Fleece but I like the way they fit compare to a Women's Fleece
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Nice but sizing is too big,4,"I like the look and feel of this fleece jacket. My only complaint is the size, which is why I took a star off. It was just too big for me. Instead of returning it I gave it to my dad. He seems to like it and it fits him well.I would order a size down."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,I bought the Large.,5,"I normally dress in neutral single colors, but I felt like giving this fleece a go because it catches the eye with its simplicity and classic patterns. I do not know what you think the texture or comfort of this fleece will be so I will clarify your question.- It feels like you are wearing a blanket from your grandmother's house.I truly feel comfortable in it. I have two other fleeces, one is too thin the other one is too stiff. This one wears just right.my measurements16"" neck, zipped up it feels snug36"" waist. My ""dad-bod"" is not protruding44: shoulders. And they are complimented with a hint of sharp edgingI have received compliments from strangers asking where I got it and my wife says I look like a human quilt. I think that is also a compliment.This is my favorite fleece, I hope it helps. I conclude my show-and-tell for the day."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,OK,3,"This is not the fleece you may be used to from the past, but then again, what is? It's really just OK and doesn't have the feel of something that will last very long, but I'm 65 so the same might be said about me, too. Anyway, so far so good, but I miss the beefy fleece of my youth."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Oversized or mislabeled,4,"Excellent materials and tailoring; comfortable to wear.  Garment and packaging both labeled ""Medium"".  Medium  jacket fits my chest and shoulder width, normally extends to about halfway between waist and tailbone, and may be just a little short in sleeves.  This fleece jacket is loose around chest and shoulders, but OK, extends down to tailbone, and sleeves could cover parts of my hands.  Intended use is as intermediate layer for outside exercise, so size is not critical.  Won't find much other use."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Good Basic Light Fleece,5,"I have a plethora of fleeces and my husband had none.  Sweet wife asked husband if he would like a fleece and he said ""No, I don't need one.""  So, I ordered him this inexpensive fleece and he loves it.  I knew he would.He is 5'9"" and weighs about 180.  Firmly built.  He usually wears a large in shirts and jackets.  This jacket fits just right.  It is a little on the short side, but so is my husband.  I noticed that in the picture before I ordered and thought it would be okay.  It is.Zipper outer pockets and no other frills.  Just the basic lighter weight fleece jacket.All is good."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Not for shorter guys,3,"This is a well-made product. The material is substantial in weight without being too bulky. Tailoring is nice and neat, The only issue for me was the jacket's body and sleeve length. I bought a medium to fit my 5'7"", 160 lb. frame and the bottom of the jacket was below my crotch; the sleeves more than 3"" too long as well. I have several Columbia fleece jackets in medium and even though sizing is a moving target from year to year with that company, every one of those jackets is at least 2"" shorter than Amazon's. I'm used to turning the sleeves under, but the Amazon jacket length is a stopper for me. Great for anyone 5'10"" and up."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Entirely too long,2,"I normally wear and XL, I ordered and XL and it was a bit snug. I could have lived with the snug part but it was extremely long. Come well below my waist line. Over all it just didn't fit / feel right. The quality was fine. The actually color was more gold than the picture indicates."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Good quality comfortable and reasonably priced.,5,"I bought two of these fleece jackets. They are really comfortable and have roomy zippered pockets on the outside. No more phone working its way out of coat pockets! There are two good-sized pockets on the inside, one each side of the zipper. I like them for wearing everyday, everywhere. The front zipper  is sturdy and easy to use even in the cold. The neck has a small stand-up collar which keeps the wind from whistling down into the jacket. This is a fine product."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Looks good,5,"I liked the red and black plaid one so much I got the black one within a week or so. I like pretty much everything about this jacket as it is comfortable and can be worn as an every day wear.  I like the cuffs because they aren't really gathered but not totally open either. I guess if I were to high lite one feature...for me would be the spacious inside pockets.This jacket can easily be worn under a heavier item or over a lighter item, very flexible."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Inferior Amazon Product that they will not stand behind - Broken,1,"I barely used the zippers and in month three of 1-2x weekly wear I decided to zip something in the left pocket. The zipper broke and was stuck in an upright position with my stuff stuck inside.I contacted Amazon support and was told by multiple support agents that since I did not report a broken zipper on day 1 of receiving the item or in the return window, that there was nothing they could do (even though they produce the product). So I had to take a scissors and cut around the pocket to get my things out. I now have a cheap jacket with a broken pocket and a hole cut into it.I'm really glad I didn't buy a Columbia or North Face and decided to spend less money here... On a thing that is now close to not even donate-able. Those companies stand by their products and I will now be spending the equivalent or more due to choosing an inferior Amazon made product."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,I'd like it more if I were a foot taller.,4,"The price and comfort are fine. Unfortunately, I hadn't noticed that the model was 6'2"" so instead of the jacket coming down to my waist, it comes down to my inseam. I wear an outer short jacket and layer, so it's not the look I was going for, BUT LISTEN UP, for about 20 bucks delivered the next day, it's fine. I just have to make sure I'm not buying the one size fits all clothing that really is one size fits big and tall men."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Functional jacket that is an excellent value.,5,This is my fourth Amazon fleece jacket replacing one that has been worn indoors and out for the last three years.  They are extremely useful: both as a jacket during mild cold weather and as a sweater worn beneath an outer coat in winter weather.  The weight is for me ideal neither too heavy or too light. The zip pockets make the jacket functional.  It is machine washable. I am 6'1'' and 165 lbs. Medium is a perfect fit.  The price makes it something of a bargain.  Highly recommend.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Nice and warm,5,"First time I have done a review of a Amazon Basics product.  Received  this product on time and was surprised at the quality for the price.  I am 6'4"" about 215 in weight and ordered a XXLarge which fits me just right.  The fleece has deep pockets on the outside and inside they open into the same pockets from that direction - interesting manner to keep your hands warm.  Quality is good so far as this jacket fleece has been received just about three weeks ago.  I have used it so far in 40 degree weather here in Palmdale California as for the first time we have had snow and rain the first time in over 8 year, not as bad as some parts of the rest of the nation.  I layer it with a barn style coat and we are good to go in the High Desert cold."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Comfortable and great value,5,"Great value! I'm 6'8"" and the sleeves and body are actually are long enough. The zip up pockets are nice. They're deep enough and keep the hands warm. There is a ""pouch"" on the inside but nothing to secure it closed. There is no liner but it is very soft. The collar stands up pretty well on it own. I haven't noticed any pilling or shedding. The cuffs and bottom of the jacket do not have a way to be tightened up. The fit is very good however and adjustments aren't really needed. I would recommend this and will buy another."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Excellent Value. Slight inconsistencies in Size.,5,AmazonBasic clothing has been great in my experience. I love these jackets and I’ve ordered 3. They seem to be comparable quality to my Columbia jackets but 1/2 or even 1/3 of the price. The only complaint I do have is sizing seems inconsistent. As I mentioned I have three jackets each of a different color. Each one fits a little differently but they’re all the same size. They aren’t so different that I can’t wear them but one in particular is much tighter than the other two. But overall I still definitely recommend them. Even if you have to buy three to get two that fit right you’re saving money compared to Columbia or North Face.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Terrific Amazon essentials jacket that really surprised me,5,I just got this jacket and I'm very impressed. I've bought three Amazon essentials products so far and this is another one that is terrific. It fits as expected and is very nice quality. I love the red plaid color I chose and it's very comfortable. The price was very affordable and the basics line is very fair in pricing. Amazon is offering great made clothing products without breaking the wallet. I can definitely recommend this. I'll be ordering more essentials products from now on.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Can't complain for the price, Medium fits 5'10""",5,"I really haven't worn it beyond trying it on for the coming cooler season, but wanted to report my sizing match-up for anyone else who scours the reviews for sizes close to them.I'm 5'10"", 183 lbs., and the Medium size seems to fit.  It is just a hair (half an inch?) long in the sleeves, and the belly area is larger than it needed to be for me, but I'm pretty sure a size 'Small' would be overly tight, short and too small.  I'm happy with it.  Bought this on a Black Friday sale, so really can't complain.  I'll update the review as I wear it, but for what it is, it seems fine."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great jacket,4,"I am female who likes these kinds of jackets with long enough sleves and ample room in sleve/chest area. The length is good for me, and  will cover the tops I wear underneat  and not tuck in.  A layered look has never appealed to me. This fits the bill nicely for me. Just realize, I am 5'7"" and weigh 130 lbs. My comments are in that context.Fabric was nice, zipper worked well, I like the navy color. I will put this on in the house when it it colder than expected in winter, or in fall and spring just to run out to do an erand etc. Fabric is not windproof or rain resistant, it is not intended for that. Finally, the price was great for the quality. Womens comperable would probably run more."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,The best you can get on the cheap,4,"I gave it 4 stars because it’s under $20 and you get what you pay for. What you’re paying for is a comparatively thin fleece jacket that’s slightly on the slim fit side, a bit long with long narrow sleeves. The sleeves will be difficult to slide over some shirt materials. The are very deep and the zippers are of decent quality. I wish the length was an inch or 2 shorter.  Overall it looks and fits reasonably well. For $20 you can’t go wrong. Glad Amazing is replacing the “Basics” label for “Essentials”. That sounds a lot less like “products for poor people”."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Nice quality, but not for serious warmth",4,"I ordered two of these for wear in the house during cool weather.  They are decent quality although not for serious warmth.  I’m 6’, 192# and the XL is a perfect fit.  I’m a little suspicious of the plastic zippers and hope  they will last a few seasons.  The deep twin pockets are nice.  Good buy for the price when you consider shipping is free."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Go with your regular size,4,"Just go with whatever size jacket or fleece you usually wear.  I’m 6’0 @ 175-180lbs and went with a size medium only because in this listing it says the model pictured was 6’2 @ 185lbs wearing a medium.  A medium was a bit too tight/fitted, especially with the fleece zipped up.  Exchanging this for a large, quality wise it’s great."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,very good looking and great fit. (one size up),4,"I like the appearance, do a lot of hiking in the woods, the red color stand out. Not real cold yet (central Mass.), but  I do believe it will be a winner in comfort and warmth. Not field tested yet, but will update  that in the future.."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Red Buffalo Pattern is great, very good buy",4,"I bought this for the red buffalo pattern.  The color is great, the price is great.  It is not very soft but that is not a critical issue.  Decent thickness to fabric overall.  Another great design feature I prefer is the pockets are not right at the side seam, they are set 3-4 inches closer to the front, and they have a zipper which is a big benefit.  A very good buy on first inspection but time will tell.  Others have commented on pilling and zipper issues.  Fingers crossed.  Happy I bought this."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,warm jacket that looks good,5,"I have the women's jacket and my husband has always liked it, even asked if he could wear it outside.  The arms were way too short for him.  Ordered the Men's jacket and he loved it; and he is PICKY.  Fit well, sleeves were perfect for his long arms, and the bottom was perfect for his narrow hind quarters.  So worth the money cause it is warm and blocks the wind"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Warm and soft,5,"I didn't realize how much warmer this would be than a hoodie sweatshirt. Not allowed hoodies at work and this is perfect for when I have to go into the commercial freezers at work. Large interior pockets plus large exterior pockets. Stretchy too. Sleeves long enough to pull over frozen fingers or to roll up as cuffs, and I have long arms."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,A really nice fleece,4,"This is a really nice fleece jacket. It's soft, warm, and very comfortable. It has nice deep pockets, and just the right amount of elastic at the wrists and waist. I would have given it 5 stars, but the sizing isn't consistent. I bought two of these (in black & ""charcoal heather""), both alleged to be the same size. One fits perfectly, the other is noticeably bigger."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,overpriced trash,1,"For the price, I expected something similar in quality to Walmart products. You might be asking why I just didn't get it from Walmart, it's because Walmart has nothing in stock and my local one is so ghetto they have to lock their socks behind glass panels. The cuffs are a joke, the stitching is fine, it will probably hold up for a year but the sewing pattern is the design of a 5 year old. My left pocket wasn't sewn properly and there is a gaping hole, just like the gaping hole in my wallet after realizing I paid $20+ for this. The fleece is pretty thin, I've purchased fleece from Jo-Ann fabrics before and it's thicker, warmer, softer and cheap. After Amazon pays their slaves in their factories, I'd say Amazon is making about 500% profit selling this item. No wonder Bezos is flying to space. The only good thing about this fleece jacket is that I can return it for free."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great value,4,"Medium fits well (somewhat snug) at 5'8"" and 173, 42 Chest. If you plan on putting stuff in the inside bellows pockets maybe move up a size otherwise it may look odd.  This is a simple poly fleece, not very thick but would make a good second layer over a base layer.  Also good for over a t-shirt in spring or fall when it is too cool out for just a shirt."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Great jacket, you should get more than one",5,I ordered this jacket for my man because he needed one.  He's worn it ever since it arrived and it fits him to a tee.  It's got extra pockets on the inside and the outside pockets are pretty deep too.  I just ordered him another one.  It's a good jacket to get him through Florida winter's.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,For any money...,5,"I shopped several local stores for a fleece jacket.  The fits, styles, and prices were disappointing.  I ordered this jacket on the off chance.  I am 5'10"" and weigh 175 lbs.  The large is perfect for me.  Fits well, but loose enough to be comfortable and to accommodate a sweater.  The fabric is not thin, cheap, but rather of medium weight I suppose it would be called.  I recovered the once-lost favorite jacket I bought this to replace, but I kept this one nevertheless.  Too swell not to.  And the price is unbelievable."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Don’t assume...,2,"We bought these on PRIME day as matching husband and wife fleece jackets to wear camping.  Unfortunately, it was too much to assume that the men’s amazon basic green and the women’s amazon basic green would match.  Nope, not even close.  As a stand-alone jacket, it is fine.  But the color-match isn’t just poor quality control or a separate batch or lot.  Totally.  Different. Color."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great Fit and extra warm,5,"Great Fit and extra warm.  For the price It can't be beat.  I was looking for comfort and just having a warm fleece with a full zipper, without spending for name brand.  This Fleece fits the bill.  Size was on the money correct.  Having a small belly it is large enough with the large size that it doesn't show your stomach sticking out with the other brand larges that I had to return.  Basically is a looser fit then the typical rock hard abs fit that most men don't have."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great mid layer and over all Jacket,5,I bought this for a mid layer for snowboarding. I needed pockets that zipped up because when your on the mountain the last thing you want is an open pocket with your wallet and keys flying out. The zipped up pockets worked as expected. Also there are two deep inner pockets in the jacket where I put my snowboard tool and lock. As a mid layer it kept me warm and dry. There are times when I'm just out and about in town and this is enough to keep me warm. Great product over all.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great Value,5,"This is a great value and looks pretty good and plain without any logos.  Thick/warm enough to wear outside for a quick dash in 40-50 degree temps and light enough to wear inside in a cooler office/home.  For only $20 you may as well get 2.  I got the 2X size and it fits my 5'9"" 240ish non pot-belly frame good.  Zipper on pockets are nice for storage, just hope they hold up well."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Excellent jacket for spring, fall and winter.",5,This jacket is really nice. It blocks most of the wind and keeps me warm. Even in the dead of winter I just use this and a light jacket to break the wind from getting in and I stay warm.The best part is I can use it in the upper 60s low 70s too and it won’t overheat me. It keeps the heat in when it’s cool without making me hot.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Good jacket, with a few shortcomings...",4,"I bought this for the pattern, and the warmth - and now that it's here, it meets my expectations in both of those aspects.  The cut of the jacket, however, is a little more ""classic fit"" - fits as expected in the chest and shoulders, but is  looser around the waist than I would like - and it also seems a bit odd that there aren't any kind of wrist cuffs.  Overall, though, I'm going to wear it, and I think it represents a good value."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Sizing way off and chemically residue & small,2,"Ran very small. I’m a female 2xl but ordered a men’s 2xl but I like fleece jackets to be more loose and comfortable. This jacket was so tight! The sizing was WAY off. The texture was also wrong, it had a vey course texture and chemically residue to touch and chemically smell to it. My husband is a comfortable men’s 2xl usually and it was too tight on him as well. All around fail with this one. Returned it right away."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Keeps you warm,5,"Well first off this is a Mens fleece jacket and I am a 5 foot 4 woman. I ordered an extra large because it's getting cold and I need something to wear outside when I go walking early in the morning. The material of the fleece is soft, durable, and breathable. It keeps me warm on those cold days. This is a great Buy. I probably will order more in other colors. If you're looking for a nice fleece jacket thats inexpensive then make sure you invest in this product."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Wonderful fleece jacket for the price!,5,"These are very well made. After ordering one, I ordered 4 more in different colors. Lightweight and warm. Zippered pockets are great. It fits true to size. It isn't a baggy fit or slim fit. It's just right and runs long enough for average men. I am not sure how this would fit with someone tall. The price is unbelievable compared to name brands."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"SUPER NICE JACKET, SUPER NICE PRICE!",5,"I ordered this men's jacket in size XXL for myself since the Women's size 2X that I normally wear was out of stock.  I am only 5'1"", so I expected the sleeves to be too long, but that is a very quick fix at my sewing machine.  Other than the sleeves, the jacket fit me perfectly, the fleece is great quality, and the garment is very well made. Now to hide it from my husband who wants one too now!  :-)  I am very satisfied with my purchase and I would highly recommend this nice basic camo fleece jacket for women and men!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Very comfortable; great value,4,"Got this as an extra layer to wear during the winter months. The material is very comfortable, and the fit is great (I'm 5'10"" and I purchased a medium). I like that the elastic around the wrists and waist is not too thick or tight--something that has bothered me about other brands of fleece jackets. My only complaint is that the openings for the outside pockets don't go down close enough to the waist of the jacket. It makes it awkward to tuck your hands in them. But overall, a nice, simple fleece jacket for the price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,very nice jacket,5,"I can't think of a single thing that I dislike about this jacket. It is very comfortable and is surprisingly warm for it's light weight. I wouldn't wear it on a sub-zero winter day, but for a cool (30's to 40's) day it is very adequate. For a nice jacket, you sure can't beat this price. I'm kind of a big guy and need at least an XL for shirts and jackets. This XL jacket fits me perfectly."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Mid-weight and nice looking enough for casual work days,5,"I bought this fleece to wear under a packable down jacket when the temperature is between 20 and 30 degrees Fahrenheit. I like that I can take the down jacket off and leave this on over a short sleeve shirt at work when the office is cold. I think my thermal hoodies are too casual for this purpose. I would say this is a mid to heavyweight fleece. It's not as light and thin as the other ones I own, which is nice. I also like having a full zipper so that I can wear it alone as a jacket and put it on and take it off without messing up my hair. It also has a nice large inner pocket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,that tag....,2,"basic fleece Zip Jacket- but,  Amazon Essentials' tags are hands down the most uncomfortable part of their clothing line. It will scratch and rub against your neck until you realize you MUST cut it out -- and that's when you realize Amazon  *really* sewed that thing in there. While not unfamiliar with using a seam ripper this still resulted in an accidental cut through the collar. But, if I had to decide to do it again, I still would - the tag is really that scratchy. This seems like a simple-ish problem to fix from a production standpoint, I hope Amazon does."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Good, but one annoying detail about the inside pockets",4,"A great value fleece, on par with a similar Columbia fleece I own. As other have stated, it’s a little thicker and warmer than one might expect. I have not had the shedding issue that others have reported.On to my headline, this is the only jacket I have ever come across where the inside pocket fabric goes outside of the exterior pockets. Call it irrational, say it shouldn’t matter, but it BOTHERS me. It would have been 5 stars otherwise."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Amazon should receive no star,1,it was wet we I received the Fleece Jacket.  Just Terrible..........Will never buy it  again.Amazon should receive no star with their terrible customer service experience.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great fit,5,"I can't find anything wrong with this fleece. I am 5'9"" and weigh 155 lbs. I debated between the medium and the large and chose the medium, which was the right decision. The sleeves and length are perfect. It is warm and comfortable. It isn't too thin and the zipper seems to be good quality. For $20 this was a great purchase."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,better than Eddie Bauer,5,I was afraid this might feel cheap.  to the contrary - I think the trim and finish is better than Eddie Bauer (which is my usual fleece brand).it's also nice and heavyweight compare to most other fleecesa very pleasant surprise.  will definitely try other AmazonEssentials in the future.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,I have bought two of these and I like them both.  But...,4,Color for the Navy is not Navy.  It's reflex blue.  Which has more red in it than blue and black.  If you ever deal with color you know what adding red to blue means.  Purple.  If you like purple then buy the navy blue.  If not get black.I still wear it on fishing trips but Im not a purple kind of guy.  Comfortable and warm.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Awesomely surprised fleece jacket,5,"And quite happy with this fleece zipup.  The way I have always imagined a hoodie or a zip-up should be made in my pinion around the colours for your wrist And that 2"" piece of retardedness  That hangs off the bottom of hoodies in zipups  Is annoying as f*** and I hate it. But this fleece jacket is made perfect I love it and I am going to buy more it fits me perfect looks good 5 star."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Looks cheap.,1,Overall it's a little small. The sleeves are very small which makes it tough to put on over anything. Plus the sleeves don't have elastic at the bottom so when you finally get done adjusting them over your shirt they just hang there. The fleece is very light....lighter than any fleece I've ever had and like my wife says it just looks cheap.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great jacket and reasonably priced,5,This jacket fits true to size and it really comfortable. I saw another review that said that the stitching in the pocket was just a couple of stitches and that it came apart right away so they were just kind of flapping around. I ordered the navy blue and the pockets are stitched all the way around except for the top. So its like interior pockets. I've pulled on this several times and I don't see them coming apart. I'll be ordering this jacket in other colors!
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,It's like stealing,5,"This is a terrific jacket and, for the price, it's an unbelievable value.  Nice, beefy fleece, well finished, solid construction and all for a ridiculously low price.  It is a really great deal.  I may have to buy another one.Sizing is generous - I bought an XL initially, but it was too big.  Returned that for a large, which is a perfect fit - very similar to Mountain Hardwear's sizing.  The sleeves are long enough - I wear a 35"" shirt sleeve and they're perfect.  Very happy with this jacket; for the price it is a phenomenal value."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,I love this fleece jacket.,5,"I ordered the black first, just to see how it would fit and feel, and it was perfect.  I order the red one, but it was a bit too big, so I sold it to a co-worker and reordered in a smaller size and it arrived and fit perfectly.  It also was that red color I love.  I was expecting it to be a dull red or some other red, but not red-red and it was.  So I love them both, the black and the red and they are very warm as well."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Good quality garment--accurate sizing,5,Medium weight fleece. Purchased size Large and fit is accurate.  Nice features of large zipped pockets and 2 large inner pockets.  Plan to order again in other colors.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Order one size larger -- no way was this a 2x,3,"I like plenty of shoulder room, larger arm size, so I often purchase men's sweatshirts and fleece.  There is NO WAY this was a 2X -- maybe a slim fit??  For those of you who want a trim sports fit, you'll like this jacket.For me? the entire POINT in my purchasing a men's 2X was for it to be roomy on me. I knew right out of the box it was at least one size too small for me and would not even close in the front.BUY UP ONE SIZE IN PLUS SIZES"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Problems with zipper and color.,3,"I liked the first jacket color we received, except the zipper was defective and had to return.  The replacement came in within two days of the complaint , however, it wasn't the color ordered.  But, can't be bothered to return.  The second jacket zipper was good and the overall appearance was well worth the money, but disappointed in the color not being correct."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Lightweight, comfortable fit, soft!",5,"Honestly, this is much better made that I imagine it would be. I’ve got a moderate to large frame for 5’8 and this fits perfectly, not too snug with a large size.It’s a bit thin, so in the cold weather it’s great for layer. Works best for fall/spring weather (~50-70 F)Overall I’m happy with the purchase"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Everything was great except for the ""cut""",3,"The fabric, seams, zipper, etc. all seemed good.  But I did not like the cut of the jacket.  Compared to other fleece jackets I have owned, this one was not tapered around the waist.  It makes it feel like you are wearing a trash bag - something that just hangs straight down and is not shaped at all."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Useless Pockets,3,"Bought this fleece so that I'd have a pocket for my medium sized smartphone. Chest pocket is too small and inner pockets are a good shape but have open corners on the bottom through which the phone falls out. Had to sew these shut to make the pockets functional. Unfortunately, due to the thinness of the material, there is no way to hide the stitching, kind or ruins the look of the jacket. This is probably why the corners were left open in the first place.."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Nice fitting fleece jacket,5,"I have many fleece jacket and by far this one fits me the best. I wear 17.5"" neck size shirt. This fleece jacket is slightly tight around my neck but is acceptable. The sleeve is like 34"" long but it does not bother me much even thought it is two inches longer than what I normally wear. The extra material rest at my wrist comfortably. Will consider buying one in another color."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Pretty good for $15,5,"I was going to give the a 4-star rating due to the price (I paid around $15) because used to buy a very similar jacket at Walmart for $10, but in reality this IS a slightly better product, and inherently things cost more and more every year. I feel like I got my money’s worth. I’ve seen this product go up to $20 or more since I bought mine, at that price I would invest a little more money and get a higher end product"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Pattern didn't match across the zipper,2,"I bought three of these jackets, in three different patterns, as gifts. Fit was great and the weight was nice but the patterns on brownish geometric and the blue stripe jackets didn't match up well across the zipper. They matched at the top of the zipper but were off by about 3/4"" by the bottom... since you have to zip from the bottom up, it was pretty noticeable! I returned 2 out of three. (Red and back check was great!)"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great fleece for the price,5,Jacket fit a lot better than expected. Color looks as the picture does. Pretty decent quality for the price. Will definitely be getting a few more in different colors. Definitely keeps you warm in this fall weather.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,nice but runs large,4,"I like it, but if you want it to fit like the picture, double check the size chart - they run larger than usual. I usually wear medium shirts and jackets, but sized down to a small with this, and I'm glad i did.but it feels good, looks good, zips easily - i hope it lasts a while - i like it"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Beautiful, but nearly too large and too warm.",4,"I essentially wanted a hoodless hoodie. This is a beautiful product, but it's a larger, looser, warmer fit than I expected. Will be great for cool mornings that don't need a hoodie, but too hot for wearing like a pajama top around the house. It's also not NEARLY as form-fitting as the photo."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"I am an Extra Medium, so it is hard to find garments that fit properly.",5,"This fits as well as can be expected, especially for the Prime Days 14.99 price tag.  Feels like it will be nice and warm when it finally gets cold in this Super Southern USA climate...  Of course, below 70F, I start to shiver like a little b****... so ... take that with a grain of salt.  It is definitely on par with most other fleeces i have bought.  So, buy with confidence."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Needs to go back to the drawing board.,1,"Nice jacket.Nice fabric.Size ordered was XL as I am a 6'2"" 230# man. Generally XL does it for me.This jacket fits like a large. In addition the seams arenot smooth and when you slide your hand into the sleeve you get scuffed.This product is what i would have expected to buy 30 years ago, not today."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Keep up the good work, Amazon Basics!",5,"I have purchased dozens of these jackets, one for myself and many more for our church that gives clothing to the needy. It seems that they are always in need of men’s jackets. I feel privileged to be able to donate such a high quality, warm jacket. I think they’re terrific! Nicely done, Amazon Basics!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Functions as expected.,4,"I bought two, XL and XXL. One for a shirt underneath (average wear) and one to put thermal and T-shirt underneath wear. Both fit normal. I like clothing a touch loose. However (this is a preference that I like) the end of the sleaves and the bottom of the jacket are straight fitted, meaning they're not elastic (sleaves) or have a way to sinch the bottom closed for wind resistance. I also have Columbia and it has these features. Lastly the Columbia feels and appears to be just a bit thicker - but the Columbia is more money. Amazon Essentials is a very good product and does as expected. If you're on a budget and every penny counts, this product works well."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,I hated this fleece with a passion...,3,"and you wanna know why? Because of that LABEL sewn with what seems to be a 3 ton sewing machine! This label scratches at my neck like there is no tomorrow. And the worse part if that the Amazon label is almost impossible to remove due to the sewing.Update: my wife finally got the label out and the jacket is a lot more comfortable, it's still very frustrating to have to do this with a new jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Perfect dad-jacket,5,"This is a great in the house or short trip to the convenience store dad-jacket. Cozy and lightweight, just right for a chilly day or walk around the block in the cold. Wish they had larger sizes for those that REALLY lean into the dad-bod but even while a bit snug for me, I still like this one."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Good product, great price.",5,"The jacket is a perfect fit for my use.  That means I can wear a sweater under the jacket.  I was really unsure of the right size because of many reviews, but I took a chance and got a large.  I am 5 foot 9 or 10 inches about 180 pounds and I guessed right on the size.Looks great, fits great."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great quality jackets,5,I bought this to wear at my job since we had to wear only zipper collared jackets this nice jackets was much cheaper to buy than buying one from the company I work for the jackets fit perfectly and was made very well even washed well!!Would definitely recommend buying this jacket.. wish they offered more colors I would for sure order again.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,More than worth the price.,5,"Great fleece especially for the price. Perfect for wearing by itself in chilly weather, or layering under a heavier coat in the cold. Has an inside pocket. Two outside pockets, nice and deep with zipper closures. Going to pick up another one in a different color. Fast delivery. Great purchase."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Runs small661,3,"It is nice, but too small. Unfortunately, they removed and tossed tags and packages before wrapping, and now can't be returned. He wears a Large/Extra large, but this fleece won't zip. Too bad, it's really nice otherwise. I bought one two years ago for another family member, and it fit and they loved it. I'm not sure what happened this time."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Quality and Style,5,This fleece jacket is well deigned and produced.  I like the color combination and the textural variation provided by the blue patches.  The zippers on all pockets are also much appreciated.  Nothing can bounce out and get lost during a jog or run.  An excellent product for the price.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,An outstanding value!,5,"This is a fantastic jacket for the price. The fleece is a little heavy but warm. The zipper and zip-up pockets are sturdy, and the light brown color is true to what’s depicted and looks great. It’s just a tiny bit snug around my waist, but in all other respects it fits perfectly."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Overall good, could use one improvement, one weird problem",4,"Overall very good for a light jacket, which is what i wanted. Low cost great too.Two items;1) a chest pocket for a cell phone would be a be a Great addition2) the inside pockets actually overlay the outside pockets. Ie: if you have anything in the inside pockets, and then you use the outside pockets, the items in the inside pockets feel like they are on the outside of the outside pockets."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Warmer than expected,4,"Did not expect it to be such a warm jacket. Nicely made. Size is generous. Too heavy for lounging around the house. This is an outdoor garment for temperatures down to freezing or maybe into the 20s, depending on what's worn under it. Seems nicely made. Washed it with cold water and it turned out great."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,A Very Nice Jacket For The Money!! Love!!,5,"I purchased this camo jacket for my 23 year old son in a large. He loved it and the large fit perfect!!! It is a good looking jacket with the thin trim around the bottom and around the cuffs. It is supposed to fit close and snug as to show off the male physique so if you want it a little big and loose then go up a size. It fits true to size. The camo is a nice looking jacket. I had ordered my boyfriend one in another color and it fits great too , but he loved the camo also and wants one now!! 😄"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Fit as expected, zippered pockets seem sturdy. Hubby likes",4,"Bought for hubby. 5’9” 208 lbs, 36/38 waist. Fits well. Zippered pockets. Feels a little icky (like chemicalish) but I’m very picky tactile person so for most people prob. a non issue. We wanted inexpensive/warm. I’ll update on warmth when we get back from Pacific NW."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Size runs BIG!,4,"Decent jacket. I am normally a XXL when it comes to jackets. This one is large on me. I wish I would have gotten an XL. I am a big guy. 6’1” and 240 lbs and the XXL is big on me. For the price, I can’t complain. Cheap enough I’ll ride the size out instead of going through the hassle of sending it back."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Not pear shaped, like most.",5,"For the price, this jacket is great! For once, an Amazon product that fits my shoulders and waist. I'm 5'10"", 160 and most of the clothes that fit my shoulders are super baggie around the waste, including Amazon's puffy jacket.  But this thing fits great and it's really soft."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Good Value & Quality,5,"I have bought two of these jackets over the last year. The second seems to be of higher quality than the first. They have also solved the open inside pocket issue; on my second jacket, the inside pockets are sewed shut on the bottom and nothing falls out. I have also, had no pilling issues with either jacket. My first jacket was red and the second was grey; the second seems to made of slightly better fleece than the first. For $20, I was delighted with both the value and the quality."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,High Quality and Value,5,"Nice weight fleece - has two outer pockets with zippers and two good size inner pockets.  Cuffs are elastic, nicely hemmed and should wear well.  Overall excellent value.  Only feature missing is a zippered chest pocket which is found on similar competitor items at twice or three times the price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Not particularly stylish, but well made and it keeps me warm.",3,"Good, useful jacket, though the styling is kind of ""old school."" I layered it over an undershirt and shirt, and under a down vest. Worked well for travelling (in December) from cold, cold New Mexico to warm (not hot) Baja Mexico. With the full zip, I could remove the down vest, unzip this jacket and get along fine in 75 degrees. But again, the style is pretty unexciting."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great sweater,5,"Sweater is much better than what I expected. 3 zipper closing pockets  make it even more desirable. and eliminate the chance of losing items by falling out. I couldn't ask for a better sweater, and at such a low price for such high quality. I highly recommend this product."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Warm and Comfy.,5,"The Fleece is soft and warm, just perfect for lounging about or wearing under a jacket for extra warmth.  I liked it so much, that I ordered a second one just to have as back-up."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great quality! Could pass as a coat!,5,"This fleece ALONE with no coat, has kept me toasty outside for multiple 7°f winter days! Quality is really impressive,  Amazon essentials has really shown itself to be a great brand,  from the stuff I've gotten from office chairs, to batteries,  to this. Well done,  Amazon."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Excellent Product!!!!! …,5,"I bought this for my Husband’s birthday … His other fleece jacket was falling apart! … He is never one to get rid of anything … but when he tried this on, he said, “Goodbye old fleece!!” … The quality and color (navy blue) and sizing is perfect!! … I’m sure I will be buying again!! … Highly recommend!!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Fit of this fleece,5,"I've been wearing Columbia brand fleeces like this Amazon one for years.  I'm right on the border between XL and XXL, and in the Columbia fleece I always wear an XXL and it fits fine.  This Amazon fleece in XXL (the size I ordered) was way too big for me, but other than sizing I have no complaints about this product and consider it an excellent value for its price.  I will certainly be re-ordering this in an XL size."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great value,5,"This jacket is a great value compared to the competition. It fits a little snug on me but that is exactly what I wanted since I ordered it in a smaller size. Although I just received it, I do not anticipate any issues. I like that it has zippered pockets."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Good Deal,5,Mid weight--a cross between a coat and a sweater.  Also order your size.  I ordered up a size assuming it would be tight but I was wrong to do so.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great value,5,"This is a fine quality fleece.  Priced at $17 or so, it is as good as North Face or Patagonia's mid/lighter weight fleece at a fraction of the price.  Of course, there's no ""brand"" logo, if that's your thing.  I do not aspire for more features in a fleece."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Nice jacket,5,This jacket is just right.  Nice fit. Warm. Inner pockets.  Zipped outer pockets.  It has replaced 3 of my other jackets having the combination of features.  Just be sure to get one size smaller as they run large.I'm very happy with this jacket.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Love it!,5,I fell in love with this style of jacket. For me it's perfect for an added layer when lounging and it works for quick trips outside. The zipper is nice and does not bother me or interfere. If i had one wish it would be the pockets did not have zippers however I can see the benefit of having this. Good value for the cost!
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Warm and comfy,5,Great jacket/sweater.  As to sizing: I read so many reviews that said these ran large that I ordered a size smaller than I usually get (XL).  I'd say it was accurately sized as large - not as big and boxy as many reviews said.  I'd suggest you buy your regular size.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Nice, but",4,"Very soft and comfortable material.  The inseam on a medium must be 31"" because  I'm a 32"" and they're just a bit short.Additionally,  it is leaving little black fur balls all over my house. I washed and dried before wearing and will wash again to see if it stops.  If not they go in the trash and the rating will drop accordingly."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,If you like your fit snug order a size down,2,I’m 6 foot and 180 lbs I wear my cloths kind of snug. That being said the item came and I was very excited since this is the first time I ordered an amazon basic item. The jacket it’s self is the quality you would expect for the price but it is way too big for a MEDIUM size. I feel like I’m drowning in fabric. I’ll going to suck it up and keep it and may give it to a family member but I was disappointed. If you like your fit snug order a size down.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Cozy warm and lightweight,5,My dtr in law loves this. She had taken over my son's identical fleece so needed one of her own. I had to order from the men's selection as the women's didn't have any colors that would make her happy. I got it a bit big and she says it's really. cozy.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Sometimes A Great Notion...,5,"I needed a light sweater, but couldn't find any that impressed me. Settled on this light, fleece jacket and all was resolved. I live in subtropical climate and there really is no need for a jacket. This worked for me. My current lady bug washed it and it looked even better!!!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,excellent product I like the way feels,4,"excellent product I like the way feels, it is nice and warm.  I had a stroke on my right side which cause it to be cold most of the time,  It does an excellent job of helping to keep it warm.  The only down side is that it is a little snug I could wish for a little larger for their  XX large or another larger size."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great quality and stylish for a great price,5,This is the second item of clothing I have purchased from the Amazon Essentials line. I have to admit to being a bit nervous that the jacket wouldn’t “fit” (I generally but XLT due to my height). Fits just fine! Great quality! You can’t beat the price.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Reasonably Warm and Fits Relatively Well,4,"I was pleasantly surprised by this jacket. Comfortable, warm, and fits reasonably well.  I wish the pocket openings were placed an inch or two lower as putting my hands in my the pockets can be a bit uncomfortable. I can see myself buying another in a different color."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Not That Great,3,"The overall build quality reminds me of a black they give out for free at a sporting event on maybe even on an airline.  This would be a solid purchase at $15, but for $20, you may as well spend $10 more and get a name brand garment or look around for a deal-  I just bought a Columbia fleece in a colour I'm not crazy about for $20.99 for example."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great jacket for the price,5,"Bought this for my husband to wear at the office, where he says it's always chilly. Pockets for throwing his phone in. No hood so it still looks professional enough. Not too heavy so it doesnt look like he's wearing a coat all day"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,sizing not good for typical American body,3,"Keeps body warm. For a 2X size chest is  too snug. Arm length way too long. Label says made in Vietnam. Perhaps they manufacture this item for the typical Vietnamese body. For $20.00 I'll keep it because most polar fleece is more expensive. Because of fit, I will not buy another."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Basic Fleece sweatshirt,3,"It’s a standard fleece, rather warm, but the zipper is kind of junk. I’ve only worn it for 3 days and the zipper has already separated at the bottom for me. Usually once this happens it keeps happening so I’m a bit discouraged. We’ll see i guess. I bought this to replace a sweater I got at target and wore everyday for 5 years and that zipper still works wonderfully.  I only had to replace it because the fabric was thin and getting holes. Too bad target doesn’t carry it anymore :("
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,RUNS SMALL - DID NOT FIT AS EXPECTED,3,"At 5""9"" and 175 lbs, I am not a large individual, however, have been a bodybuilder for over 30  of my short 50 years. With that said, I would highly recommend you order the next size up. Two if you have broad shoulders, full arms, fully developed back, and thick chest muscles. Aside from that, nice feel, texture and color. I will give this to my slim oldest Son at Christmas; the large I ordered should fit him perfectly."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Really happy with this purchase!,5,"I love the design, and how comfortable the jacket actually is. It’s light weight and really, really warm. Holds the heat in well.Like most people, I was hesitant because of the “Amazon brand”. Like, how good could these jackets actually be? I’m definitely going to buy more."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Short Sleeves,4,I have owned several Amazon fleeces and I've noticed this style's sleeves are about 4 inches shorter than my other ones. I have not washed it yet so I know it wasn't form shrinking. Everything else about the fleece is excellent.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Soft and warm,5,"Nice and soft. Pretty durable. I’ve been wearing it all winter, sometimes just using it as my winter outerwear. Not good as a windbreaker though. Wind goes right through it and you’ll feel it. I’ve noticed Amazon raised the price of this over twenty percent since I purchased it. It was a great value at fifteen dollars."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Nice looking. Not as soft as it looks.,4,I purchased as a Christmas gift. It wasn’t as soft as I thought it would be but it looks very nice. We gave it to my moms boyfriend to Keep him warm while snow blowing and he said he was going to keep for nice. He is a shorter man so I’m not sure how the length would fit on a taller person. But it fit him perfectly.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,So many men's clothes are better than women's!,4,"Female here. I got the men's version because the women's looked too short. This covers a lot of my butt and thus keeps me warmer.It isn't as warm as I'd like, but it's warm enough for now, under a rain jacket in November in NW WA."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,GREAT!!!,5,"This fleece jacket is a great deal!  It is well made and warm.  It fits well it arrived early.  No shedding for me as others have said.  I bought two jackets, weird that only one of them has zippered pockets, same company, only thing different is color.  Would buy again, right now, but I don't need more fleece.  LOVE IT!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great Pattern! Great jacket!,5,Great pattern. Great fit. Very warm jacket.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,For as expected,5,I have a broad shoulders and size medium fits perfectly over my base layer. I’ve had multiple other fleeces that are too tight at the chest and would limit the range of motion.This fleece is similar to my Columbia Steens Mountain at half the price. The lack of logo also makes it more appropriate to wear in a work setting.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,A SUPER +++++!!!!!,5,Love this jacket!  I bought a size larger for comfort.  I sit in a wheelchair with a 5 pound service dog and wanted room to stuff her down the front.  It has two massive pockets inside big enough to hold a kindle easily.  Its SUPER SOFT!  and Incredibly Warm and Comfy.  I love lounging in this one!  I even fell asleep in it one night.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great jacket at a great price.,5,"Just a tad larger than I anticipated, but fits nicely and extremely soft and comfortable. Very sturdy construction with heavy duty zipper and inside/outside pockets. Great price and great quality, too, make it a very good deal."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,XS Fits Big,2,I normally wear an XS.  This fit more like a big S and was very loose fitting at the neck.  It's odd because I purchased a couple of the patterned colors and they fit perfectly.  The black and navy colors fit way large.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Good fit, comfortable, great value!",5,"I'm a 5'8"" woman, 123 lbs. I bought an XS and it fits just the way that I had hoped. The arms are a bit long but I like the extra coverage to keep my hands warm. The length almost completely covers my hips. I love the weight and feel of this fleece. I can wear it as a casual medium weight sweater for cool weather or under a heavier outer layer for cold weather. The zip up pockets are a plus! This fleece sweater is a great value!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great bargain for your money,5,I love the quality of this lightweight jacket it fits perfectly and it has bigger and more pockets than I expectedI had no idea that it had rather large inside pockets as well as outside pocketsI am so impressed with the quality of this jacket that I am going to order some extras
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Top quality, beautiful!",5,"Absolutely love this, better than expected. Bought it for my husbands birthday and he’s very fussy. He loves the fit and said it’s comfortable and warm, great for cool nights. He’s a small frame guy 5’7” and about 135lbs. And always cold. The fit and fabric is awesome, very well made. Going to buy a couple more for Christmas."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great fit & price,5,"It fits a little loose, which is perfect for a lightweight jacket. Ample polar fleece fabric to help stay warm. Dk Green color is great. Price is great. Zipper & stitching looks good too. Holds up to multiple washings so far. Door-front delivery appreciated, esp during pandemic. Happy to recommend!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Windbreaker,2,This was supposed to be a light weight windbreaker and when it arrived it was made out of a fairly heavy material that would not be good for wearing into summer or any time when you need something very thin type of cotton.
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Great Inside Liner at Fraction of Cost,5,"I have a Columbia cold weather parka that needed a replacement liner.  I looked at Columbia and the price was $89.  I searched options and found the Amazon Basic liner for $20.  I was extremely satisfied with the product, its exactly the same as the brand option for a fraction of the price.  Tested in 10deg F on a mountain hike in December."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,GREAT LIGHT-WEIGHT JACKET,5,"I bought this jacket for myself after trying on one my husband had purchased.  I'm 5'7"" and  long-limbed.  The sleeves  are the perfect length (mid-palm).  The chest is roomy without being too large or too tight, and the high collar is snug enough to keep the neck warm without drafts.  I've washed both jackets several times and they come out looking good as new."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,"Fits well, very warm and comfortable.",5,"I live in the south, so we don't have harsh winters but it can get cold. I have a heavy coat I wear sometimes but this is my go to in the fall and winter. Very warm comfy, and fits perfectly. Im of an athletic build, medium sized man and the medium fits perfect. What was good is on the product page, Amazon said the model was 6'2"" and wearing a medium which really helped me decide."
Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket,Warm and comfy,4,"I typically wear a medium woman’s but in this case, the x-small men’s size fit me snug. I bought this as a warm layer for over a wool base layer and it is working out well. I like that the length (since it is a men’s cut) goes below my hips so it really helps keep me warm."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,... an older NorthFace Apex Bionic Soft shell that I love. but after a few years of camping in ...,5,"I have an older NorthFace Apex Bionic Soft shell that I love. but after a few years of camping in it and having a lighter color, I decided I want to get a second one in black because years of camping and hiking grime and campfire soot made it dingy and unattractive. It still works great but not appropriate to wear to work because it makes me look like a dirt-bag. So I wanted to get a second one to wear everywhere except the trail and keep the dirty one for the backwoods. Unfortunately, My house got messed up pretty bad and both my cars were totaled in Hurricane Mathew and a lot of the stuff I wanted or needed this winter had to be dialed down so I could afford repairs. Then I found this black Columbia Ascender soft shell and found it was half as much as the northface and even better, the one with the electric blue zipper was even less! I wasn't too keen on the blue zipper but after I wore it a while it grew on me and I love it now and glad I got it over the plain black on black. It was worth it both on looks and the bargain price.The following information is based on my opinion when comparing the NorthFace Apex Bionic to this Columbia Ascender:1. The Columbia is fitted in a way that is more complimentary to my shape. Its wider at the shoulders its slightly tapered at the waist and the sleeves are a little more snug compared to the Northface. the Columbia is more formfitting and is flattering to the body even if you don't have a perfect six pack body (which I definitely do not). The northface is generally more loose fitting and creates the illusion of a flattering body shape by the two tone color design (obviously not true of the (TNF Black on Black version).2. isulative ability i find that both jackets are equal in this area.3. Water resistance, both are very impressive, neither one is completely waterproof, and the Columbia I think is slightly better in this area.4. Comfort wise , advantage goes to Columbia. They have a fabric lining where the northface has fabric with a web like netting material in some sections. Both are comfortable Columbia is just more comfortable. also because of the way its fitted, the Columbia is more snug while the Northface is a little looser so if you are wearing this with your regular clothes to go to and from work or to wear a sweater while working outside in the cold, the Columbia will be comfortable. If you are doing winter Camping and spending long periods outside in freezing or sub freezing, then the Northface can accommodate more layers and fit more comfortably. I have worn a long sleeve compression Tee, thermals, cotton tee shirt, and hooded sweatshirt with wool lining and the North Face Bionic over the top and was warm and my movement was not restricted. Was able to hike in sub freezing temps, with good mobility and not need a heavy coat.If you are not hiking and just sitting still for several hours you will need a warmer coat but if you are active this will be adequate with sufficient layers. If you prefer the look of the Columbia and want to wear this many layers buy a size larger than your actual size."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Size differences between Ascender & Ascender II,4,"I just purchased both the Ascender and Ascender II jackets in Large-Tall to compare the fit and feel between the two. I am 6' 2"" and about 220 pounds, on a middle ground between wearing standard size and tall size clothes. Because of my size, fit is everything.If the Ascender could be considered the original version of this jacket, then the Ascender II is the ""slim fit"" version. Here are the differences I noticed:- The upper body of the Ascender II is much slimmer than the original Ascender. I would estimate the Ascender II to accommodate chest sizes a good 1-2 inches smaller than the Ascender can accommodate.- As others have noted, the fit between the two jackets is most noticeable in the shoulders/armpits. Arm cutouts on the original Ascender, while still trim, are much more generous than on the II. As a result, only slimmer arms will have an easy time slipping into the sleeves of the II.- Sleeves are about half an inch longer on the II as compared to the original. Sleeves on the original are also slightly wider all the way down to the wrist.- The collar is much larger on the II than the original. When popped up, the collar of the II has a very pronounced look and sticks out a good bit. When fully zipped to the top, the original Ascender provides more neck room.This is not to say the Ascender II is not a good jacket. It's just the version you'd want to get if your frame allows you to wear ""slim fit"" or ""tailored fit"" clothes. If that's not you, then the original Ascender is the jacket for you."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Looks good, runs fairly large",4,"I cant yet speak to water resistance or extreme cold, but a comfortable jacket in my experience and looks good, able to straddle the line between casual going out apparel and sporting ""outerwear.""  One annoyance is that the collar wont really un-pop entirely, and often scrapes against my chin when I turn.  I have tried to fold it over in the collar and have it sort of sit flat like a lapel, but it doesn't quite stay flat and always raises back up over time.My main comment to make is on the sizing.  In my opinion this runs pretty large for anyone used to a lot of other, slimmer brands.  I'm 5'9, 165lbs, with athletic build.  I typically wear a medium t-shirt, and while I don't wear ultra tight skinny jeans, I prefer clothes that don't droop off me like some kid who dug through dad's closet.  Target's Mossimo athletic cut shirts for example fit me perfectly, with no excess fabric in the arms or chest (but without being full on ""bro"" tight), and slack in the waist and stomach.  After mulling it over for a while and looking at other reviews where they specified their exact size, I ordered this jacket in Small instead of Medium, and I definitely made the right choice.  I still have ample room in the stomach and a little in the chest, but the arms and general proportions worked out well for what I was looking for.  I'm sure I would have been swimming in the medium."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,4x big fits me - see review for details on my size,5,"I bought the 4x big. I am 6'2"" 320 pounds and have an @ 52 inch waist with 56"" chest. The 4x fits but is on the large size. If I was to order again I would get the 3x big. Note that sleeves a plenty long. Good value for jacket. I write this because no on tends to state what their size is and what size jacket they ordered."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Some comparisons,5,"This jacket is wonderful. As soft and light as a fleece, with all the benefits of a weather resistant shell. I tried this alongside several other jackets that cost a lot more. I liked this one better. See below for comparisons.Northface apex bionic 2: I expected to really like this one, but I was unimpressed. The sleeves were unusually long, and they don't have any elastic or velcro in the wrists, so they just hang. I also found the forearms strangely tight, so that it was difficult to get my arms in when wearing long sleeves. I also though the rubber stamped north face logo looked cheap, compared to the stitched columbia logo. Definitely not worth $150.Marmot gravity: this is a nice jacket, but it had limited color selection, and the waistband was too tight compared to others. A good choice if you want black or grey and don't mind spending the $150.Oregon research ferrosi: also a good quality jacket, but much thinner than all the others. It doesn't have a soft fleece lining inside. It's more of just a shell. Its fabric is much more stretchy, which is nice for mobility, but it makes it look less crisp and more frumpy. Good for the trail, but not so good for casual use around town. Definitely not suitable for the office.The columbia was just right. Warm, but not too warm. Comfortable enough to wear on a hike. Attractive enough to wear to the office. My only complaint is that the velcro tabs at the wrist are a bit clunky, but they work well, and I'm glad to have them. I'm 5'11"" 165lbs and the medium fit perfectly.Colors: be aware that the amazon pictures are pretty inaccurate. The boulder is a lighter grey than pictured. I think of it as ""1980s sweatshirt grey"". The graphite is a darker grey with a slight bluish tint. This is ""postal worker uniform grey"". The black is a stark black with a stark white logo. The blacks of the north face and marmot were softer and (to my eye) more attractive. The surplus green is darker than pictured, more of a forest green. I liked the green quite a bit (more than I expected) and kept it over the others."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Hard finding a jacket that fits.  Not anymore,4,"I'm 6'2"" and around 260lbs.  I have long arms and pretty broad shoulders , and a a fair sized gut, so I'm always having problems finding clothes that fit, especially jackets.  I originally ordered this in a XXLT, and although it fit around shoulders and arm length was perfect, the midsection was WAY to big.  So I sent it back and got an XLT instead.  The XLT fits perfectly.  No complaints, but I'd suggest using my size as a control.  If you're bigger than me get the XXLT, and if you're 30-40lbs. less that me I'd suggest LT (if they have that size)."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Worth the wait,5,"Love this jacket already! I've waited for about a year for this color to be restocked, and when Amazon finally alerted me that it was back in stock, it was for much less than most of the colors are listed for.While I live in Vegas, and it's currently August, I can't speak to the warmth and wind resistance at this point since I won't be using this for another 3ish months.The fit...I'm 6' tall and 250 lbs. Yes, I have a belly, 40-42"" waist depending on the pants. The XL fits exactly as I'd hoped it would! Again, being August, no stores here have this jacket in stock, so trying one on in person is a no-go. Based on the sizing chart (chest size, specifically), this jacket fits just like I want it to. The sleeves fall just barely past the wrist. I'm excited for the cold weather to give me a reason to use this. The fleece lining inside is quite warm. I've had similar jackets and know this lining will be warm without adding bulk. As others have stated though, it will grip most materials, and has a tendency to create static cling... not a deal breaker for me, though!The black/blue combination is better than I expected too, but that's just personal preference.Columbia is quality all the way."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Nice Jacket,4,"First off, I'm 6'5"" (1.96 m), 200 lbs (91 kg) and have an athletic build. I ordered size Large Tall.The Fit: The fit is reasonably good. The shoulders fit very well, the chest has enough room. The body length is good and this is the first jacket I've had in a long time where the sleeves are sufficiently long. The sleeves also are large enough to be comfortable moving around. The mid-section doesn't fit as well. Like many tall sized clothes, the assumption seems to  be that if you're tall you must also be big. It would be nice if it came in an inch or two from the chest to just above the waist. This isn't as bad when wearing a sweatshirt or sweater, but when just wearing a t-shirt or dress shirt it is almost too big. I decided to keep it anyway because it's hard to find a tall jacket that is tall enough, and even though the mid-section is big, it doesn't look worse for it.Features: This is what you would expect from a softshell jacket. It is warm enough to work for temps just below freezing, maybe lower if you layer. It is not as wind resistant as I expected, but isn't bad. I haven't tried it in the rain yet. The pockets are large and insulated, so they will keep your hands warm.Overall it's a solid jacket. It is more comfortable than the LL Bean jacket it replaced, and $40 cheaper."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Perfect every day jacket for fall/ winter,5,"The perfect shell jacket for everyday wear blocks the wind is weather resistant doesn't make any crinkly sounds and doesn't look like you're going to go snowboarding.Nice looking to where to take your kids to school plays you know it gives you a pulled together look, not tight, great for guys with wide shoulders too has some stretch, non clingy perfect length for a tall person it also has the option of cinching the bottom if you want a shorter length. The perfect coat I have them in black and Olive .The best coat.!Sz reference:I am6'2"" 280lb.I have sz 3xl in these coats,and in most shirts..(5.11, or kohls sonoma brand or apt.9) I take a 2xlt, in pants a size 44."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Husband loves it!,5,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas as he needed a new coat. He runs hot and is often in and out of many buildings a day for work so I wanted something lightweight that would still be decently warm. I would say combined with a long sleeve or sweater this coat is good for him for down to 25-30 degrees for short periods of time outside. Iordered the L long because he is 6’3 and doesn’t like his clothes super fitted or anything to be too short. For the most part it fits nice but is a little on the loose side, good for layering under. The sleeves are a bit long but not bad enough to warrant sizing down. Overall it was a great deal for a nice jacket!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great jacket,5,"My son is built like a linebacker. At 6'5"" and 325 lbs with a long torso, it is hard to find clothes that fit. Regular extra sized shirts come to his navel. We live in Florida so a super heavy jacket is not a necessity but there are plenty of winter days when you need more than a little something something, especially when you start work at 4 am. This jacket fit that bill. The outside work well to keep the wind out while the inner layer is just enough to ward off a chill.He typically wears a 3xl tall and that size is usually plenty roomy. But the 3xl tall in the first Columbia jacket I ordered was tight across the chest. I ordered this one in a 4xl tall and it fits perfectly.This is a really nice jacket for the price. My husband owns the same jacket and loves it."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,No way to exchange this.,2,"Buying the right size on line is hit and miss. They say you can ""exchange"" it for the right size. But there is no option for doing that. You can return it, and lose the price, incentive, or other benefit and order again at the higher price. Ideally, I should have gone to the store and just tried them on to see if it fit. I would like to try the next smaller size, to see if that would work, but it cost money. If I did not need a tall size, or if a local store carried the tall, I would not want this agrevation, and would avoid it."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,It's the perfect fit and finish,5,"Very happy with the fit and finish. I was looking for something not too loose nor tight. I am size M in T-shirts but all my jackets and fleeces are size Large because most manufactures come with some problem at the shoulder width or sleeves length. Most of them come with the narrow shoulder but long sleeves and I hate that so I have to go one size up to at least have a decent/comfortable shoulder but then have to deal with those ridiculous extreme long sleeves.  Also, I don't like a little ""tail - if you will"" at the end of the back of some models. I don't know what is the purpose of that extra fabric on the back but to me looks ugly and useless. This Columbia Ascender softshell jacket has none of those defects. Shoulder, chest and sleeves are perfectly true to size, there is no tail on the back (completely round around the waist without any extras.) I ordered size M and color Tusk which is like a light FDE. Very nice color and not like it appears in the photo. I would give it 10 stars if zippers were a bit more robust and better quality. All in all, very happy with this softshell jacket specially if you purchase it on sale for half price like I did."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,You get what you pay for,3,"I followed advice from others and ordered the Tall large. I'm 6'4"" and about 210 lbs. So the fit seems right. It comes with a price tag of $125, but it's hard to believe that anyone would have paid that. At $36  the price is right, but this is not a great jacket.  The sleeves are way long and would be good if your sleeve length is 37-38. I knew it would have the chest zipper that I hate. No pockets inside, but at least all of the pockets zip.  The jacket smells of the synthetic of which it's made. It reminds me a bit of my snorkeling/diving suit.  I've been seeking to replace a great LL Bean fleece and this is not it. I guess I'll keep this, but I wonder if I'll become more fond of it or stop wearing it."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Great coat, runs a little small",5,"I bought this shoftshell jacket for the cold and wet autumn weather and the jacket performed as desired. I have bought other columbia fleece's and jackets in the past so I knew I could expect the same quality from this jacket.Pro's:-Great jacket build quality-In the wind the jacket blocks out a majority of the wind and any rainfall just beads up on the jacket and easily rolls off-Adjustable sleeve cuffs so you can tighten them down if you get too cold.-Pockets have zippers to keep valuables protected and in place.-Lightweight and extremely comfortableCon's:-Unfortunately the jacket runs slightly small. I bought the jacket 1 size larger than what I normally wear to ensure that the jacket could accommodate a sweatshirt underneath for really cold situations and the fit was too snug to do this with.Overall this is a great jacket for any occasion, just be conscious of the size selection and how you plan to use the coat.I would definitely recommend this and buy again!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Love it.,5,"The lengths and widths are good.  The sleeves go right to my wrists, and the jacket goes just below my belt.  Large fits perfectly (6'0"" Male, 170lbs).  I wear it everyday and am wearing it right now.  Water beads up and rolls off of the jacket better than you can imagine.  The zippers are solid.  The Velcro on the sleeves are good; I find myself adjusting them when I take on/off the jacket to keep wind from going up my arms (I live in a windy area).One thing about the jacket that bugs me is the collar; it never seems to lay down exactly right.  If you 'pop' the collar, I think it looks weird and feels a bit weird too.  I think I'm just picky though.It also seems to be a bit difficult to spot wash.  I got some sawdust on me and it took a few days for the dust to go away and the color to go back to its deep black.  No amount of brushing the dust off seemed to do the trick.  Other things you may get on it seem to stick around for a while too, but will eventually fade away.  The color after wearing it daily for a few months is still as dark as when I bought it.The jacket is warm, especially for just being a softshell.  If you're looking to go play in the snow, Columbia has better options for you.  This is more of a casually cold weather jacket.Would recommend."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great choice for a variety of conditions,5,"I ended up purchasing two of these jackets in black.  One for working in the yard and out in the public, and second I have set aside for more dressy occasions.  I was impressed with the fit, the overall quality of the jacket for the price, its lightness and thinness, and its use in a range of temperatures and conditions.  I have used it for light winds and 60 degrees, and heavy winds in the high 20s.  I have worn it both for shoveling snow and for attending a play.  In all extremes, it performed perfectly.  Both the outside of the jacket and inside liner dries quickly.  In my opinion, this jacket is an exceptional value for the price.  I have much more expensive jackets with big outdoor names, but this one has become my go to choice for all but the most extreme conditions."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Excellent price, great jacket.",4,"Excellent price, great jacket.I very rarely give out 5 stars, would have to be exceptional. This jacket Ascender Softshell...is perfect weight for me when I need to  run around hospitals, indoor and outdoors for short periods between buildings or campuses.Hospital has positive airflow, so there is always a breeze, no good in scrubs to have nipples that could cut glass. This jacket a has 2 zippered pockets just above the waist line, but low enough for me to keep my arms straight, a plus. There is a chest pocket on the front upper left but none inside at all. The collar is semi stiff, it does stand up, its only about 3 inches tall, so you wont save yourself from New England winters with a 3in collar. No the less i bought a 3xlt, at my height 6'2, and around 259lb. The fit was a little more generous in length than i expected but fix generally how all Columbia fit...a little small, where is this archetype? The jacket has a medium weight, about a heavyweight champion sweatshirt in my estimate. Again Great price , just what i needed, something to run around in, take the bus(till dec, then too cold),  wear while at work, and can be used as an interior layer for a winter coat."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Nice jacket with a few minor issues,4,"I really like this jacket. The weight is great for anything from cool spring/fall days all the way down to freezing temps. It blocks wind well and does an admirable of keeping me dry while I walk across a rainy parking lot. The classic simple style makes it easy to wear with just about anything.There are a couple of minor things that would make it even better. The sleeves are fleece-lined, which makes for a warm feel but makes it a bit more difficult to pull it off if I'm wearing long sleeves, especially if I'm wearing a sweater. The other thing I'm not crazy about is that the collar will NEVER lie flat. One side always always always sticks up. It's not unique to this jacket, nearly every soft shell I've ever owned has had this problem. I suppose it's handy if you actually zip it up all the way, but who does that?I still wear it a lot. It's my go-to jacket if it's above 25F outside."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,I WANT ONE NOW!!!,5,"Ordered this Columbia jacket for my husband and was quite surprised at how much nicer it is than I expected!!!  The tag says ""Made in India"" if you need that for comparison.  My husband is short and stocky (5'7"" tall, 270 lb, 50-52"" waist).  The 4X/Big I ordered fits him perfectly with an additional bit of room to add a light sweater underneath this jacket if needed.  I checked it over carefully and all seams and top-stitching are straight and neatly finished (inside and out).  The colored trim detail is really nice and neatly done.  Nothing sloppy, no hanging threads.  The jacket is fully lined (even the sleeves) with a lightweight fleece-like fabric.  I love it (it looks great on him) and HE loves it!!!!  Fantastic Deal!!!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Nice, but has one infuriating flaw",2,"I wore this as a light rain jacket from time to time over the summer, no problem.  Over thin, short-sleeve shirts.  Now it is colder and I'm trying to wear it over a woolen shirt or a cotton sweatshirt.  The LINING in this jacket is such HIGH FRICTION against these materials that it is difficult to get on and almost IMPOSSIBLE to remove without help;!!!!  I don't live where I need anything heavier than this for going to the grocery store, but I'm going to have to find a ""winter windbreaker"" to replace this one."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Perfect! Comfy!,5,"For a large guy that just over 400lbs (don't hate), this coat fits perfectly. I highly recommend this coat. I also recommend buying the tall version if you have a tall torso. Its very comfortable. Im going to buy one for my son!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Bogus zipper,1,I purchased this as a “fall” jacket and the use was pretty limited.I live in Alaska so there’s a short window for this between a t-shirt and the 700 north face puffy jacket.In that time the zipper totally gave up.Total disappointment.I’d donate this otherwise good jacket to goodwill but would feel guilty knowing that it’s ultimately useless.Hobos deserve better.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Very Pleased with my Purchase,5,"I purchased this jacket for Fall and when it arrived it fit perfectly.  I doesn't have a baggy or bulky look.  The jacket appears to be well made and I find it to be more water resistant than I anticipated.  Water actually beads on the outside of the jacket while keeping me dry.My only slightly negative comment is the front chest pocket.  The zipper opens down right to the bottom of the pocket.  I keep my cell phone in the chest pocket so I find that if I don't zip the pocket, my phone falls right out.  I wish the pocket were just slightly deeper so the phone would sit deeper in the pocket and not require the pocket to be 1/2 zippered to retain the phone.  Otherwise this is a great jacket.  I'll likely purchase another in a different color."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,this zipper is garbage!!!!,1,"finally happened to have weather today where i wanted to wear this jacket, and as soon as i work the zipper a few times, it split just right and now the zipper is stuck. and from what i can tell, its been too long and now i cant send it back! DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!!!!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Get a size bigger,4,"Had this jacket a little over a month now and am impressed. This is the first ""soft shell"" jacket I have ever owned. It  took a little getting used to but the more I wear it the more comfortable it gets. The lining in the sleeves was a little scratchy and the feel of the jacket was rigid but the more I have worn it the lining in the sleeves has become softer and the jacket feels more broken in and is very comfortable. I couldn't see wearing it in any temp over 60 f. It definitely cuts the wind and rain.I had read previous reviews and questions in regards to sizing. Most guys with bigger frames recommended sizing up, so I did and it was the right call. For reference, I'm 6'1 325lbs, very broad shoulders and very thick chest. I'm also taller in the torso. When I buy shirts (any kind) I wear a 3xlt and it's a good fit. After reading the reviews and questions, I ordered the 4xlt. Fits absolutely perfect."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Good everyday jacket,4,"Nice light jacket for everyday use, car camping, or day hikes. Sheds some water off in light rain. I’m a big guy & am pretty happy with the fit of the XL. I caught this on sale for $35, and it’s an excellent value at that price.I probably wouldn’t use this for backpacking, it doesn’t pack down small enough & is too heavy for that. But as an general use outdoor jacket, I like it."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Comfortable,5,"Fit good for 6' 7"". Second purchase; first one is black and it's in good shape. I've had this grey on for 5 months now and it held up well. I wear it when it's windy and or theres light rain. These are the lighter versions as there is a version with a slightly heavier liner. Nice size pockets for when you should have worn gloves. There is a chest pocket on the left that convenience for every thing form car keys, to cell phone, to letters."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,This jacket is 'somewhat slim' among the columbia jackets(But the ...,5,"This jacket is 'somewhat slim' among the columbia jackets(But the part of neck is somewhat bigger)So if those who are wearing a 'common' columbia jacket in  'large size' wear a' thick' mid layer with this jacket (or if you wear 'multiple pieces' together with the jacket),there is a possibility that it is tight and uncomfortable for you.And because the length of the clothes is somewhat longer (because it covers the hips) , it can be warm during winter-outdoor activities.I think(in my opinion) if you wear it with the polartec100 series (by mid-layer), it will be enough to withstand around '20F+WINDY'.Above all things, I am grateful to Amazon for supplying good items at such a good price!!!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Would definetly buy this again,5,I bought this for my husband based on the reviews that I read. My husband is 6'2 and about 270 lbs. He has broad shoulders. He wears a xxl in tops but if I can find them in tall then he can wear a xl tall. This fit perfectly and was definetly long enough. Usually tops or jackets will ride up in the back but this one didn't. It's big enough to wear a shirt under. If you want to wear a hoody under it then I would advise going up a size. It was cold and windy when my husband wore the jacket and he couldn't feel the wind through the jacket. I am definetly happy with this purchase and so was he!
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Great fitting jacket for my 6'5"", 280lb hubby!",5,"We have been looking for quite some time for a jacket that was long enough in the arms and torso that didn't compromise how broad my husband's shoulders are.  He has a 34"" inseam, so he has a fairly long torso.  We have tried many jackets at Cabella's, Gander Mountain & Bass Pro, but always ""assumed"" that since the Columbia jacket was cheaper that it would be a waste of time trying it on.  I ordered this because it was so inexpensive and thought ""What do I have to lose""?  The only thing we ""lost"" was time...we should have tried the Columbia jacket a long time ago.  The material is high quality, the jacket comes below his belt and there is plenty of room in the shoulders for a long sleeve shirt and sweater.  He wore this to church on Sunday and the long sleeves of his shirt did not show--the jacket's arms were plenty long.  Long story short, we are very VERY pleased."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,this zipper is garbage!!!!,1,"had this for almost a month and finally had bad weather to wear it in. the zipper came undone after just a few uses. i had another one i hadnt worn yet, and worked the zipper and same thing. this is junk. DONT BUY THIS!!!!!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Very nice jacket,5,"Love the color and the jacket fits very nicely.  Kind of sleek looking with just the three pockets.  The chest pocket is very nice for iPhones (I have an 11 and it fits easily).  It keeps me warm to temps down to about freezing (32F).  Any colder, and you probably want to move up to a heavier coat or another layer underneath."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Disappointed,3,"I was looking for a replacement coat and this looked similar. I was replacing a coat I had bought at WalMart near my hotel in a moment of chilliness. This Colombia coat tho, man it does not compare. It is light, soft, and looks prone to stains (tho I didn't test it out). I wasn't impressed by a sturdy feeling, or a crisp presentation. It looked just a little frumpy, even brand new. I returned it."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,I actually like the Ascender better than the North face and wore ...,5,"I already had one of these in Black, I bought it to replace a North Face Apex Bionic. I actually like the Ascender better than the North face and wore it all winter. Then I saw there were other colors selling for less than $40 I had to go back and get a Khaki one, if the green is still available next time I shop amazon I will probably pick that one up too. The tags on the jackets I have received had a price tag of $130 retail price. if that is accurate then this is an awesome deal."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Perfect jacket for damp and chilly weather!,5,"What a great jacket. Not only is the fit perfect (I am normally a 3XL tall but others advised it ran a tad small) but it so comfortable. It is the perfect in-between cold and warm weather jacket. It has been rainy and abnormally cold (50's) in our area and it is great seeing the rain fall off this rain-proof jacket, plus it has been keeping me warm. I bought it for an upcoming trip to Scandinavia and I think I made the right decision."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Perfect Fit,5,"Purchased for my husband, his second one.Large Tall.  Nice length for his height 6’4”. Sit just below the belt and doesn’t look too short.  He likes the draw string at the side to chinch the bottom and that it’s lightweight."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Very good jacket, poor zipper",4,"Nice looking coat, good for mild winter weather (warm for me down to 10 degree F temps so far). It's a little tighter in the chest and a little looser at the bottom than I'd like, but only slightly. Both colors I tried (Shark, Graphite) are significantly darker in person than in the pictures. I don't care for how the drawcord at the bottom is only accessible on one side because when it's adjusted the material bunches up unevenly all the way around. I super don't like the zipper; the insertion pin doesn't slide into the retainer box smoothly (just google 'anatomy of a zipper' to see what I mean), so if you're not paying close attention every time you start to zip your jacket, the teeth are gonna come apart at the bottom. I'd prefer to give 3.5 out of 5 but Amazon's rating system doesn't work like that, so I'm rounding up to four."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great jacket.,5,"I purchased this jacket in the shark color with rust zippers.  The shark color is slightly darker than pictured, as well as the zippers being darker as well.  I actually like this.  As all Columbia products I have previously purchased, this jacket is very well made.  I fits just as expected and looks really sharp.  At $49, I feel that I've gotten a great deal."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Nice looking coat spring/fall.,5,"Pleased with the jacket. Nice soft inner shell. 2 hand pockets an nice deep chest pocket. Water resistant, light rain wouldn't wear in heavy rain. Does offer wind resistance and some warmth. Good Spring/Fall, maybe colder depending how you layer.It looks nice also."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Beautiful jacket. But,5,"Beautiful jacket.  But, man-oh-man, it took three tries to get the size right.  Folks, when you leave a review and say ""fits great"", or ""didn't fit"", it would surely help if you mention your size.Now for the particulars.  I am 6'1"", 255lbs.  Broad shoulders.  Small buttocks.  (I made that last one up.)  36"" sleeve length with dress shirts.  Sorry, girls, I am married, btw.  2XLT was way too big.  1XL was too small.  2XL is just right."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great jacket for cool day,5,I wore this jacket to go hike a Colorado mountain. This is a lightweight jacket that is soft but very sturdy and great construction.  I have only had it a short while but it seems like it will last a long time. I would guess it is good for temps from 40-60 degrees. You're not gonna wear it in snowstorms or in warm weather.For my hike in CO up a mountain in the spring it was perfect. It's a high quality jacket thst looks great and is very functional for hiking
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Good jacket for spring and fall,5,"It's hard to find a nice jacket that is not both big and tall but just a large-tall. This works great. It's a quality jacket with decent pockets. It's a little slimmer than I normally prefer but it is not too tight on me (6'1"" and 200 lbs). I bought the Collegiate Navy color which is nice although I feel like the Maytag repairman when I put it on. Ironically one of the first times I wore it was when I went to a friends house to fix his washer"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,This an Ascender II - NOT the original Ascender. There's a difference.,3,"I wanted an original Ascender as a back up for the one I already have. The problem is that there is an Ascender and an Ascender II and the sellers' ads (everywhere) always fail to properly designate what it is they are selling. This is actually the Ascender II. The sizing is different than the original Ascender, And the original has 2 internal, waist-level pockets that the Ascender II does NOT have.I wanted an original Ascender because those pockets really come in handy. But that's not what I got."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Snug, athletic fitting arms",3,"I had exchanged from a 2X to a 3XT but maybe I should have considered the 3XB?  The only problem is with the fit of the arms.  I have what I'm told is an original Ascender in black and wanted a similar in brown but it's not available in the original Ascender.  Honestly I think the one I've had (and absolutely love) is from an older interchange jacket that was a 3XT because it has ""interchange"" on the outside tag above the shoulders but when I contacted Columbia directly they said it was an Ascender.  I've tried finding an interchange jacket that comes with a soft shell liner in brown (3XT) but such an animal doesn't exist for purchase.  If you don't mind snug fitting arms this would be great but if you're wearing a sweater/sweatshirt underneath it's going to be tight."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,The perfect cool weather jacket,5,"I love this jacket.  It is my go-to for temps down to freezing.  Anything below and I will reluctantly pull out a heavier coat, but keep in mind that I'm not a fan of cold weather at all.  It's light enough that you can wear it open without overheating in warmer temps too.  It sheds water and blocks wind.  I love the chest pocket for holding my cellphone.  You can easily hear when you get a call and it's more convenient to use than I expected.  Columbia makes great products.  I see no reason to buy from an overpriced brand when you can get this good quality at a great price."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Terrific jacket,5,I am very pleased with this jacket it is possibly even a little bit heavier than I expected with a very nice warm lining. I expect I could wear it when the temperatures are easily into the 30s and maybe the 20s. I would recommend this jacket for sure
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,The moss color is much lighter in person,4,"I just bought this for my husband for xmas, he hasn't opened it yet so I don't know if it fits right (he's 6'1"", about 180lbs with long arms so I usually buy him Tall stuff for the extra inch or two) but the color is much lighter in person than in the picture.  It's more of a feminine light moss than a masculine moss color, if that makes any sense.  He usually looks great in greens, it's the best color for his skin tone and eye color, but I'm not too sure about this jacket now...  Hopefully he likes it, if not I'll have to return it for the darker blue option."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great Jacket!!,5,Excellent jacket for fall weather. Water just beads up and falls off and the inside links is quite warm yet the jacket itself feels light at the same time. Would highly recommend if you’re looking for a nice looking casual jacket for the cooler seasons.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Very good all purpose jacket.,4,Great product and one good fit.  Feels just like previous Columbia’s quality. It fit well but the waist is a little bit tighter than I expected but not too much. I didn’t like the parts of the finish so I cut and burned the loose strings around the zippers.  Warm enough for most Texas winters and kept out the rain. Glad I purchased.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great for Tall people,5,"It's hard to find tall and not big sizes. Columbia does well with their tall sizes. I'm 6'6"" and 235 lbs and it fits perfectly. Keeps me warm until it gets below 40° then I either need some think flannel or a heavier jacket. I keep keep it on until the temp gets about 75-80° too do it's a perfect fall in-between jacket when it's cold in the morning and warmer later in the day.Feels like really good material and can withstand some wear and tear."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Too lightweight. Provides little protection from cold.,1,I needed a new winter-time jacket. This is no good. Not warm enough. Doesn't fit well either. Hard to put on or take off. Do not like it. Will not buy another from this company. Will look to competitors to buy a replacement. Disappointed in this product. Waste of money.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Good fit,5,"Nice jacket. Not too tight or loose though I’d say more right than loose, which I like. I wear it camping and it’s good for that kind of outdoor use."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Good fall weather,5,I'm a plus size women wear 22/24. I've been on the hunt for a good fall coat. Living in Vermont I need something in between 0 degree winter coat and just a sweater. So I took a chance on the men's coat cause I can never find one in the women's area that I like & fits well. This coat fits fine. It's a little long in the arms. The green is more of a lighter shade of teal then in the picture. And I've noticed if wearing a sweater the sleeves static stick to me making it a task to get off but I would be comfortable buying again in a different color.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Exceeded expectations!,5,"I had purchased a cheaper softshell jacket from an unknown brand a couple of months before I bought this jacket and was extremely disappointed when the zipper broke not even six months after having it, so I decided to go with a more well-known, trusted brand and spend a little bit more money with to replace it. I'm so glad that I did. Columbia's jacket, while feeling thinner, is surprisingly much softer to the touch, much warmer and all around much more comfortable to wear than the one that I had before! Thankfully there have been zero zipper issues either!!The sizing was exactly as I estimated that it would be as well, so if you're looking for a really nice outdoor jacket for a big and/or tall guy, I would DEFINITELY recommend this one!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Good value for the price; a few quirks,4,"I've worn this plenty since I bought it, and have no real complaints, but just so you know before you try this style and brand, two things: 1) the fabric is a bit stuff and rubbery, so it's not the most comfortable thing ever, depending on what you're wearing under it, and 2) the collar on it is pretty tall.  The rest of the coat seems proportionate but the collar is maybe three inches or a bit more, and the collar is hard to turn down because of the material, so if you don't have an average or long neck, be aware, though tall necks seem to be a trend with a lot of these kinds of coats so maybe it's me rather than the coat."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Excellent soft shell jacket for SoCal winter!,5,I've had this jacket since Dec 2015 and wore it several times since then mostly for mountain biking in SoCal.  One night it was 37 degrees and windy near the peak.  I was wearing a merino wool long sleeve base layer and this jacket with shorts.  Was not nearly as cold as the other guys.  Has Velcro straps near your wrists to block wind and tighter waist support as well to further block wind/cold.  Rain and wind resistant as well.  Plus the black/blue color scheme looks fantastic.  Zipper comes up to top of neck.  Maybe doesn't breathe the best but for the price you can't beat this jacket.  Highly recommended.  Btw the 3 zippered pockets are highly functional as well.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,I love this jacket!,5,I am very happy with this jacket.  It's very warm and still lightweight.  I purchased the 3XLT size that I usually wear and it was roomy without being overly large.  The sleeves are plenty long enough to cover an inch or two of my hand which means it won't ride up my arm if I extend it or raise it above my shoulder.  I am very satisfied with it and I'm glad I purchased it.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Columbia is a leader in outerwear!,5,"For years I have looked for the perfect jacket, and over the past 6 months I have found 2 jackets both being Columbia. The Ascender jacket is the perfect mix of nicer/dressy but still having the enough material to keep you warm. Like most clothing options I recommend buying two sizes to see which fit you like, your true to size and then one below for a more snug fit. 10/10 would recommend!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Happy with the jacket, warmer than expected but only worn three times and zipper is jacked up",3,"Kinda disappointed. The jacket is exactly what I wanted in fit, quality, features, but I’ve only had the opportunity to wear it a few times and the zipper is already jacked up.  Not happy about that.  Besides that, the fit is good, features are what I was looking for, maybe a little on the heavy side, but still manageable. I wanted a light jacket, and this is a touch heavier than light."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Love these jackets,5,"Love these jackets, my husband got one for Christmas and I just bought one for my son for back to school.  It is lightweight but has a nice soft lining which for him is a must.  Even though the look is slimming the jacket does not fit tight.  It blocks out the chill and rain and for a Pacific NW fall it is perfect.  My son't favorite color is red and the red jacket is a beautiful shade, not too orange but not like burgundy, it is a nice fire engine type red color.  The price here on amazon can't be beat for this item."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Fits true to sizing chart,5,"I was hesitant on sizing. Usually I would order a men's large. Based off other reviews and the sizing chart, I went with the medium. I am 5'10"" and 165 lbs. It fits perfect! If I had a sweatshirt on underneath, it's be too snug. Otherwise, it's a perfect fit. I am happy with the look and feel of the jacket too. Very sharp!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great Jacket!,5,Finally a 3xlt Columbia Jacket that wasn't out of stock. I like the color and the fabric. Both are very much the current style.  My only concern is the right arm hole is a little tight when you first put it on. It isn't really noticeable when wearing the jacket. Just occasionally annoying if you reach with your right arm.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,The coat is exactly what I needed,5,"The is a tiny slight large but just right for room, comfortable feel, and very light on your body. I would recommend this coat for all my workers who deal with with outside or go to clients office areas on a big campus that you can walk. The coat is very durable during them cold days is 20 degrees and up."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Great jacket! Awesome color options, versatile.",5,"I love these jackets! I’ve purchased 4 now over the last 8 years and every single one I’ve loved! I even convinced my office to purchase them to be embroidered with our logo, and everyone loves them! Good for weather down to 20 degrees, not for an extended period, but good protection against wind and rain."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Everything perfect except...,4,"I love this jacket. It fits perfectly, is just the right weight, is fine in the rain and is a great color (green). The only thing I don't like is the zippers on the pockets. Because of the direction of the zipper, it is impossible to zip closed with just one hand. I'd have only taken off a half poiint if it was possible."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Good jacket, XL is a little large",5,"I am a consistent XL size, 46"" chest / 21"" torso length - but with long arms (36"") that usually mean I need to buy Tall to get the arms to fit.  This jacket fits moderately loose in the chest - if pulled snug there is 3"" of overlap.  Sleeve length is about perfect, if I stick my arms out in front of me and round my shoulders I can get the cuffs just above the knobs of my wrists.  Length is a tad long, coming down to the bottom of crotch when standing straight/relaxed.Materials and construction are very good, no surprise with Columbia"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Love this thing,5,"A great light jacket that fits almost any scene. Very easy to throw on and very comfortable. More rigid than a sweatshirt, but not nearly as puffy as a winter jacket. If wearing in cold windy weather, I would recommend putting a sweatshirt underneath because it lets a little wind through"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"2XLT perfect fit for 6'8"" 325 lbs",5,I love Columbia products. They are usually offered in Tall lengths which helps for a tall guy like me. Sleeves are perfect length and the jacket is long enough to boot. Quality product from Columbia
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great buy!,5,Love this jacket! I would never wear a coat or jacket even when I really should before I got this one. Now I wear it even when I don’t really need to. It’s comfortable and looks great. I’m a big guy and I never want a jacket that’s bulky so this one is perfect.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Jacket,5,"Love the color, goes with everything, you can dress up or down. Great look with everything. Perfect fit all the way around. I have one and my hunny loved so I bought him one also."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Super comfortable,5,"Ordered a XXLT because most XXL are still too short. I'm 6'4 about 260 and this jacket is big on me. I prob could have sent it back and gotten an XLT, but was worried it would be to small around the waist. Overall the jacket is very comfortable and keeps me warm. I would buy it again"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this jacket is,5,"I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this jacket is, I highly recommend, I am 6ft 3inches, 250lbs and the XXL fits me perfect.  I have large shoulders and the coat fits nicely in my arm length, the waist is adjustable so it tapers nicely sometimes XXL can be square.  With how reasonable priced this coat was I thought I was buying this coat for outdoor work when I paint or do yard work, but the coat is so nice it is now my go too fashion coat on these cool nights.  It looks and feels great at the Amazon price you would be a fool not to buy it.  Thank You for the great amazon deal."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Good lightweight jacket, color is not quite as red",5,"I needed a new lightweight jacket that didn't bunch up long sleeves on button down shirts.  Plenty of room for undershirt sleeves and fits as expected for the size.  The color is a bit more of a dull red/burnt red than bright red though like the picture, which I actually thought was better than blazing bright red."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Less expensive than North Face's Apex Bionic, works just as well but with a better fit/style",5,"The Ascender is similar to North Face's Apex Bionic soft shell, but the fit is slimmer and cleaner. The sleeves are a tad short (seems to be a trend with Columbia) but everything else fits true. The interior is fleece lined, while the outer shell is a typical softshell material - wind resistant and slightly water resistant. During heavy rain, it tends to start wicking rain but I never feel it from the inside. I don't recommend wearing just a soft shell below 50F, and instead layer up with a fleece or liner like Columbia's Mighty Lite.Overall: 5/5 stars"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great softshell coat!,5,This was a great soft shell coat!  I normally wear short sleeve shirts all year round and was somewhat wary about having such a thin jacket.  It kept me pretty warm in the upper 20's and higher.  Anything lower than 20-25 then I'd recommend layering up which I did and I was plenty warm!  Jacket is 100% water proof!  Anytime I'd been out in the rain the water just beads right up on it and you can just brush it off.  Even after a couple of washes the water still beads up!  It's been an awesome coat!
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Comfortable and attractive jacket,5,"This is a very nice-looking jacket. In fact, the first time I wore it out in public one of the first people I knew that I ran into said ""That's a really sweet jacket you're wearing."" It feels good and is warm.It also, surprisingly, fits me quite well. I ordered an XL, but it fits like an XLT, which I like, as I have very long arms. So that makes me happy, but would probably be an issue for someone who expects standard XL-length sleeves."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Not for the Tall of Torso,2,"Purchased for a 6'4 (and some change) average build guy. I got a Large Tall. The fit seemed fine but since he's got a long torso, this thing looked super weird. The bottom of the jacket ballooned out a bit and hit a little too awkwardly above his butt. The color of this is nice; I ordered the blue/orange looking one and in person, the color seemed almost hunter green with traces of blue. He liked it but not enough to keep for the way it hung. Maybe better for the all-legs tall but if your height is in your torso, this is probably not the best."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great fit,4,"Great fit, as expected.  Nice lighter weight jacket for those not so cold winter/fall days.  Great at stopping wind and precipitation.  Loose enough to have a sweater or fleece on under it and not have it feel tight, but not too loose to be uncomfortable in a just a shirt."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Tall mans jacket,5,"So far I like this coat. It's a bit lighter weight than I thought it would be. It has a more ""tailored"" fit, but I like the chest pocket and zip up hand pockets. There is not an inside pocket but it is fully lined with a light fleece type liner. The sleeves are actually long enough for my 38"" reach. I would recommend this jacket especially for extra tall men."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Wacky arm length drops this from a 5 star to a 1 star.,1,"I love this coat but the sizing is WAY off.  I was replacing another identical Columbia Jacket I had bought locally and had just worn out.  I verified it was indeed the identical coat and also verified the measurements.  It should have fit the same.  When it arrived and I tried it on, everything was great with the exception of the length of the arms.  They were way to long and my fingertips don't even stick out the ends.  So, now in order to wear it, I have to roll the sleeves way up and it looks absolutely ridiculous.  Consequently, I haven't worn it and planned to return it but just noticed that I barely missed the return window.  The quality and comfort of the coat is great and would make it five stars, but the crazy arm sizing drops it to a one star."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Warm jacket for Fall or mild Winters,5,"Excellent jacket. It'll keep you warm down to the upper 40s with a long-sleeved shirt, but you should layer accordingly for colder temps. With a fleece or synthetic/down packable layered under you could go down to the 20s. I'm 5'8"" 165 and the med fits nicely with room for a layer underneath, without looking bulky. The Ascender is also svelte enough to use as a midlayer under a ski or rain shell for colder temps 40 and below."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great fit. Very happy,5,"Exactly what I was looking for. Light weight, but super cozy, great wind breaker! Fit perfectly for a big guy. Thankful for name brand companies that make big & tall clothes. The cool kids on the playground didn’t wear HUSKY. Thank you Columbia for a great product."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Looks good; good fit as expected. Good value for price, but one problem.",3,"I had an older Columbia canvas jacket that I wore all the time, such that the cuffs became threadbare. My wife made me get a new one, said I couldn't wear the old one anymore, so I chose this from what Columbia has now that seemed similar.  I like the style, appearance and fit.  However, the pockets are lined with some kind of thin synthetic mesh fabric that is very uncomfortable and sticks to your skin like Velcro if your skin is at all rough.  The main interior liner is fine, so why didn't they use the same fleece-like material in the pockets?  This is really annoying, thus the 3-star rating on an otherwise nice jacket."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Nice jacket,3,"The jacket was ok, but I didn't care for the cut of the shoulders.  Too restrictive for my 50"" chest.  It's not quite a slim fit, but somewhere between slim and standard.  I think it would have been great for traveling, but I had to return it because it fit my big frame awkwardly.  If you wear standard sizes, I think you will like it a lot."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great lightweight jacket!,5,I like Columbia jackets because they come in tall sizes. Being 6’6” it can be hard to find a jacket that fits right. A 4XLT is the perfect fit for me.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great looking jacket,3,"Great looking jacket, but I had to return because, as usual, Columbia's sizes get pretty inconsistent out toward the far end of the spectrum (4XB/4XLT). Whenever I find one of their products that fits, hope springs eternal that there are more out there on the shelves, but I've been disappointed before."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Buy this jacket,5,"Size 4X. A 5'10"" 325lb dude. Jacket has a fleece type lining, a good overall length, and good lengthy sleeves. A great buy. Live in SC so winter isn't harsh, but it gets a bit cold sometimes. 40 degrees and breezy tonight, and I'm definitely warm."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great Gift for the man in your life.,5,The jacket length overall was a great fit for my boyfriend. The product fits true to size or a little larger. Chest and waist fit great on him. Didn’t look too Bulky.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Awesome coat, just double check your sizing.",4,"Love the jacket overall, just get the size you normally wear. I bought one size up based on reviews about how it fit, big(!) mistake. I'm 6'1"", 345lbs., 37"" sleeve, 56"" chest and 48"" waist. I bought a 4x, the sleeves are too long, it's comfortably loose in the shoulders, the chest is too roomy, the waist is way too big. It keeps me warm on frosty mornings, and so far sheds rain quite nicely. At least I have room for layers if needed. Hope this helps."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Love Columbia!,5,"This jacket is wonderful....comfortable, fits great, looks great and wears so well, I bought another.  I travel every week on business and this is a great jacket to carry with me at all times.  Absolutely love it, as I do most things Columbia produces.  The quality is phenomenal!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,A good light jacket.,4,"It fit a bit on the large size.  I first had ordered a Large, like my old Columbia fleece, and it was just too baggy. I sent it back for a Medium and that fit better (I am 5' 8"" and about 190 lbs).  It keeps me warm a bit better than my fleece and certainly keeps me drier when it rains.  Some had commented that it kept out the wind.  That is not what I experienced, as I could feel it when there was a stiff breeze out.  I do wish that the jacket had an inside pocket."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Nice jacket with a couple caveats,4,"I normally wear a medium, but with reading some reviews (and a better price on the small than on the medium) I tried the small and now have to return it and order a size up.  The small fit fine in the shoulders and arm length was great, but the torso was too small.  It seems to be a bit V-shaped down to the waist.  I have a slim build and my shoulders aren't broad (6 ft tall, 155 lbs), but this just didn't look good on.  I'll have to try the medium and re-review this to get more info on fit.As for the color and material, those are great.  The color is a true grey and very nice.  The material is a nice smooth exterior and thin fleece lining.  Should be wind and light rain resistant.  I'm not a fan of the velcro on the cuffs, but maybe I could get used to it.  It has two ""hidden"" interior pockets that are nice and large (no closure on them), and the exterior pockets are also nice and large with zippers.  Finish and stitching were all very good."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,I LOVE THESE JACKETS!!!!!!!!!,5,"these are the only jackets i will weir. Water proof, wind proof and tuff an hell. I bought one 16 years ago and its still holding up. I have 3 of these."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Nice look and fit,5,"Great jacket bought cause I don’t like a bulky jacket for winter.  Fits nice and can wear in the car driving. Also held well in snow,  didn’t need to put in dryer after shoveling"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great quality jacket,5,Columbia makes great products of which I have several. This one is water & wind resistant. Tested it today in the rain. The water beads right off it like a charm. It's lined with fleece and pretty warm too. Nice deep pockets and the colored zippers add some good contrast. The jacket fits great and is of excellent quality. Very happy with my purchase.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Excellent value for what it is,5,"Larger than expected, very warm, very thin materials. Questionable how it will handle rain or weather events besides the cold. So far warmer than needed at 34 degrees when pair with a knit hat (YMMV), no problem recommending to others when alternatives are close to double the price."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Love this jacket and maybe its not Columbias fault but ...,4,"Love this jacket and maybe its not Columbias fault but it is a little too short on my 6'8 frame. Im 6'8 and packed to the gills with awesomeness. I wasn't sure this was going to zip and it does, not that I would, probably too dangerous. Sleeve length and shoulders are perfect. At 6'8 its hard to find a quality decent looking jacket that isn't short. But if you don't posses as much awesomeness as I, this jackets a great buy!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Nice,5,"Really nice jacket. It is water resistant to an extent, very comfortable, and looks awesome. It does run a bit small, but it's still a good fit. I am 6'3"" 300lb and wear a 2X tall. This is my favorite all purpose jacket."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Super high quality,5,"I have no idea why this was half the price of the other Ascender jackets on Amazon (maybe this color was last season). It's an authentic Columbia jacket. Super high quality. Fits as expected. Contemplating purchasing a second one, just because of the price."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Great jacket, perfect for tall guys!",5,"Great jacket!  I prefer soft shell jackets for their comfort, this one is understated in its styling but has the essential features I expect in a jacket of this style (bottom pull cords, velcro wrist straps, zippered pockets with external breast pocket). I would say the jacket is 97% wind proof, and the waterproof coating makes water just bead on the surface (instead of soak in). It's kept me dry in moderate rain and wind, and warm in weather down to about 20 degrees Fahrenheit (when paired with gloves, a hat, and a long sleeve thermal underneath).The best part is the fit, I'm 6'4"" about 205lbs and wear a 36/37"" sleeve.  This jacket is slim fit with perfect length over my torso, not too bulky, and arms are great length.The only con I can think of- I wish it had an internal breast pocket with earphone pass-through, but its a small nit pick and it still deserves 5 stars.  I would definitely buy again."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Nice Fall/Spring jacket!,4,"Great jacket for the money.  The fit on me is pretty much what you see in the picture.  I'm 6'3, 215lbs, and I ordered the large.  Color is spot on, and the material is great for 40-65 degrees F.  It starts getting a bit warm at around 70.  It's lighter than my Carhartt. which is great for light use, maneuvering in the car, etc. but it also isn't a very tough jacket.  For the money, it's decent, but I don't think it will last more than a couple of seasons."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Sleeves just a smidge too short, but great jacket other wise if you have short limbs.",4,"Love the color, love the jacket, great fit around the mid section.  My only complaint, the sleeves are about an inch to short.  Granted I have fairly long arms and limbs in general, my curse, but I would rather have an extra inch of material than be short an inch.  I hope that Columbia can either correct this, or I would settle for being pointed in the right direction to finding a longer one, because I enjoy this jacket."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"The XL for my chest and shoulders perfect, which means it runs true to size but ...",5,"I wear a 2XL tall in most stuff. I dropped by a local academy and tried on both a 2X an XL of the Ascender normal fit. The XL for my chest and shoulders perfect, which means it runs true to size  but larger than most off the rack clothes I find. The tall for my arms perfectly and the hem is just long enough to cover your pants pockets. I was surprised but the tall had more wrist room as well (its Velcro adjustable anyway but the XL regular is a little snug on my wrists)"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,This is an all around great jacket to own.,5,The jacket is fairly warm and acts as both a wind breaker as well as a rain jacket.  It reflects water nicely. My favorite jacket to own.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Comfortable,5,Perfect for mid range temps of 40-60.Can keep you warm and not to hot!Lite weight and comfortable.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Nice fit great price!!!,5,"I tried it on at local retail.I'm a XL or XXL.So I got XXl.I live in Cleveland,Ohio area.I wanted some more stylish than my Carthart and My 2 H-D Leather Jacket with patches.There is room enough to fit a light to heavy hoodie under it.It was a tough choice this color or Dark Back Country (Green). I might ask the wife for the green one for b-day/xmas gift.I  looked at North Face Apex Bionic.I liked it ,but with this Columbia it just like it,Yet $60-$100 I saved."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,This Jacket was Perfect for my special man,5,This Jacket was Perfect for my special man! He usually has a problem with the arm lengths.. Nope this fits him just perfect.. Its nice enough to go out and be in the cold and not have to be bundled up lightweight yet keeps him warm...Was impressed and I will pass that along to others! Got it on sale so that made it even better lol.. Thank you
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Best soft shell in town,5,"I love the jacket, it’s clearly made of quality material, looks great and everything but for some reason even though it looks like it fits perfect it feels like it’s too big lol. It’s the weirdest thing. Anyway i will be buying another one these things  are way cheaper than a north face jacket with comparable build quality."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,I am satisfied,5,Very comfortable and quality. Thanks to the manufacturer and Amazon for the excellent price
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great size,3,I am 6.4 Tall.217 LBAverage body type.This jacket fits great. After many years I finally found oneOne big issue: the zipper has defects. I replaced 3 times. When you zip up it opens from the bottom. So I am not sure why Columbia picked the cheapest zippers for these products
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Love it,5,I got the large tall. I’m 6 foot 240lbs fairly fit. More athletic built. It fits me perfectly. This is my second one of these jackets. I got one for work and one for outside of work. Keeps me warm during Georgia winters.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Not as sturdy as we thought.,2,My husband really liked this jacket- it fit him really well and was a good quality... until the first wash. He followed the label and the zipper came right off. We returned it for a refund.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,nice jacket,4,"Im 6' 3.5"" tall 218 lbs .44"" chest ..34-35"" waist ..long arms..large tall fit me perfect ..nice jacket ....hope this helps other buyer"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Quality and Style are Supreme,5,This is a great lightweight jacket that feels and looks quality!
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Nice coat,5,"3x was to small, 4x just a bit to large.  Overall I like the coat.  Fashionable and warm."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great fit,5,"I often have to send jackets and coats back because I have long arms. If I go up to big in size, the jacket usually leaves far to much space in the body. If I fit the body, the arms are too short.  I'm 6'3'' with 38 inch arms and average to athletic size in the upper body. This is about the best fit I've had for a jacket. Light weight jacket good for 40 - 55 degrees or so. Nice style."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Great jacket, and a better price than from Columbia direct!",5,"The material on the outer shell is soft but resilient.  My daughter spilled ice cream with hot fudge on it, and it wiped right off with water and a clean rag.  The jacket is warm, but not too warm.  I have worn it in 25+ degrees Fahrenheit and it was very comfortable.  It does a good job of repelling rain and snow, but I have not tested prolonged exposure.  It kept me dry for a walk of about 10 city blocks, so that's good for what I need.  I would definitely buy another one when this one has worn out it's usefulness, but I don't think that will be for some time.  It is very well made."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,They're great for an array of weather conditions,5,"We purchased two of these jackets, each in a different color, and they have held up quite well over the past two years. They're great for an array of weather conditions, make an excellent mid layer, and are extremely comfortable. I wear mine with long and short sleeve t-shirts, button downs, and even under a rain coat without any issue. The only downside that's worth mentioning is how the fleece lining sometimes pulls long sleeves up while putting the jacket on, but that's more of an occasional annoyance and doesn't even warrant a reduction in star rating."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,A+,5,"Really happy with this jacket, super cheap, fast delivery and fit perfectly."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Gift for Husband,5,It was perfect for him! He had another jacket he loved but the zipper broke. So I bought this Columbia one. He is a tall guy. So glad I bought it. He seems very happy with it!
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Just not the same quality,1,"I have an exact same jacket in black, 4 years old, still going good. Purchased this Columbia jacket, everything seems the same, but is little loose, little less warm and the main zip and pocket zips are evidently cheap. Main zip today broke after 3 weeks of use, and now the jacket is of no use. Need to figure out, how to return this thing."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Bought 1 for son... Then 1 for Husband!,5,"Bought 3xl for husband & 2xt for 6’3” son. Husband loves that cuffs are adjustable (he’s not tall, so everything is long on him). Offspring loves that his wrists don’t show. Total win!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"2xlt 6’4, 205 lbs",4,The first jacket i ordered had a bad zipper. But the replacement works fine. My husband is 6’4 and around 205 lbs. he needs tall length in his jackets and all his clothes. This jacket was perfect . A little large but he likes it that way
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,For the big boys,5,Great jacket. This review is for the big boys. I am big and tall. The size and flexibility of the material is perfect. So get your actual size because they don't run small.  I recommend this jacket for the big guys
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,This 2xl jacket runs small order a size up,4,I have had 3 of these jackets. They are all Columbia Ascender softshell jackets in 2xl. I purchased this jacket to have  another color. This jacket is extremely small for a 2xl. It fits like a large. NOTE!! I received a 3xl it fits perfect!!!
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Golf Jacket,4,"Not Wind proof, 3 layers and still felt the cold winter wind blowing through me on the golf course, so I bought WOOL Long John's, waiting to use those to help play winter golf."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,It fits true to size.....,4,"I bought it in a size larger, thinking it runs small, based on a previous Columbia jacket I had. It fits true to size, so its a little loose, but keeping it. I can add extra thick layer underneath."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,but 2X will fit me like 90% of the time,5,"I am a big guy, 5 foor 8 and 330 pounds. I can wear some XL shirts, but 2X will fit me like 90% of the time. This jacket is just a tad too small, but it's not enough to make me deduct a star. The quality is amazing, the zippers have never had a problem, and the color is great. I want a couple more!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Good Quality,5,"Been using this for a couple of years, one of my favorite jackets. Hasn't shown any signs of falling apart yet, hope that it continues to hold up to my abuse because I love the thing."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Thin jacket that keeps you warm.,5,This is my second Columbia jacket (Both are the same exact Jacket).  1st jacket i had for over ten years.  Great jacket that is lite weight and keeps the wind and cold off you.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Needed a tall for longer arms but great jacket.,5,Great jacket. Super comfortable but Too small for a tall guy. Arms way too short. I returned and got tall size and it is wonderful. Wish it was available in tall on amazon.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,anothergood quality product from columbia,4,good light jacket just what i needed for fall and winter at work. i work graveyard making deliveries and run alot so this is not to warm. well made and good quality materials and zippers. i have a columbia fleece that is 3xt and fits just right this is just a little bigger so a 2xt would be just right. dont order big for this.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Almost perfect,4,"Fits as expected, works well in a light rain and is warm. My only complaint is the cords on the bottom to sinch the jacket get snagged offten on everything. A small Velcro strip could prevent this problem."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,He loves it and wears it on cool days. Perfect for Florida winters,5,Got for my dad for Christmas.  He loves it and wears it on cool days.  Perfect for Florida winters.  Lightweight but warm.  He is a building contractor and is outside a lot but this transitions well from site to office.  He is 6'3 and 230 wears a 48 coat.  Athletic slim build.  Got him a xl long and fits great.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great fit!,5,"I’m 6’5” and (currently) 230, and this fits great! It’s just a little snug in the shoulders, but no complaints! Definitely will fit perfectly after I lose 10-15lbs!"

Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Hard on size,4,"I just received this jacket and i love it, it is a lot cheaper than buying it off the Columbia website.  I just wanted to share that it does run a little small. I usually wear a 3x in womens and people said it ran kind of big so i ordered a 3x since its a mens size but its to tight when zipped. overall, its a really nice jacket"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Finally Something that Fits,5,"My son is tall (6'7"") but he is thin (165 lbs).  Everything I find is for Big AND Tall and swallows his small frame.  This coat is a perfect find!  The price was amazing.  I hope to be able to find more things to fit him in the future."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Worth every penny,5,The fit and look were exactly as I expected them to be. Columbia knows what they’re doing.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Husband loved it,5,Ordered a 2xl and it fit perfectly. My husband loves that its not fleece and not a heavy material that he would sweat to death in.  No issues at all.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,I am very pleased with the overall fit of the coat,5,"The Columbia large tall is a stylish coat that fits my 6' 4"" frame well. My sleeve length for shirts is 37/38, and the sleeves on the coat are exactly the correct length for me. I am very pleased with the overall fit of the coat, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to others. I would definitely purchase this item again."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great jacket 6,5,I like it.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Well made jacket.,5,"Well made jacket.  This jacket is consistent with the high expectations of quality from Columbia. It is a warm jacket and I am looking forward to wearing it this fall. So far, the weather has not been cool enough to wear a jacket of this caliber."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,nice jacket,5,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. He likes this jacket a lot.  Same qualities as North Face and Patagonia, without the heavy sticker price. well made, warm, and a lot of colors to choose from. will buy in the future, looking now for my husband and younger son."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Nice product.,5,"Very nice product.  It was a Christmas gift.  But the person didn't like it, so I returned it."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Some damage,4,"Ordered it and arrived on time, no problem there. Packaging in great condition and looked like it was handled properly, no problem there. After wearing it for about a day or 2, I noticed a dark blue ink smudge on the inside near top of zipper. Definitely wasn't my doing so must of arrived in that condition looked ""fresh"" by that I mean it doesn't look like someone tried to cover it up. I love the jacket and will keep wearing it."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Shipped used jacket with stains,1,Loved the jacket! Disappointed with the condition it was in. Stains on the sleeves and front. Fabric inside the collar was pilled up like it was a used item. I am re-ordering the same jacket hoping I actually get a new one this time.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Zipper Broke after only 3 weeks of Wearing it!,1,"I bought this jacket in October for a Christmas Gift for one of my sons.  It's the exact maroon of his school colors.  He's worn it for less than a month and the zipper broke.  Since I bought at the end of October, the return date has expired so now I have  a winter jacket in Boston, MA that can't zip.  I will never purchase another Columbia product."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Little short but otherwise fits great!,5,I have a tall torso so it might be me. But it was a little short. Its right at my belt line and I personally prefer it to be longer but I love it and as a big guy its hard to find things that fit. Hopefully as I lose weight the length gets better. I use this at work as a security guard and I love it because it's not too bulky. I hope you find this helpful.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Love this brand of jacket!!!!,5,I like to buy my husband this brand of jacket. The fit is perfect and it is warm also. You always know that it is going to be a well made garment. I usually purchase more than one because the price is right.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Very nice product, fits larger than I expected.",5,Really nice quality jacket that works for a variety of weather. It did fit a little bigger than I expected. I am somewhere between a large and x-large when it comes to most shirts and jackets. I purchased the x-large and it seemed larger than my other x-large jackets.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Perfect Fit,5,"The jacket arrived as advertised. Nice color, perfect fit. Great quality."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,I'm questioning whether it is truely a Columbia product.,2,"Seemed like a nice coat upon receipt. At first wash, there were gray stains that appeared around several of the seams. Washed a second time and most of them seemed to have gone away. I wore it for a few weeks and when I washed it again, several more of the gray stains reappeared."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Like the quality of Columbia!,5,I ordered this jacket for my husband as a Christmas gift. It’s a very attractive jacket. He has not worn it yet; I’ll know more about fit after he receives it for Christmas. I’m pleased with the look of this jacket.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Good fit,5,Best fall jacket. Have it in two colors and fits perfectly.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great Product and Value!,4,Very good value and very well made. It fits a little on the large side in the chest which is fine as I will most probably be wearing a sweater or vest underneath. This is a much better product than the Eddie Bauer or North Face models and the price for my size was a bargain in comparison.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,(And I think my arms are pretty average. ) Freedom of movement is significantly affected,2,The jacket seems OK for warmth but the sleeves were too narrow for me. (And I think my arms are pretty average.) Freedom of movement is significantly affected.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Consistent Columbia Jacket,4,"Consistent, this was a replacement for a previous one I own. The older one was awesome and not retired, but being updated for this one. I noticed ""Omnishield"" is not on the top of cuff like before. It seems thinner, but it may be technology. I will know in the coming cold weather."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Not a jacket, more like a windbreaker",3,"This is not a jacket. To me it is a windbreaker. It has very little insulation so it not suitable for wearing in cold weather. Fit was good. I am 6' 4"" with size LT. The neck is too small though. I can't zip the zipper above my neck."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Good against cold,5,"Haven't had bad weather to put it to the true test, but very comfortable and keeps you warm at night."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Columbia Ascender Softshell Jacket,4,"I like the jacket very much. It looks great, fits perfectly, XXL  (I am 6'2 235 lbs) with plenty of room for an additional layer,and  is very waterproof. It's not very warm if worn alone in cooler weather but that's ok as I wasn't expecting it to. That's not why I bought it. I looked at the North Face Apex Bionic but the sleeves were to short, not to mention double the price."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,A bit too loose,4,"Nice design and warm, it fits a bit too loose and sleeves are a bit to long.I’ll keep the item because I like the color and quality.I believe that the smaller size would be to small."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great jacket,5,For the guy who wants  a tall jacket this is the perfect choice
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,A must have.,5,"While it's a tad more expensive than other types, it's definitely worth it. I test this jacket in 8+ hours of continuous pouring rain, only to find I was still warm AND dry the whole time."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great for big & tall!,5,"I'm 6ft 1 and the issue I have with buying coats at the store is that they always end up being too short in length and the sleeves seem to stop above my wrists. After researching I decided to go with Columbia's ""tall"" jacket. So glad I did, it actually fits me. The quality is great, it works well if I'm going casual or dressed up. Nice coat, great quality!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great price,5,Jacket is great !  Fits well and was priced extremely well!!!
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,great waterproofing. i have been showing this off to ...,5,"update 3/22/2017: so i've had this over a year and its still a great jacket. great wind breaker still has water repellant properties as in water rolls off the jacket b4 being absorbed for the most part. the only problem is i'm fatter than a year ago so its snug. but ive washed it in the washer before. i luv the pockets and zips for the pockets. no hoodie but the collar is tall to help protect your neck a bit. the fleece is a bit thin so i feel the cold when sitting out in the 40degree weather a bit. and its a very snug for me so i can't fit a sweater or layers under it but i recommend getting size larger if you plan on putting a few layers under unless you're pretty skinny. i'm more plump so its snug. but i like the fit and shape it kinda slims my chest and belly a bit.but thinking about getting a larger one maybe another color to be able to wear extra sweaters or layer it for really cold weather :) still 5 starsgreat waterproofing. i have been showing this off to customers and friends and family i go to their sink and put my arm under the water and put on full blast for 10seconds and all the water rolls off.very light so its great for places like Houston where its not exactly cold compared to most of the country... so this makes a nice and ""warm"" windbreaker and rain jacket without getting too too hot but can get warm in 70 degree houston humidity warm weather. but those cool days we get that are sunny its great. u may need to remove in the car or just put a lil ac on on those 70 plus days that are sunny so cars are hot but i'm loving this as spring jacket. the windbreaker and rain resistance is worth it here...thats me though. i can get cold quick and  i've noticed in those below 60 degree days (thats winter time here in houston btw) i'm still chilly in this. but throw a sweater on underneat and the windbreaker shield with the thin fleece and under clothing start trapping heat real good and keep u warm.  at that point i get annoyed cuz the rest of my body is cold like legs and face!my biggest disappointment with this jacket is that it has a tall collar they couldve easily have thrown in a thin shell material detachable hoodie  that maybe tucks into the collar or hav a 3 button attachment. even if it isn't fleece lined the thin material is some water and wind breaker resistance on those windy cold days or if tucked into the collar it can make neck warmer.i'm around 5'6"" - 5'7"" so i order a medium which was great the arms were long enough too but i'm over 200lbs and at 5'7"" that means i'm above average weight and lil chunky,  and it was really tight. but i could see guys who are taller than me but skinnier buying this and fitting it perfectly fine. i'm not sure about 6' tall guys but they may even like the medium if you're skinny guy like 180lbs of US weight or below, i'm guessing. I could zipper it but I looked like i had a small girlfriend and i was wearing her clothes or something lol. so i sent this in for a large which fits my fatter stomach and it holds perfectly (lil tight on my stomach but room ) so if you rmid to upper 5foot tall range and heavier like 200 or above and expect a fitted jacket thats tight in some areas, this is PERFECT fit.I expected this to fit a lil tightly so up in my shoulders and arm area they are a lil tight but i have just about full range but that shape is slimming and is supposed to be ""FIT"" therefore someowhat type. and that is my preference so for me this is perfect. i love the color dark black with nice tron light blue! yes i used TRON to explain the decorative color style of this jacket get over it loli know this doesn't come with hoodie but really upset they dont offer an affordable all around i would so minus .5 a star for that but i knew the jacket didn't come with it but on amazon prime and free 2day shipping and quick return of money next day when  i shipped my first medium jacket back with no hassle, can't beat price and service!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Light weight but very warm!,5,The jacket fit is perfect. I am a big guy - size 3X with a longer torso. It fits perfectly with the bottom of the coat coming down to just below my belt. Sleeves are little long but the adjustable cuff secures the sleeves at the wrist while allowing you to reach without your wrist becoming exposed. The jacket is light weight but blocks wind repels light rain well. Very warm for the jacket weight. Very pleased with my purchase.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,A little long for me as I'm a shortie,4,I would have liked if they had more size options. Smaller in length but same size at the chest and waist. The material is good though so I'm keeping it.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Fit is PERFECT.,5,"My husband loves this jacket! He is a very tall, very thin man (he's 6 ft. 7) and it's very tough for him to find jackets that fit him length wise and width wise simultaneously. He bought a large and it fits him perfectly. He works outside at night and was searching for a non bulky jacket to keep him warm and this does the job!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Fashion, comfort and warmth",4,"Great multi season coat. Very sharp color comboSomewhat finicky  main zipper- could have been bigger and sturdier,and the side and front pocket zippers are just fineOtherwise I love itWater beads up on the outer surface."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great Jacket,5,I love these coats and they are good for pretty much any weather. Living in the Pacific Northwest this is the only jacket I wear for winter and fall. It keeps me warm enough to not have to wear any bulky jackets and it looks good.I used to wear a large but due to losing a massive amount of weight in 5 months I had to buy a medium and both fit perfect. These do not hug your body like the North Face softshell does but that is what I wanted. I used the North Face Apex Bionic for a year and I would choose this jacket over that one any day. The cost is also half of what you would pay and the quality is pretty much the same. Water wicks off of it but if there is heavy rain I would wear a different jacket. The black/azul looks really good and you do not see many of them out there. People are always asking where I got it from. Highly recommended.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,This jacket will keep you warm and dry,5,This jacket is very stylish and keep you warm and dry from the rain I have a lot of Columbia jackets and they’re very high-quality and last and very comfortable
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,DO IT !!!!!,4,Very accommodating jacket.  Fit runs small.  Order next size up.  I normally wear a large and had to order an X-Large for proper fit.  Otherwise the jacket is fantastic for casual wear and cold days.  It's durable and the material does not pill-up.  Major selection of colors.  I've always had good experiences with Columbia products.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Son loved it!,5,"One of three Columbia jackets I ordered for my son.  I was assuming he would select one of the three but he kept them all!  My son is particular, and usually buys expensive brands from REI so I wasn't sure he'd like the Columbia brand. This is a sharp looking jacket with a very nice fabric.  He has cats, and cat hair doesn't stick to this.  We think the blue zippers are a nice touch."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Good for Southern Winters and Northern Autumns,5,Love this jacket.  Plenty warm for winters in the south (Atlanta) and would probably work for my northern brothers up until Thanksgiving-ish.  Fabric blocks wind but still breathes well.  Repels rain extremely well and is well constructed.  I like how the collar stands up.  I haven't used the adjusters around the bottom (don't need to) but they seem like good quality.  Zippers are all good and the chest pocket fits a bigger phablet well.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,I love this jacket,5,"Let me start by saying, I love this jacket! It is surprisingly warm and does a great job of repelling rain and snow. It feels just a little big on me (I am 6ft, 200 lbs and bought a Large) but I'm sure a Medium would be too small. The pockets are deep set and the jacket itself is very lightweight. I like it so much that I'm thinking I may get one in Graphite as well!"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Comfortable, warm, and sleek",5,"I purchased this to replace my aging North Face shell that was starting to look a bit tattered. This was a great purchase. Much cheaper than the North Face, but the exact same quality, a lightly better fit, and just as good looking. I bought the Buffalo color, which is a really nice dark brown. Not boring black like so many others, and works with any choice in clothing."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,great Jacket,5,"great fit, great look,  great price"
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Awesome,5,Love this jacket! It's comfortable & stylish. I get a surprising amount of compliments on the color (shark).
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,great jacket,5,Product is exactly as described.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great jacket for cool fall season,5,"Great jacket for fall season, it fits perfectly."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,but it's a great jacket so I bought another one,5,"Had a red(rocket?) jacket for 3 years. Wore a few holes in the pockets, but it's a great jacket so I bought another one. Flame color is me orange than expected.Overall pretty warm. Large pockets. Doesn't have a good lining for winter but over a sweatshirt it's fine perfect in autumn and spring."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Weather Tough,5,"Great Jacket, withstood Colorado weather pretty good. Was wearing nothing else other than a T-shirt underneath and it managed to keep me pretty warm at 15F*. Took rain, Snow and windy weather like a champ. Would definitely purchase again."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great Jacket,5,"This is my third different Columbia coat/jacket. The water resistance is great. I'm 6'5"" and the XLT is perfect for me. I really like the sleeve length because I have long arms and it's sometimes sleeve length is neglected when tall size items are made. Would definitely recommend for a great fall/spring jacket. The color I purchased, Boulder, was as pictured (medium gray)."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Love love this jacket!!!!!,5,I ordered a TALL.  Love it!!  I have 4 of these jackets! The sleeves are long which I love.  I am a woman who is 5’8” so impossible to find long sleeves in women’s jackets.  The body goes to the top of my thighs!  Just perfect! My favorite jacket!  I wear it in the winter too. I highly recommend!  Warm and lightweight!
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great Columbia Quality!,5,Very nice color and material. Perfect for my son who hates a balky winter jacket. I wish it had inside pockets but I guess you can't have it all.  I bought a size medium to get a couple years wear out of it and  it was a true medium fit. The Velcro strap around the cuff helps to keep the sleeve from coming over my son's hand. Great price and would highly recommend.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Don’t expect a high quality jacket for a less price.,3,I thought the shell would be a little bit thicker like my old one. But is made cheaper and thinner. Not as wind resistant as my old one. But the price was fitting for the quality of the jacket.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Nice jacket,5,Nice fit. Clean look. Everything I expected.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,All purpose jacket,5,I love this jacket! It fits great and is really  comfortable. It’s also surprisingly warm! I wore in 18 Deg F weather and it kept warm!
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,A+,5,A+
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Good for the money.,3,"Some of the seams are picking after a couple months, but it still works for my needs."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Fits well... very thin,3,"The fit of this jacket (for Medium) is perfect. It looks good and the color (Petrol Blue) is great. However the jacket doesn't have too much to protect from cold. The material is very thin. The top pocket is place horizontally, so storing a phone is a bit odd."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Satisfied with the jacket.,5,"I like the size and the fit of the jacket. The sleeves are a little to long in the 4xl for me, but I am glad that sleeves have adjustable straps so the long sleeves is not a real issue. Overall I am very satisfied with this jacket. I may order 2 more in the future for the family and friends."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"5 stars, Columbia made a winner",5,"Excellent jacket. Perfect for Autumn and Spring. It is exactly what one expects from Columbia. One thing it did not have was inside pockets. For me, that was fine as the outside pockets are nice and zippered."
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Great Jacket,5,For a thin jacket it is super warm! Really great look and definitely a steal for the price.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,Beautiful color,5,Gift for my son.  Absolutely wonderful jacket.  Very pleased.
Columbia mens Ascender Softshell Front-zip Jacket,"Mid-weight, better fit for cool to cold days than extreme cold.",4,"Love the jacket...  definitely mid-weight, but does very well at cutting the wind and providing some warmth. Love the pockets. I hate bulky jackets, so love the weight/size."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Fake Jacket,1,"The jacket I received is a fake.  I also ordered a tall to compared the lengths.  See pictures.  The tall jacket is on the left off the 1st 3 pics and the bottom on the last.  The fake jacket does not have Columbia embroidered, it is a sticker of some sort.  Also the tag on the inside is different as with the ""Omni-tech"" on the sleeve.  The fake jacket does not have ""Packable"" on the inside of the pocket.  The jacket appears nice and I would have not questioned its authenticity if I didn't have the tall jacket to compare.  I am returning it."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Columbia or Amazon couldn't verify counterfeit,1,"Based on the other reviews I couldn't verify if the item I received was authentic or counterfeit. I got a replacement and both items had a non embroidered chest logo, missing packable tag in the pocket, and a non diamond omnitech logo on the left sleeve.I called Columbia and the best they could do is verify that the product number on the tag matched the number in their system, which it did. They couldn't address the concerns listed above.I contacted Amazon and they also couldn't verify if the product was authentic or counterfeit and will open an investigation."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Nicely Made (and a word for you if you're on the L/XL line),5,"I am on the border of large and x-large with most my clothes (36"" give or take waist). From other reviews, I read it's a little big, so decided to size down and went for the large. It fits nice with a t-shirt underneath, but not a lot of extra room for my... ugh... expanded mid section.  With a fleece mid-layer, it's a bit snug me. So if you're right on that L/XL line in most your clothing due to an over-indulgence in yummy trail treats and plan to wear over thicker clothing, I'd go with the XL.  But if you plan to be using it as a summer raincoat over just a tee for hiking and so on (that's my plan with it), then I'd go with the L.  It's really that fine of a line for me."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,NOT Waterproof at all!!!,1,"I bought this to go hiking on the Inca trail in Peru.  Even though it was rainy season, luckily we had no rain.But, then I took it on a trip to NYC where I wore it during a rainstorm on the way to a house lunch.  Was dry for the 15 minute walk in light but steady rain.  Hung the jack up to dry.  When I went to put back on the jacket, the moisture had SOAKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH the entire jacket.  Like putting on a wet washcloth.  Very disappointing.The jacket looks nice, feels well, but most sincerely very NOT WATERPROOF AT ALL.Never washed or did anything with jacket.Seller:  If you think I got a bum jacket, please let me know.  Would try another to see if works."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great jacket!!,5,"My husband loves this jacket. It is actually waterproof. My husband mountain bikes as a hobby and he volunteers to build the trails. Rainy days are the best trail building days and he said this jacket kept him completely dry while he was working in the rain for hours. On sizing if you are barely a large size down to a medium. The large runs big. My husband is 5'10"" 170lbs and medium fits him perfect. The large fit my brother inlaw perfectly and he is 6' 220lbs for reference."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Incrediblé jacket,5,"Had this jacket for about a month now and all I can say is it's awesome! Perfect for rain and a pretty damn good wind breaker as well. I can't say it's completely waterproof because I haven't been in a monsoon rainstorm but it's kept me dry for every other rain storm. Also it packs up so if you don't need it right now but maybe later for like a camping trip or something you can pull it out and put it on.Instructions: the left pocket has a label inside that says ""packable"" turn that guy inside out and stuff the rest of the jacket on in there.About the size of a normal picture 6""x4"" and the width of maybe 3-4"" probably depends on how well you stuff it in there. Hope this helps!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,More Than a Rain Jacket,5,"A Review of the Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain JacketThe Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain Jacket is a lightweight waterproof jacket with a slim design. As the name suggests, the jacket is very much capable of keeping you dry on a rainy day; however, its value goes way beyond a rain coat. Here are several features that make this jacket a wonderful addition to your wardrobe.Waterproof and WindproofThis jacket is truly waterproof. It helps you stay clean and dry even in the pouring rain. With the waterproof technology comes the wonderful stain repellent feature. No matter how dirty the jacket gets during a rainy day, a simple wipe is enough to take care of it. The windproof feature provides an extra protection against the cold. Meanwhile, the fabric is still breathable that it allows moisture vapor to move away from the skin. The only downside is that the waterproof feature can post difficulty when it comes to washing this jacket. You may find a pouch of water when you take it out of the washer. An extra cycle of drying will take care of the issue if this ever occurs.DesignThis jacket is lined with a soft layer of mesh and is very light weight. The longer arm length and body length provide enough coverage to keep you dry no matter how hard the wind is blowing. The hood comes out far enough forward to shield your face while the drawstring helps keep the hood on even in strong wind. Two front pockets with zipper are big enough to protect a phone, a wallet, a set of keys, and even a pair of gloves from getting rained on. The slim design delivers a more modern look than its competitors, helping you keep the style even on an awfully crummy day. Meanwhile, the jacket is still generous with space around your chest so that you always have enough room for a sweater or a hoodie or even a coat. Another notable feature is that the entire jacket can be packed into the front left pocket, which comes with a double-sided zipper.VersatilityFew jackets are as versatile as this one. The waterproof and windproof features make this jacket practically perfect for a fishing trip. The breathable fabric makes sure that you can throw this jacket over your favorite tee on a rainy day in the middle of the summer. You can also layer up under this jacket for fall or winter use. The matt finish and the slick look ensure that no one knows you are using a rain jacket as a spring/fall windbreaker. You can also use this jacket to protect your pea coat from getting wet on a snow day.Overall, the Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain Jacket is a high quality jacket that can be worn in many occasions. It surely has room for improvements. But for the price you are paying, you can hardly find a better deal than this."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,It's waterproof and keeps the wind out while being lightweight.,5,"I bought this jacket for my husband who is 5'10' and about 200 lbs.  It's a bit roomy as I wanted him to be able to fit a fleece jacket under it when needed.  It is loose enough without being baggy to look good with or without the fleece.  He's worn it a bit likes the feel and says it keeps the wind out.  It finally rained to test out the waterproof part - it's waterproof all right!  We stood out in the rain about 4 hrs, some of it was drizzle, most a steady rain. His shirt was dry when he took the jacket off.  His only wish was the hood was a bit stiffer at the top.  He said it kind of plastered around his head instead of creating a hood that stood out a bit.  His solution is to get a baseball hat and that will keep the rain off his face.  I would buy it again for sure!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Doesn’t appear authentic,1,"The jacket doesn’t appear to be authentic. It doesn’t have Columbia embroidered on the front and the sleeve like as on an original, it is more like a iron onto shirt like sticker of some sort. Also the tag on the inside is different like a general cloth label which doesn’t have the Columbia brand and QR code like on the original. Same goes for the ""Omni-tech"" on the sleeve. This jacket does not have ""Packable"" pocket on the inside of the left pocket with a label. Also like many customers reviewed, these jackets are oversized. Maybe good for people who live in colder climate wearing layers. For petiole living in temperate climate areas I would suggest you order one or two size smaller. This The jacket appears nice but I would not have paid this much if I wanted a regular unbranded jacket."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Authentic Columbia, I own 2",5,"Rumors of counterfeit had me wondering but I can confirm that this is an authentic Columbia watertight2, I called Columbia and was told it was probably fake because of lack of inside pocket and certain numbers so I kept the amazon jacket and ordered another one directly from Columbia and guess what, This is not a fake, Columbia no longer embroiders the name or puts inside pockets on this jacket, the 2 jackets are identical 😃 I am roughly 6 feet 225 pounds, XLT fits loose which I wanted, XL fits snugger but still perfect if I’d get in shape, I recommend This as an authentic jacket for cheeeeap if you like the right color😄"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Iceland tested, traveler approved!",5,"I just returned from a trip to Iceland and Norway where I wore this jacket almost daily. It packs well and serves as a great windbreak layer as well as rain coat. Giving a two thumbs up. Welded seams and protected zipper kept me nice and dry, and since I'm on the short side was long enough to cover my derriaire. I'm a female 5'4 dress size 22W, I bought the 3x. Fit was pretty roomy but great for layering over a fleece vest or jacket for added warmth."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Amazing!,5,"I am very impressed with the quality of this jacket, it looks very elegant and I've gotten compliments on it already. Definitely will be buying more in the future!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,I gave it one star because it looks good and it's comfortable,1,"I gave it one star because it looks good and it's comfortable, as far as the water tight business not even close. I went to Alaska last week, wore that in a rain, and not a very hard rain and I got soaked everything in my pockets that was paper was ruined, if you're looking for rain gear this isn't it, I'll never buy Columbia for rain gear again"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Decent jacket, HORRIBLE company",1,"I strongly urge everyone to find a better business to spend your money with.After having this jacket for a few years, I noticed a small hole in the shoulder. I'm not sure how this happened, but it looked like it must have got it caught on something. Not wanting it to spread, I contacted Columbia to see if they had patches available or could recommend a product for me to repair it.Their response was to ask when and where I bought it. I gave them those details, and explained that it was not something I expected them to cover for me as it was not a product defect. Their response directed me to the warranty department anyway.I clicked the link they sent me, which had me fill out a form with all of the details of the jacket. The result of that was a warranty claim number and an address to which I should send the jacket to. I sent in my jacket and waited a few weeks. With an upcoming trip, I decided to follow up to find out if they knew when I might have the jacket back. This is where things went terribly off the tracks...Columbia has told me that since this is not a manufacturing defect, they cannot/will not repair it, and they are sending it back to me as-is. Further, the recommended a product that I can use to repair it myself (Gear Aid). So why did they have me send this in to them in the first place? I was very much up-front about it not being something I thought should be warrantied and simply wanted a product recommendation. Instead I spent $11 on shipping at their direction, and have been without my rain jacket for several unseasonably rainy weeks just to get the simple information I requested a month ago!Thanks for wasting my money and time Columbia. You have forever lost a customer. Once again, I strongly urge everyone to find a better business to spend your money with."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,not fake,4,"received the jacket, fits well. was concerned about the reviews mentioning it being a fake product.I contacted Columbia and asked about their logo's. their response was:We have started doing heat press for some of the logos because when they are embroidered small holes are made and it takes away from the jacket being waterproof."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Fake Jacket,1,"I got the same fake jacket as another reviewer. The fake jacket does not have Columbia embroidered like it shows in the pictures. Also the tag on the inside is different as with the ""Omni-tech"" on the sleeve. The fake jacket does not have ""Packable"" on the inside of the pocket. I am returning it."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Fake/Counterfeit,1,"This item had so many reviews that were mostly positive so I took a shot.  When I did look at the reviews, I saw many that said you may or may not get a fake.  Looking at my item once it arrived, I could easily tell it was fake.  Even the Columbia tag was a thin and paper like when it should be more like a glossy and thicker cardboard.  The Columbia insignia was ironed on as opposed to the embroidered photo and the iron-on showed a glue residue under it.  This would have easily came off in the rain.  Also omni tech on left sleeve was another iron-on and did not have the same logo displayed in photo.  Lastly, another reviewer said that omni tech tag should be in one of the pockets and it was not.  I don't mind non brand name items but I don't want  to pay for a brand to get a knock off.  Being that this appears to have been shipped and supplied by Amazon, they (Amazon) should be more aware if they are holding fakes in their inventory."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Might get the real thing, might get a fake.",1,"Jacket fits well and looks nice, but as soon as I pulled it out of the packaging something felt a bit off. The velcro on the cuffs looks like it wouldn't last long, which one of the strips on the sleeve not sewed on till the end of the velcro fabric (pictured). Also, the Omni Tech logo is completely different than what is pictured. To top it off, I took pictures of both pockets to show that ""packable"" is nowhere to be found.It does not seem like this jacket would pack into the pockets at all, I don't know if they are smaller than they should be or what. Definitely going to return unfortunately. Watch out, it's clearly a total toss up with this seller as to whether you will receive an authentic Columbia jacket, or a knock off."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Exactly what I was looking for.,5,"A light weight rain jacket that wouldn't create an interior sauna when the temp is above sixty degrees fahrenheit,  I usually walk three or more miles a daiy, except in rain when the temp is over 60 F.  I have a much more expensive gore-tex rain jacket, but it is just too damned hot in warm weather.  This fits my needs perfectly, plus it is light weight enough that I can hang from my belt loop when the storm is over and hike for miles hardly noticing it's weight .I have hiked now through several rainstorms with temps above 70 F and though it is warm, it is tolerable, unlike my gore-tex jacket.  I am more than pleased."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Nice but concerned about authenticity,3,"This is a nice lightweight rain jacked. It is unlined so won't do a whole lot to keep you warm but it will stop the rain and some wind from hitting you. My concern is that my jacket has some differences between what is pictured here and what I received. Other reviewers have posted similar issues, such as the logo being silkscreened instead of embroidered on the front. I also appear to be missing the stitched in pouch to fold it up. I'm not sure if I received a knockoff or if Columbia cut costs on newer production. At the price I picked it up for I decided to keep it and as long as it holds up I will be pleased. I will update this review if any issues arise."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,you will NOT get an original jacket DO NOT buy,1,"FAKE FAKE FAKE. DO NOT BUY. The pictures on amazon when you are going to buy the jacket show the original jacket, with all original corresponding logos. The back seams is also supposed to have 2 lines running horizontally, this one only has 1. The jacket I received is fake. I found many distinguishable marks between the online jacket and the one I got. The jacket on the amazon selling page is the original one but the one they are sending out isnt."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Not Fakes, just different",3,"I have the same issue as the other users stating that the product appears to be counterfeit. I ordered the jacket in graphite. Logos are iron on type, not embroidered. Interior liner is different. Quality overall of velcro seems very low. Omnitech logo does not have the diamond and there is no packable pocket tag or anything to be found. I'm returning this item and ordering from Columbia instead.EDIT - After returning this jacket and ordering the same one direct through Columbia's website, it appears it is not a fake. The Columbia jacket I received is identical to the one I received from my order through Amazon. It appears Columbia has changed how they are producing this jacket somewhere along the line which is where the discrepancies are coming into play."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Watertight II Updated Version,5,"Nice lightweight jacket. Made well, Fits well....Columbia has confirmed this is the latest Updated Version.Like others, the jacket I received Watertight ii did not have the embroidered logo. Called amazon and was prepared to send it back. On the way to drop it at UPS decided to run by Cabelas because I knew they had these jackets as well.Jacket I received was the exact same on the outside as what Cabelas were selling for $59. On the inside Cabelas had a interior pocket with zipper under a flap for storage, mine from amazon does not.Columbia's website states...Packable into hand pocket...Which mine from amazon will do.So, it seems there are different updated versions of this same jacket.I now feel confident that the one I purchased from amazon was genuine.Hope this helps."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,LEGIT and GREAT waterproof jacket,5,"I had to post this comment after reading the extremely misleading reviews some customers left saying that the jacket is a counterfeit based on the thermo-adhesive ""Columbia"" badge on the top left  and the thermo-adhesive ""Omni-Tech"" badge on the left  sleeve. WELL they are wrong!This is actually this exact same design you will find in official physical and online Columbia Stores. I've been there yesterday and the badges were thermo adhesive and not embroidered.For the rest the jacket is waterproof, light and fits great ! I'd say it fits smaller than other Columbia insulated jackets for example but it creates a great look. Love it !"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,edit up:  I bought another on for my partner.  They are that good.,5,"First off, i read all the reviews and took to heart that some said this jacket runs small, so i simply ordered a size larger. I am glad I did, as this allows me to layer up reasonably well underneath it.I am a letter carrier, and I walk 80% of my route out in the elements. Today (3/1/16) was the first consistently rainy day that I could test this jacket out, and it worked exactly as I hoped it would. I stayed completely dry all day long. I have used many of the various rain jackets made available to us as letter carriers over the years, and this by far bests them all. It is lighter than gortex and imo breaths much better, and performed just as well considering it kept me dry all day!!! The only mistake I made, was not wearing any rain pants with it, because water just rolls off this jacket, and wound up on my legs (doh! my mistake)I will be buying another one of these to keep in my truck. If i intended this for a summer weight only rain jacket, the fit would be fine, but i was looking for an alternative to the standard rain jackets the USPS offers us, which cost over 2x as much.  So i ordered a size up knowing id want to layer up underneath it.Bottom line, this a wonderful rain jacket, that does pack away in the stash pocket very well, in a small enough size to keep around anywhere."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Columbia Quality and Performance (but)...,5,"This jacket will keep you dry.  Columbia makes excellent products and this rain jacket is no exception.  ""Breathable"" makes a huge difference.A few things to note:1. The jacket I received has a normal fit (3XL).  I wouldn't say it fits too big or too small.2. The description includes a zippered chest pocket.  This is a misprint from the first Watertight jacket.  That jacket has a third pocket on the chest.  This Watertight II jacket does not... inside or out... no chest pocket.  I went to Columbia's website and their pictures also don't show the chest pocket, but lists it in their description (sent them a heads-up).3. The hood is adjustable with drawstrings, but doesn't have the velcro loop to roll-up the hood like the first Watertight jacket.4. Where the first Watertight jacket is packable into a pocket behind the main zipper, this Watertight II jacket is packable into either hand pocket.  There's a little label at the entrance of the left-hand pocket that says ""packable.""  Just put your hand into the pocket, pull it inside-out and pack the jacket into the inside-out pocket.  EZ.  You can zip it closed when you're finished, but it's a bit of a pain to unzip it because the zipper pull will be inside when it closed.It's a comfortable rain jacket and doesn't get hot inside while wearing it.  The chest pocket would've been nice for a cellphone or MP3 player; otherwise, I'm happy with it."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,GREAT & 100% Authentic - despite the other review,5,"This is an authentic Columbia jacket, despite what one review says. I called Columbia directly and they confirmed it.This is quite possibly the best money I've ever spent. I went through the Columbia sizing recommendations and purchased a 3XL - tall. It is super comfortable, 100% water proof (yes, unfortunately it's been tested several times), nearly 100% windproof, dries quickly and packs up completely in the pocket. I wore this over a Duluth Trading Shoreman's fleece winter jacket (my absolute go to!) during a fall lacrosse tournament in driving 31 degree rain. My DT jacket was completely dry underneath and it was the warmest combination I've ever experienced.I look forward to using this officiating lacrosse in the western NY ""spring"" weather, finally I'll be dry and comfortable."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"great wader jacket/outer shell, like its bigger “PFG” brother",5,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   awesome jacket. i’m 5’8”, 130 lbs, 34 chest and 30inch waist. the fit on this “small size” jacket is great. i picked this up to replace a old orange columbia pfg storm jacket. the arms are slightly bigger than the pfg which is great b/c the pfg was tighter around the arms, specially with layering.the pfg and this jacket i use mainly as a wading jacket, worn ontop of my waders for surf fishing. its so far held up great against the sand and salt and rain while fishing! it replaces an old pfg that has been tried and true for the past 4-5 years in rain and salt, but just recently been leaking this past season.for the 4-5 years i had that pfg, i didnt even know about the “packable” pocket lol! much like the pfg, all i really need is just a sweater or hoodie base layer and i can surprisingly surf fish during our 40 degree CA coastal winter climates comfortably. it dries quick and easy to pack; just dont leave it in anhot car cuz i feel that is how my pfg sprang leaks (along w it being old). anyways, this jacket is holding up great and will definitely see lotta hard use in the surf for the seasons to comehighly recommend for anyone wanting a simple rain jacket or wader jacket."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,A good rain jacket for the price.,4,"This rain jacket fits really well and kerps you dry when it is pouring. I also like that the hood covers a hat comfortably without pulling down on the hat. Here are a few onservations:What I like:-The sleeves, waist and hood are all adjustable to give you the fit you want depending on your body.-The material is light amd fully waterproof.-It looks well made, not cheap.What I dont like:-The hood is not detachable. If wearing it as a wind breaker without the hood you have the hood laying on the back of your neck with no way to remove it.-The armpits do not have zipper openings so if it is hot you can get a little streamy in it although it is somewhat breathable.Overall it is a good compromise between function and price but is missing a few features that are common on higher end rain jackets."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Great Product, DEFINITELY NOT FAKE!",5,"I needed a new rain jacket, bc my previous Columbia jacket was more of a rain resistant wind breaker. This new jacket with Omni-Tech is pretty cool and comfortable. Splashed some water on it and it definitely repelled water. It is cool and comfortable, and fits right. Big guy friendly for sure. This is the real deal Columbia brand. This is NOT a counterfeit version like some comments suggest (2020 is contagious 🤦🏾‍♂️). If it is, then they deserve an award lol. The packable feature is in the left side pocket, unlike my wind breaker that was on the chest pocket. A small zipper will be exposed once packed.Con - hood always seemed a bit too big and clumsy  in my opinion.Will update once it rains again."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,The 2015 version of this Jacket is not a true TALL size (Short in the sleeves),1,"June 2015 Review:Do not buy. They changed the cut of the jacket. The large tall leaves my wrist and forearms exposed. (I lost the jacket this June and ordered another one since I loved it so much) Originally when I purchased the jacket in 2014 it fit really well. The sleeve length was perfect. In 2015 they changed something and it should no longer be called a ""tall"" size as the sleeves are shorter by more than 2 inches.My fellow lanky brethren you know the struggle of finding clothes that fit you right. Unfortunately Columbia changed their fitting/sizing for this jacket and it's no longer suitable for those with long sleeve lengths.April 2014 review:This jacket fit well on a 6'4"" 215 lb person with 38"" sleeve length.It's very light and I would only use this during spring and early fall. I walked 8 NYC blocks in a down pour and the shirt I was wearing underneath the jacket was completely dry.Very happy with this purchase."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Not waterproof for long durations,3,"Not exactly waterproof. It is for short durations, say walking from your car to the store, or taking your dog on a walk. But for long durations, it is absolutely without question not waterproof. I used it during a 15 hike in the Smokies. It rained a steady light, sometimes moderate, rain for about the last 8 miles, and while it did keep me dry at first, by the end, the shirts I had on underneath with entirely damp. Mind you, not soaked, so I was still relatively comfortable, but I was not dry. So, a decent product for the price, but if you plan on using this for long durations of several hours, I'd be very cautious on expectations. I had high hopes from the reviews I read, but was slightly disappointed."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Rain rolls of your back, and everyother part of the jacket",5,"This jacket is top tier. I can't say enough good things about. It is comfortable, fits nicely and even though it seems thin it's warm. I live in Portland Oregon a city known for rain and after using this jacket I can't go back to my old rain gear. It really is water proof and it looks awsome when the rain hits the jacket it beads and rolls of all the time keeping me dry and warm. It looks stylish and for the price I'm happy. A must own in a rainy city."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,It’s worth a few extra bucks,5,"Best rain jacket I’ve ever owned. I went to a drive-in concert and wore this jacket in pouring rain for about an hour and didn’t get wet at all.The hood is really well designed and has a little brim that keeps the water from running into your face. The draw strings have a little rubber nubs that hold things tight.Also it looks cool and fits as expected. It can fold up into one of the pockets for storage if you need to.A lot of people are saying these are fake and giving one star reviews. I honestly couldn’t tell you if it was real or fake, but honestly if it was a fake, I wouldn’t care. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and is worth more than the price paid when I’m perfectly dry time and time again."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Very nice jacket. Definitely not counterfeit either.,5,"Very nice, high quality jacket. I was worried about it being fake due to a number of reviews but I happened to stop by an academy sports today and the same jacket there was identical (but more expensive). A lot of reviews claimed it was fake because the Logos are printed vs stitched but you can even go on the Columbia website and see that their not supposed to be stitched. Call me crazy but it wouldn’t make sense to puncture a bunch of wholes to thread stitching on a jacket that’s supposed to be waterproof... great jacket. Buy it. It’s Amazon so you can return it if you don’t like it."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Shake the drizzle off,4,"I like the fit. I'm pretty slim/athletic build. Columbia brand tends to fit me very baggy. It was a nice surprise that the medium fit pretty well especially around the waist.I love the Amber color.Although, I can't confirm/deny the claims that there are fakes out there, I feel confident that my jacket is authentic. Let me explain.The ""missing"" embroidered logo... It does not make sense to embroider a logo on waterproof material. You'd have thousands of holes to let water in.The omni-tech logo on the sleve/wrist... It matches the same logo on the  official Columbia website.My guess is that Columbia made these changes as improvements to the waterproof claims of the garment. So, If you get a jacket with an embroidered logo, I'd send that back as the NON-EMBROIDERED is the newer version... version 2.0 if you will.The bad:I dislike the velcro patches to cover the zipper. Pretty annoying when throwing it on/ taking off. COLUMBIA, just give us version 3.0 with a waterproof zipper and get rid of the velcro!I don't know how long this will remain waterproof on a hike in the rain.The good: the color, packable, semi lightweight (Medium size 377.5 grams), kinda stylish. A good budget backpackers rain shell."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Great Customer Service; Ordered the 3X, turned out too big ...",5,"Ordered the 3X, but it turned out too big for me; returned it and waiting on 2X.However, I called Columbia Customer Service (great service btw), and they gave me the exact measures for the jacket, as the size charts on Amazon and on the Columbia website itself are generic.  Here's the info they gave me, hopefully it'll help others (see picture).Size - Chest - Waist - Sleeve Length - Center Back LengthXXL  - 60.0"" - 57.0"" - 39.5"" - 31.0""1X Big - 57.0"" - 55.0"" - 37.0""  - 30.0""2X Big - 61.0"" - 59.0"" - 38.0"" - 31.0""3X Big - 65.0"" - 63.0"" - 38.75"" - 31.0""Cheers!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"5'9 175 lb fits about right, waterproof",5,"Works great for a rain jacket, ran some tap water over the sleeve when I first got it and the water beaded perfectly off, the jacket was totally dry and was able to pack it right away.Fits well.  Length wise a bit longer than most jackets but that's to be expected as it's designed to keep the torso dry.Has the ability to pack into a pouch by inverting the jacket pocket so you can carry it around easily as a pouch- the problem here is that it still takes up a decent size (imagine like two box of pop-tarts stacked)  and the jacket will be very wrinkly when you pull it out if you choose to store it in this way.As far as breathable - Columbia sells a higher end model rain jacket (evapouration) that is known for breathability - this model is like the cheaper one and despite lots of vents on the barrier inside there still is a lot of heat trapping - this is just a natural inevitability of ""real"" rainproof gear.  To be honest, would probably feel like running with a hot trash bag if you wanted to run or do strenuous activity.  With actual rain and casual walking though, this isn't a problem because the rain kind of carries the heat off while still keeping you dry.  Not something you'd want to wear if it isn't raining though in my opinion.Otherwise checks off all the boxes- it's stylish, relatively well-priced, and provides good waterproofing for those doing a casual trails or traveling to a new city and want some water protection without needing an umbrella.  Would recommend."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"NOT Fake, Check Columbia's Website for Variances",5,"I received a jacket that did not have the Omnitech logo, rather just the letters. My 'Columbia' was an applique rather than embroidered. After reading the review about the fake one, I was affraid I fell victim too. However, I went to the Columbia website and zoomed in on different colors. These are perfectly acceptable jacket variances as showed on the authentic brand website. My fears were negated.So, now that I know I have a real jacket:This jacket is amazing. Super lightweight. Super breathable. Not too noisy. Great water repellency. I am 6 ft 1, approximately 160 lbs. I ordered medium. It fits really well. If the sleeve could be a half inch longer, that might be nice, but they are good where they are now. I like to pull sleeves over my hands, though. The pockets are plenty wide and seal up nicely.Overall, this is a great jacket at a steal of a price compared to buying on the official website. Columbia occasionally runs sales to about $45, but only on limited colors."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great rain jacket,5,"This is a really great rain jacket for the price. It's light, waterproof, packable and breathable.I wore this jacket in 8 hour rains while working on a solar field, it will keep you dry for most of the day. It does finally give in slightly after being out in down pours for a few hours but it dries out quick then it's back in action. It also just like the description says does not get dirty, dirt wipes right off.The xl is big enough to wear a hoodie underneath on days it's a bit cooler.Well worth the money"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Almost perfect.,4,"In all fairness I must say I am between sizes right now. Somethings that I buy in the large size are perfect or even a little loose. Others are just snug and a few are too small. I guess with not getting out as much for the past year I have added a few too many pounds. This one fits me just a little snug. I would’ve preferred just a little loose. But as I said, I don’t blame the coat, the coat is great construction. I did think it was a different color green though. It looks more olive in the photo and here it’s some more murky green. But great quality from Columbia as always. I do miss being able to go in the store and compare sizes directly."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Mtb🚵‍♂️ point of Veiw 6 months review.,4,"Snug fit for me I'm 5 9 180 but that's because I prefer my gear that way... but I didnt want it too long either so I can ride my MTB🚵‍♂️🤞 in the rain if we got caught in a storm for our next Utah ride.Pros:  feels super lite weight, cooler than previous  Colombia jackets owned , good for fishing. Nice Hood fit with draw strings.Cons :  Slim fitting feel, bottom joint of zipper KEEPS separating not sure why,  so Not good for MTB 🚵‍♂️which what I bought it for😥.Anyways I guess I kept a nice comfortable fishing jacket where hopefully I dont have to bend over too much so the zipper wont bust open. Since due to Covid we had our Bike 🚵‍♂️trip cancelled 😥. I hope this was just a cheap zipper design because the jacket has alot of potential if they can fix that one detail.Good luck shopping?"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,This is actually fully waterproof,5,"I was looking for a Goretex-like waterproof rain jacket, not one that is only water resistant.  The day after I received this I wore it on a 0.75 mile walk to my local coffee shop in a hard downpour--so wet the skin on my hands shriveled.  I stayed completely dry underneath.  The hood is something that is necessary in this type of a rain jacket that will be used in a downpour, glad it comes with it. I put my phone in the pocket (zipped it up), and it, too, stayed completely dry.The fit is little oversized, about what you would want for a rain jacket that you may wear over a sweater when it is cold.  The jacket has a mesh liner, which may help keep the inside layer from wearing from abrasion.  I look forward to this jacket providing many years of inclement weather comfort."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Go a size down unless you're big around the middle,4,"I'm 6'3"", 225lbs and I bought the XL Tall.Overall I think it's a good jacket. I paid $35 for it and that was a pretty good price. I don't think I would pay more than $50 for this.Pros: the hood (primary reason I bought this jacket, because the hood appeared to actually fit close to your head rather than be huge like so many other jackets), tall sizes available, price, Columbia has good stuff typically.Cons: runs a bit large (mostly around the mid-section), logo is a sticker rather than stitched like other Columbia products (while this isn’t a big deal in itself, it indicates cost cutting which isn’t an inspiring sign for the brand), I wish the hood was adjustable.Update: I returned the XLT for a LT after wearing the XLT once. I just felt like I was swimming in it. The LT is perfect and there's barely a noticeable difference in length between the 2 sizes. The waterproof is great in moderate rain, haven't tried it in an all-out downpour yet but have no reason to suspect product failure."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Mostly untested for running, but...",5,"UPDATE: I have only run in this jacket once. It worked out pretty well. But this is a great looking jacket and keeps me dry.I got this jacket to run in but I almost like the look of it too much to put it through all the rigorous miles. I wanted something affordable because, while I like running, and I like to be dry, I don’t like spending $250+ on one piece of gear.This runs a bit large for something to run in but is perfect for a rainy day or a night out (I don’t like how the adjustable straps at the bottom make the jacket look bunched up when tightened). I thought the burnt orange color would stand out in a run but it turns out it also turns my bland closet into a colorful one.I might get another one in a small and an even brighter color for running. My concern is the small will only get shorter and not be enough of an intake to make the jacket as near to form-fitting as I would like for running."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Decent beginner rain jacket lacking some hiking features,4,"I want to start by saying this review is focused on hiking and backpacking ONLY, not around town use!I was looking for my first rain jacket to wear while hiking and backpacking and purchased this as it was recommended by a friend. For a beginner rain jacket, this was not a bad choice at all. It has a fully adjustable hood, 2 hand pockets of which it packs down into one of them, and is moderately lightweight at 13.5oz for a men's small. After wearing it a couple times, I was very impressed with both its durability and windproof capabilities. I fell several times into Yucca bushes and this jacket didn't have even a slight tear. It also kept me warm from 35mph winds at one mountain summit. It doesn't have pit zips or any ventilation features so why it will protect you from wind, you will bake in warm temperatures quickly. I didn't experience any rain to speak to its waterproof capabilities.Overall, this is more of an around town jacket then a backpacking jacket. Plus as someone who is 5'6"" and weighs 135 with an athletic build, the small felt a bit bulky on me. I ended up returning it for the marmot precip eco which weighs 10oz for a men's small, has a slimmer cut, pit zips for ventilation, and packs much smaller. Not bad for the price but if more features and a hiking focus is required, you may need to look elsewhere."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Good jacket,5,"Being in good shape, I'm always in between a medium and large. Mediums fit the torso and are short on the sleeves. Larges are big in the torso, but have long enough sleeves.6'1""/200lbs and I got a Large. Fits as expected I guess. Seems to break the wind nicely and made of quality, lasting material.The one thing I don't like about it is the Velcro across the zipper. I understand why it's there (to increase closure on the front), but it's honestly really annoying when unzipping because you have to undo every Velcro instead of just unzipping straight down (e.g. it takes 10 seconds to unzip instead of half a second). Primer example of #firstworldproblems, but I probably wouldn't get the jacket again because of it 😂"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"I Don't Think This is a Fake, it's the Real Deal",5,"Some reviews here are stating these jackets are fake Columbia due to the logo not being embroidered, the omni-tech label on the sleeve being different, not having a tag that says ""packable"" in the pocket, etc.Prior to purchasing, I went to Columbia.com and in the photos of this jacket (across multiple colors) you can see the logo and omni-tech sleeve label are the same as what's being posted as ""fake"" here. So I'm fairly confident this is the real deal Columbia Watertight II jacket. I'm guessing Columbia just decided they could save a few bucks by not embroidering their logo, simplifying the omni-tech label, and not sewing a tag that says ""packable"" inside the pocket. Admittedly the updated logo and omni-tech label don't look as nice, but as long as the jacket performs as intended, these shouldn't be deal breakers (not for me at least).As for the jacket, it looks, feels, and fits pretty much identical to my older Watertight II jacket. I'm 6'2 and weigh 230lbs and the XL fits me fine and had plenty of room to layer a fleece underneath for some extra warmth without restricting movement in the jacket.I haven't tested the water repellency of this particular jacket yet, but anticipate that it will perform the same as my older Watertight II and will block the wind just as well too.I use these jackets for general use on rainy days (commuting, running errands, walking the dog, day hikes, etc) and they perform great for those purposes through spring, summer, fall. I also use them in winter with a fleece, etc underneath, but that's typically if I'm not outside for extended lengths of time or running errands and will be in and out from the car to shops and vice versa. I live in Chicagoland and have an above avg tolerance for cold, just to give a baseline.If you're a hardcore outdoors type, you may want to invest in a different jacket. However, if you're looking for a solid rain jacket for general daily life that will provide years of use and cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 (I got lucky and got mine for $30 after tax) this would be a good choice."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great Rain Shell! Definitely recommended!,5,"I bought this jacket for a hiking trip to Mt Rainier where weather changes happen often. We went in July, and the temperatures were around 65 degrees and I could comfortably wear this jacket in that temperature. I'm 5'9 150 lbs and the Medium size fit me just fine with some space to wear a sweater under if I needed it. We did get some rain and this kept me very dry while hiking for 4 hours in the rain.It now hangs on my coat rack in my entry way and I wear it any time I need to go out and its rainy. I wore it when going outside in a heavy downpour to secure some items in our back yard that were blowing away in the wind. My pants were soaked in seconds, but this jacket kept my upper body completely dry. Definitely recommend this jacket!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Dry as a Bone and Stylin' Like a Mofo,5,"Seriously love this jacket! Needed something that was light, waterproof & not ugly (shallow for my clothes) for a trip to Costa Rica & after a lot of looking around found this one. I'm glad I read the reviews because while I tend to shop ""medium"" I took a chance and went with small and it fit perfectly! (5'9"", 160lb here) The gray/black combo is pretty damn stylish (got compliments on it right away) & thanks to a rain day I got to test it out and so far, so good. The adjustable options and Velcro closures really help keep the rain out. Not a ton of ventilation but super high quality and packable (hint look inside the pockets for a ""packable"" tag. Really excited to wear this out and about!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Still a decent jacket, but I liked the old one better.",3,"I found one of the old Columbia Watertight jackets at a Goodwill a few years ago in great condition, and I absolutely loved that jacket. I washed it in some DRW restorer and it was a fine lightweight rain jacket. I know there are better, more breathable jackets out there, but I loved the light, packable nature of the Watertight. Mine was a Large, and it fit just right - a little loose in the summer for breathability, with enough room to wear over a sweater or fleece in the winter. Sadly, I lost it somewhere, so I decided to buy the new one.I have to say, though, I don't think this one is an improvement. It may be a little more breathable or waterproof, but the fit is tighter (no luck getting it over a fleece now, and I haven't gotten any fatter), the material is heavier, and the ""packable"" pocket is gone. If I shove it down in my bag for later use, it will be a wrinkly mess for days (the old one didn't do this nearly as badly). Honestly, it feels cheaper. If you've never experienced the old Watertight, then you'll probably be pleased, just be aware of the fit and the less-packable nature of the jacket."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,zipper problem,3,"I purchased this jacket on Amazon in the Summer of 2017 and wore it occasionally in the Fall of 2017, Spring of 2018 and the Fall of 2018. In he Spring of 2019, after only three seasons of occasional use, the zipper assembly at the bottom of the jacket came apart and it was no longer possible to zip the jacket closed.  I brought the jacket to a local tailor They wanted $45 to replace the entire zipper.  (The tailor said that the original zipper was of cheap quality.)  I'm disappointed that a Columbia product would use cheap hardware in their jackets.Follow up note: I contacted Columbia through their website.  They replied promptly informing me that their outerwear comes with a lifetime guarantee.  They asked me to mail the jacket back to them so they can either repair it or issue a credit."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,PERFECT!! EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ONE!!,5,"This jacket is absolutely perfect. I've bought three, two for myself and my sister in the female version of the same jacket (""Arcadia II"") and this one for my boyfriend. We've had ours for over two years and they are just as durable and good looking as the day they came in the mail. These jackets are super light-weight, comfortable to wear in spring, and pack up into one of the pockets (about fist sized). My boyfriend is 6', about 165 pounds and the medium fit him great, with plenty of room for extra layers. But here's the real thing, this jacket is legit WATER PROOF. We have been through hard, constant rain and these jackets don't let a single drop seep in. A lot of jackets I've tried eventually start to absorb the water, not this one. Columbia is the only company I know of that does the ""omnitech"" coating and as far as I can tell, that is what makes these jackets truly water repellent, no matter the amount of rain. I cannot recommend this jacket enough!!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great rain coat,5,I purchased one of these for work and I liked it so well that I purchased another one for myself.I mainly use it out on the boat and is about the best rain coat that I've ever owned.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Zipper Is Trash,2,"Everything about this Columbia rain jacket is nice, and although I should’ve purchased a size medium instead of the large, I liked it a lot. It’s great on a Fall day, and in the rain, and will keep you dry in all but the heaviest downpours. However, there is one HUGE issue which prevents me from recommending this jacket: The zipper sucks. I was always conscious of the wonky zipper, and was very mindful of whenever I zipped up the jacket to make sure it didn’t get stuck or snag on the inside fabric, but even with this awareness of the wonky zipper’s tendency to jam on the jacket’s inside fabric, it still got stuck, and I can’t for the life of me get it unstuck. So now it’s an expensive pullover! I don’t recommend this Columbia Watertight jacket."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Works fine,5,"I usually wear a size medium, but the chart provided on the product page had me at a small on this jacket so I went ahead and took a chance. The chart was correct and the small fits just right on me. I wore it for the first time yesterday during a fairly strong thunderstorm and the jacket kept me perfectly dry. It repelled the water and kept my torso and head completely dry. My pants were soaked, but my upper body remained water-free. This was a good purchase."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Disappointed,1,I purchased another one of these a while back and it was just too large on me. I got this one and gave the other to my fiancé. This one I barely got on. It fits but it is no way close to being 1 size down from what I got before. Sizing is for sure not true. In the rain and wind it lacks a lot. Hard downpours left my entire neck and chest drentched. It's thin as expected but it didn't offer any protection from the harsh winds or rain which felt like I was being pelted with hail. Not anything like the first one for sure. Also the hood is just not practical. You'd need a hat under it to avoid your face completely being wet. So overall I can't and wouldn't recommend this jacket. Very upset I didn't get the chance to wear it in the elements before the 30 days was up because I would have sent it back right away. I'll stick to L.L. Bean from now on. They at least allow returns no matter when or why. If you aren't satisfied then return it and get your money back.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"SlimmING fit, Not a slim Cut",5,"I got this for my husband who's Very picky but a major procrastinator too. After listening for the last time about his current all weather coat I grabbed my tablet and ordered this during a commercial on TV, only reading a couple reviews because what do I know in the first place about mens coats? He put this on and voila, it fit far better than I imagined it would. Most jackets like this are boxy and bulky looking making a tubby belly look like a fat gut. Not this jacket...TG. Lightly lined so it's not just a plastic sheet but not too warm to use during the summer. Sleeves good length, his arms are med to longish. He wears anywhere from a 34 to a 36 in Levis and the Large fit beautifully.Hood does not fold away but it does lay properly so no ""hump back"".Finally, I bought a clothing item for my husband He didn't hate and return. Thanks amazon. Excellent price!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Columbia Mens watertight 2 rain jacket,5,"I ordered this rain jacket after I borrowed my son's. I had purchased his at Dicks sporting goods a couple months ago. I grabbed it on my way out to check the mail. It kept me completely dry in a heavy downpour. I checked the size and went online and ordered the exact same size,same jacket just in the light gray color instead of black like my sons. The Jacket came quickly. I have wore It in the rain multiple times an it never fails to keep me dry. And warm. Only issue I have is even though our jackets are identical in every way including the size (i ordered a mens jacket also) The Columbia brand is NOT stitched onto the chest with white thread like my sons. Mine looks like something ironed on. same with the words on the bottom of the sleeves. I can't honestly say this jacket is a fake, but Honestly I feel like for the jackets to be made by the same company (columbia) and they both are the men's watertight 2,I think they should of been identical in every way except the color of course. Overall I would recommend this Jacket to men OR women who want to be dry during a rainstorm and it's lined so it will keep you pretty warm also!!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,DONT BUY THIS,1,"Either Columbia has started producing extremely low quality jackets or this is not the real deal. I have the exact same jacket i purchased from a local store and the one i ordered from Amazon is clearly not the same. I wore my old jacket for years and loved it until it wore out. I wanted the same one, and what i got was something that looks like it is from the dollar store. Do not buy this."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Built Tough and Stylish,5,"Very nice form-fitting, wind-breaking rain jacket that I used for a 2wk trek in Central Asia. It kept me plenty dry and warm on 50deg days. I especially like the inside liner that separates the skin from the shell to provide comfort. And the long length that covers the rear was a thoughtful feature that kept more of the body dry on rainy days.Not much improvement needs to be made with this gear, but if asked, I would redesign the bottom a little wider so that when I sit down with the jacket zipped up (I have a rather lean frame), it won't try to split open. I saw the stress that puts on the zipper so I'm careful to unzip every time I sit down. If a wider bottom allows unwanted air inside, the designer can add an elastic/adjustable liner that traps the air, a feature found on short ski jackets.With some care, I think the jacket will continue to serve as my go-to gear for a walk in the city or a an extended adventure."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Much smaller than old Columbia rain jackets,3,"I can't comment on the performance in the rain because it didn't fit.  This product runs much smaller than my old Columbia rain jacket.  I'm about 210 pounds.  My old Columbia rain jacket was a Large, and was so big that when I went fishing I could put the rain jacket over my life jacket.  A Large in this new product is barely big enough to allow adding a flannel shirt without being uncomfortable.  Actual fabric measurement comparisons of Large: chest: 52"" (old) 50"" (new), hips/butt: 53"" (old) 48"" (new).  This product is also much tighter across the shoulder blades than the old one, making it difficult to move arms freely.  If you had an old Columbia rain jacket, you will definitely need to order a size up if you get this one.This jacket has a full mesh liner inside front and back, but there are no inside pockets, and only a standard zipper (no longer a 2-way zipper).  I couldn't find these details anywhere, and had to order to find out.  I guess new does not mean improved."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,NOT FAKE,5,I also thought I was getting a fake jacket.  I spoke with a rep from Columbia who said that the jackets are authentic despite the design change.  Both designs also appear on the Columbia website.  That explains why my local sporting goods store had both designs on the rack.  Contact Columbia if your not convinced as this is a very good rain jacket.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Proven waterproofing.,5,This is my second waterproof jacket from Columbia. The first one is serving someone else now as I lost weight and it no longer fit me well. This one is not the same material or style but it works very well and is just as fashionable (if that matters). I wore this jacket during the NYC 5 Boro Bike tour and managed to keep my upper body perfectly dry. Almost 5hrs on a bike in pouring rain and no water got in. I put the hood on my head under the helmet and kept my head dry too. I highly recommend this jacket. Only gripe is I feel it could use another pocket. Maybe on the chest.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Good for th price I paid,4,"I got this jacket for $40 instead of the sticker price of $90 that it came with. Even though the jacket may appear as a counterfeit, I believe it's a legitimate product both due to the price tag that it arrived with and the fact that it uses name brand zippers. After doing some research, I found that a lot of knockoffs do not use YKK zippers. I believe this is a situation of Colombia cutting corners to save a few dollars on production. For $40 for a waterproof jacket I would say that the quality is acceptable, but I would not have paid the $90 sticker price."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Not waterproof,1,Not waterproof as listed. Okay for mist or very light rain. Was out fishing and it started to rain. Put on the jacket and after a few minutes I was soaked. Everything in my pockets were soaked as well.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Good, But Could Be Better.",4,"Fits as expected. Very versatile and packable. Would recommend two improvements, a two-way front zipper and velcro tabs so that the hood can be rolled up into a collar. I find a rain jacket that reaches below the hips to be ideal until I have to sit down. Columbia parkas that I bought ten and fifteen years ago two way zippers to facilitate bending at the waist. This jacket and the Bugaboo Interchange jacket I bought in 2015 do not have two way zippers and that means I have to unzip the jackets and rely on the velcro tabs to keep the coat closed when I am active outside (raking leaves, shoveling snow, etc).  Similarly, a couple-three velcro strips sewn onto the upper back and inside the hood allows the hood to be turned inside out and rolled up into a collar on the Water-Tight II jacket. That assists in handling the jacket and keeping the hood out of the way when driving."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Will shed rain / water and will add warmth,5,"Liked that it has hook and loop closure as well as front zipper. Liked string snugger at waste- holds jacket in place.  This jacket will shed water and never saw it begin to soak up water in prolonged use. Washed as instructions stated once. No damage from wash.Used in interior Alaska during moderately wet season in 55-60 deg weather.  Jacket will perform as two layers (not just one) so, remember when dressing in layers for warmth.Pockets are deep and wide mouthed. Easy to carry a small umbrella in a pocket that also has zippers as closures.Jacket does not have a designed pack and carry method but, easily wadded up and stuck in the hood and resembles the size of a football when done. And, wrinkles dissipate quickly.Note- information you may see that this product is not a Columbia branded offering are FALSE. The jacket has an embossed logo, not embroidered. The company stopped embroidery on this item to reduce likelihood of water infiltration due to needle holes.Super jacket, buy with confidence."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Doesn't breath, but keeps the water out.",4,"It all depends what you want this for. I give it 5 stars for what it's supposed to do - keep out rain. It's also well made and looks good.However, I bought it to keep me dry on hikes and backpacking. The problem is that if you do anything that makes you sweat, it all just stays on the inside of the jacket, making you wet anyway.If you just want this for around town, short walks etc., this will do the job great."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Third Purchase: Waterproof--Perfect,5,"I brought one of these rain jackets with me to visit my kids in Seattle, and they both wanted one for themselves. They kept borrowing mine for the daily rain showers known for the area. I went back home and bought two more: one for each of them for Christmas. We all love that this jacket is WATERPROOF. Not ""water resistant."" You do not get wet when you're wearing this rain jacket, no matter how hard it pours. I live in Florida, and it's my go-to rain jacket for the ""monsoon season"" (read: hurricane season). It's the best raincoat I've ever had. Good purchase."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great raincoat!,4,"The color isn't exactly as shown - it's darker than it looked on all of the three monitors I looked at. It's not that big a deal, though. As for the fit, I normally wear a women's XL (but Columbia women's XL are too small for me). The Columbia size chart indicates I should wear a men's XL, but I swam in it - the men's large fit well in the chest/torso, but was long in the arms (which is expected in men's jackets) for this woman. I even have room for a layer or two underneath.I like the adjustability of the hood, but wish it would tuck away. I love the Velcro at the wrists, but the Velcro along the zipper is a little annoying when trying to zip and unzip the jacket. The fabric is a little crinkly, but hopefully it will be less after being ""broken in"". It was nicely waterproof when I tested it, but I might change my opinion after actually getting rained on.Thanks to another reviewer, I figured out how to pack the jacket into the left pocket. When packed like this, it takes up a little more room in my day pack than I like. It folds and stuffs into the computer pocket of my day pack, which is fine because i don't take my computer with me while hiking."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great company for bigger men's outdoor needs.,4,Great feeling jacket. Lightweight. Continually impressed with Columbia products as an avid hiker/novice backpacker. Can't stress enough how well they do at offering larger men quality gear!Haven't field tested it yet so I can't rate is resistance/proofing ability. Chest is a big larger but the sleeves and stomach areas were spot on. One thing thats slightly aggravating is the velcro cover over the zippered area. I know its supposed to prevent water from entering through the zipper but when zipping up I get snagged if the fabric folds over too quick. Guess I'll have to practice putting it on in a hurry. Would work well as a light bindbreaker too.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great rain Jacket!,5,"I currently wear a size 3xlt, but ordered a 4xlt to insure it would fit over a hoodie. I should have just went with the 3xlt. I could fit 2 or 3 hoodies under this. So just ordered the size you regularly wear! But guess what, the day after I received this, there was a big storm. I walked 50 minutes in moderate rain. Hoodie was completely dry when i got home!! Great wind breaker as well!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Not Husband Approved: It's Just Okay,3,"I bought this to replace my husband's light weight wind breaker he wore at work a lot. This one looks nice and the fit was good, however the material was thicker than expected and wasn't very soft. This caused the jacket to be kind of noisy when you walked and it wasn't something he could where all day like his older one. In the end he just hung this one up and i haven't seen him wear it since. It's not bad, but just not a go to jacket either."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great lightweight packable raincoat.,5,"Very nice lightweight raincoat that is windproof and packable. The shell is made of a lightweight nylon material. The mesh inner lining is  polyester. The size large weighs 13.75 oz t 390 grams.The coat run true to size. I weigh 175lbs, 46 inch chest and 30 inch waist. The coat fits nice without base layers it also works well over my down jacket and vest for cold weather use.This is perfect for my backpacking needs. I count every gram when it come to backpacking and this coat will help lighten my load while providing the protection I need for 4 season outings.The light grey is a great color to combat black flies in the spring.I am happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this coat."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,I Love This Jacket,5,"It is the perfect rain jacket! My does fits loose up top and tight at the bottom because I am a female and purchase this man's jacket for me, I knew the fit would be that way on me. I love the velcro on the sleeves that tighten the sleeves if I want them tighten. This jacket has keep me warm on windy days and dry on many rainy days since I have purchased it."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great rain jacket,5,"I am 6'*' and have a 38"" sleeve length. This jacket fits very well in the shoulders and the sleeves are plenty long, but the body of the jacket is much longer and a tad baggier in the middle than I anticipated. The zipper has a flap with velcro tabs to keep water out. I've worn this as a lightweight jacket, and during several rainy days. It kept me dry and does breathe very well. Velcro on the sleeves and an adjustable waist string help with fit. Zippered side pockets are big and deep enough to actually put your hands into. One improvement I would like to see is with the hood. It does not have a tension strap to keep the front of the hood from hanging over your eyes. Overall, I like the jacket and would recommend it to others."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Inferior counterfeit,1,"As others have pointed out, this is a cheap counterfeit of the Columbia Watertight II jacket. I am appalled that this is still for sale on Amazon even after multiple complaints from customers. False advertising and trademark violation."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Nice jacket - size ran a bit too large,4,"I ordered this jacket and a North Face Venture at the same time, both in a 3XL.  I ended up returning this Columbia jacket because it was a bit too large and the North Face fit better.  It was a tad more fitted and didn't look as baggy, but still had room for a sweater underneath.  I suspect the Columbia in a 2XL would have been fine but  I didn't have time to order a smaller size to see how it fit.  The lack of pit zips was also a concern as that is a feature I like but not a deal breaker as this is a jacket I plan to wear just around town when it is raining and won't be doing anything strenuous.  I have had a bulkier Columbia Omni Tech combo jacket system for about 18 years and really love it.  That experience and the apparent quality of this rain jacket made it a very close call and I am sure it would have been a favorite if I had kept it.  But the size issue and the timing of a trip for which I needed the jacket tipped the scales in favor of the North Face."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Good jacket for the price. Zipper could be better.,4,"Overall this is a great jacket for wet commute days. No issues with water sealing and it’s nice to get to work dry. My two big issues with this jacket are:1. No Nepoleon/inner chest pocket. I knew this when I bought it and the price reflects it. It’s not worth knocking it to three stars, but be aware of this. I didn’t realize I would miss it so much.2. The zipper is too small. It’s really easy to mis-zip on this zipper and now you’ve got a zipper pull part way up and nothing is zipped. It’s good enough quality of a zipper that there’s not an issue to back it out, but you have to be careful. A beefier zipper would have been nice for an outer shell to provide a more positive experience. I will make sure to look for that on future purchases."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Beware: Received a knockoff,1,"Fake Columbia jacket. Purchased an XL on sale, received a fake with stuck on (not embroidered) Columbia logo, also Omni-tech logo is incorrect. Was wary after another reviewer pointed out the same issue. Returning and paying the extra $12 to pick one up at a local sporting goods store."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great rain jacket!,5,"Nice rain jacket. You have to make sure you follow the Columbia size guide, and you are good to go. They run big. I am 6-2 and 200 lbs, and need size medium. I bought this to replace an older Columbia jacket... that was not as “waterproof” as advertised. This thing is great. Used it at Mont Saint Michel in France on a cool, rainy day. Kept me dry and warm, and was breathable. Nice high quality. Looks good. Delivers at promised. And the hood is a nice design too. Worth every penny of the $60 I paid for it. Will last a long time. Very satisfied."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great value rain jacket/wind breaker,5,"This is my go to jacket for an outer shell...  I've worn it with different degrees of insulative layers beneath it, and it does well to keep the insulation dry, and to keep the airflow to a minimum (adjustable elastic provides constriction around all openings...  cuffs are velcro).  Although there is lighter weight raingear, I use this as my ""insurance"" shell while backpacking in Midwest, and also in the Sierra's (JMT).  My wife and two daughters both have similar (same, shaped for female) Columbia Arcadia II jackets that they've put through test (outdoor sporting events, backpacking).  We've owned them for about a year.  We typically don't look forward to wearing them, but For the price these Columbia rain jackets are an excellent value."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Is it weird to rave about your rain jacket?,5,"I love this rain jacket.I don't know why, but I feel totally cool when I wear it.A huge plus, is that even after feeling cool, I also am kept dry.  The material feels very durable, and it actually keeps me quite warm.There was a long hiking trip where it rained all day, and eventually I started sweating from hiking, and the rain jacket keeps the rain out, but also keeps the sweat in.  Not a complaint really, just a note that this happened to me.The pockets it has have been so convenient--I really appreciate the sealable zipper pockets in the front. I've put my pocket camera in there that I didn't want to get wet, which works really well.Recommended if you want to look good,  feel awesome, and stay dry!  :)"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Stitches came appart after one week!,2,"The inside of the sleeve got unstitched after one day of use (see picture). Is there no pride anymore in doing a lasting quality product? (See picture).  The zippers are poorly designed so they always bite the cloth. I spend half my day getting them unstuck. The cloth itself is very water repellent, what a pitty.  Update: Now both sleeves!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Best Rain Jacket!,5,"After looking all over for the perfect rain jacket, I have found it! I also plan to use it for when it gets a little bit colder (Texas) and I need a thicker layer than my very thin zip up hoodie but don't want something too bulky. Great quality at a great price! Make sure you check the sizing chart and measure to make sure you get the best size for yourself. The sleeves go down too long over the middle of my hands, but there are velcro cuff straps you can use to adjust the tightness so it sits a little higher up. You could also roll up the sleeves. The side pockets and the hood are really nice and it even has the velcro fold over the zipper which is a must have. Everyone should know about this awesome jacket! Spread the word!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"I was rather disappointed in the ""new"" Columbia Watertight 2 jacket",2,"I was rather disappointed in the ""new"" Columbia Watertight 2 jacket.  I have had many of the original Watertight and loved everyone of them.  The new version is oddly shaped.  The sleeves are very narrow and shorter (I think I'll need a Tall version instead).  The body of the jacket is wider than the original but several inches shorter  Columbia has definitely ""cheapened"" the new version.  The liner has been downgraded to a scratchy mesh.  The snaps are gone and replaced with tiny pieces of Velcro.  The chest pocket is also gone and the zipper is cheap as well.  The outer shell does seem to be of the same quality.  I'm wondering if the Evolution jacket is basically the new version or the original Watertight jacket."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,This is a very good rain jacket,4,"This is a very good rain jacket. Sizing is a little bigger but I expected that from other Columbia stuff I own.If you're torn between two sizes try the smaller.Pros:*Lightweight*Packable into left pocket*Waterproof and windproof*Mesh interior acts as separator from the outer part preventing the ""chill effect"" in cold conditions if you only have a short tshirt beneath the jacket.*The hood has a great shape, although it does not pack itself when not needed like other models*Wrist adjustment and with velcro AND elastic is fantastic! best of both worlds!Cons:*Could be a little more breathable*Does not have interior pockets"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,They are REAL and a great buy!,5,"Got this jacket for a Christmas gift, works great! Kept me dry as the outer layer durning the many snow storms we had in NY. Also have the rain pants! All in all it's waterproof. If it kept me dry durning blizzards it should keep me dry in a T-Storm. Both jacket and pants aren't stitched with the logo, it's pressed on. I called Columbia to find out about these so called ""fake"" jackets, they clam they are 110% real it just depends on manufacturing date. The press on is so called eco-friendly and doesn't require Cotton stitching and is the newer process. Took me 15 mins to find this out!! Amazon doesn't want to get sued for selling fake products and advertising them as real."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Good choice for the money.,4,"The performance is what you get in  this price range. It’s fairly waterproof and somewhat breathable but I would say only for a limited time. Great option for once in a while use. Is it the best option for being out all day in a downpour… no. For that type of environment you need to spend the $200 or more to get the next level of materials (Gore-Tex or similar).  You simply aren’t going to get true waterproof and breathable at a roughly $50 price point.As for the reviews on it being a knock off, I don’t think the one I reviewed is, or at least it’s a really good one. The comments on the logo being a decal vs stitching, yes it is but that’s normal for rain gear. Why would you like hundreds of holes in a raincoat with logo stitching?This is working nicely for me as an occasional use rain jacket."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Well made, roomy Jacket",5,"This is my second jacket. I wanted the bright color for visibility. I am surprised that people have complimented  me on the color. The jacket is well made and roomy; no problem with an extra layer underneath. It has two deep zippered pockets that are good. An interior pocket would be nice. It is a rain jacket, but I mostly use it as a wind breaker. It’s very good for cycling."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Waterproof. Breathable. Stylish. He loves it.,5,"My husband had been looking for a nice breathable rain jacket and hoping for Goretex fabric. After reading all the reviews and looking at some of the very high prices for brands with Goretex technology, I discovered Columbia's proprietary waterproof fabric was likely a good bet. At about a third of the cost of some I found the jacket he was looking for. Nice selection of colors. As we joked, ""A grown man's raincoat."" The 'medium' was indeed a medium. Extremely happy with this purchase."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,The Quality Has Declined,2,"I have purchased a few Columbia brand Omnitech style jackets over the years and they have been great jackets.  My last one lasted through hundreds of rainstorms and was intact until the zipper went out at year 5.  The Quality of this most recent jacket is an obvious step down from those great jackets though. The material is more plastic like and is more like wearing a giant trash bag around your body.  Despite some other reviews about the jacket sizes being too large, I find it to be too small.  I've always worn a size medium in these jackets and the medium in this Watertight ii is way too small."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Gump,5,I got rained on this past weekend. I'm talking forest gump rain. I was the only dude who was dry. And so was my cell phone so I could look at the radar and see that the flood Noah talked about was truly here.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Bootleg. Buy at your own risk,2,"Pretty sure this is not authentic Columbia gear. Seems cheaply fabricated. Logos are applied on top of fabric, not sewn into it.Tested with water, but not outside yet. Seems like it will be waterproof though.You can probably get a cheaper rain jacket without the fake logo applied that will perform the same function.It’s very light. I intended to use it as an outside layer on top of a warmer jacket so I got XL. Seems a bit small for XL, but not way too small. Should fit over a hoodie or sweater fine. I only rated it a bit too small for my intended use, if you typically wear XL you should be ok."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Quality has declined,3,"I bought this to replace an older (c.2015) version of the same jacket. It is no longer the excellent product it once was - thinner fabric, cheaper zipper and less pockets. The zipper failed after about six months of occasional use."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Lightweight & Comfortable Rain Jacket,5,"Opened the package this morning and tried it on for size.  I'm 73"" (1.85 Meters) tall, Weight - 200 lbs (90 kg, 14.2 stone).  The large size I purchased is a great fit.  I was a little concerned that the material would be stiff but that is not the case. I adjusted the Velcro wrist straps and started my morning walk.  It was perfect weather to test the jacket.  I walked 1.6 miles (2.6 kilometers) at a pace of 4.0 mph (6.4 kph) in moderate to heavy rain. Temperature was 53 Fahrenheit (about 12 Celsius).  The jacket felt comfortable and kept me dry even in the heavier rain periods.  I was wearing a long sleeve button up shirt and there was still room to add another light layer between the jacket and my shirt.  Regarding the lightweight material, I wouldn't recommend using the jacket below 45 Fahrenheit (7 Celsius) without a heavier under layer.  I should mention that I was using a Gortex ball cap vs. the jacket hood.  No reason, I just prefer ball caps.  Between the walk and a few other outdoor activities, I spent a total of 30 minutes outside.  I came in and took the jacket off.  I was completely dry with the exception of the immediate area around my collar.  This was a direct result of using a ball cap vs. the jacket hood.  I'll try the hood next time.  One point to mention regarding the zipper.  When I went to take the jacket off, the zipper pulled apart from the bottom.  I thought that was odd so I tested the zipper several more times tugging on that area to make sure it wouldn't come apart.  I think it was just one time event but I'll monitor the zipper over the next couple of week to make sure there is no issue.  I would definitely recommend this jacket.  Well worth the investment."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Stick on logo does not mean fake.,4,I will update after use in rain but the med size fits as expected. Zippers look a little weak but do what they need to so far.  I too thought I may have gotten a fake jacket after seeing the reviews here. I went to dicks today and if it is a fake it is the best one I have seen. It is exactly like the ones in the store. They did not have embroidered logo or say packable in the pocket like people on here claim proves authenticity.  I will update after some use.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,I Bought 3!,5,"The Covid-19 epidemic has me returning to the outdoors more and more.  I love this jacket so much I have bought 3.  I wear one of them around town - a light blue version.  I wear one of them biking for exercise around Seattle in a bright green.  This has kept me dry from lots of Seattle's notorious winter wet weather.  I don't choose to ride in the rain, but often the rain chooses for me.  Mostly drizzle, but once a medium heavy rain.It seems to be somewhat breathable.  I come home from rides without rain - damp in the expected places from perspiration, but not soaked like I would be with just a waterproof shell."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great lightweight option for spring/summer,5,"This jacket is very good quality and it is comfortably and breathable. It is much more light weight than my other jacket, so it is perfect for the summer thunderstorms I have been through lately. The sleeves and the torso of the jacket fit a little more casually (meaning it feels a bit large, as opposed to slim), but that hasn't been an issue for me, and it allows you to include more layers if the weather is a little colder. The hood fits well but looks a little weird, but it's not a deal breaker for me. Overall, this is an excellent buy for anyone except the most extreme outdoors people - it will keep you nice and dry unless you are basically sailing on the open  seas or in the rain forest. It's definitely waterPROOF, not water-resistant."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Perfect fit.,5,"This jacket is awesome. There are a lot of reviews out there which claim that these jackets are counterfeit. Those claims are not based on facts. I actually have done the leg work and the jackets being sold on Amazon by Colombia are absolutely real. The jacket is very lightweight and at the same time it seems to hold heat in, so in that respect it's quite warm. I've actually worn this in 45 degree weather and it kept me warm and dry."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Review of size,5,"I just received this raincoat, so I can't comment on durability, but it's Columbia and ought to be OK. However the size is exactly spot on. I wear size 33 inch waist levis, my blazers are 41 inch shoulders, my dress shirts are 16/16.5 inch neck with 33 inch sleeves.  I put on a Hoody with a Tee Shirt underneath. The shoulders on the raincoat dropped exactly where they should have, and the sleeves were perhaps a bit too long, but the sleeves have a cinch and it's probably better being a bit long (as opposed to a bit short) due to the raincoats function in keeping you dry and in case you reach for something. So size large is exactly how it should be."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Works Great for the Price!,5,"I needed a rain jacket that will keep me dry while I put my kids in and out of their car seats and while I wait for them to come out of the car (so, so slow!). It has worked great, keeping me dry and not leaving me too hot on warmer days. During colder days I can fit a heavier sweater or light jacket under it as an extra layer. Great value for the price. I'm glad I didn't pay more  for a heavier duty jacket. I won't be out on a boat fishing in a heavy rain storm, so I think I'm all set with this coat."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Awesome jacket,5,"Bought this for my husband for a trip to Seattle in October. Bought him an XL which is what he usually wears in shirts and it fit him great. He's a big guy, 6'2 and 250lbs, but it worked well as a light rain jacket and he liked it because it didn't make him too hot. He even wears it sometimes in the Florida rainy weather, depending on how hot it is outside it works great as a light top layer, especially if you don't want to carry around an umbrella. It really is a great lightweight jacket, great quality, would buy again."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,WATERPROOF 100% even under the shower,5,"It's a light jacket. It won't protect from cold unless paired with something else. In my job, I have to work sometimes under the rain, and to try and see how well it will protect me, I put it on and went under the shower. I was very pleased and surprised to see I was still completely dry after a couple minutes. If you want something to keep you dry, this is the go to. It does run a bit big. I'm 6'2"" (188cm), slim guy. Bought an XL to have space for getting more clothing underneath, and it came bigger than expected, but I'm still very pleased with it. I recommend it if all you want is to stay completely dry."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Perfect,5,I kept telling myself that I needed to get a rain jacket but that it was still winter so I didn't need one yet.  It then proceeded to rain constantly for I don't even remember how long.  Either way ended up purchasing this after a little bit of research and couldn't be happier.  Other rain coats I've worn were extremely stuffy and hot but this is very light feeling while remaining completely waterproof.  Definitely would recommend.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,not very waterproof,2,"I bought this jacket a couple months ago and got to try it out on a very rainy day last week, the jacket started leaking through in about an hour, I have seen a couple posts that voice concerns about possibly getting a counterfit version of this Columbia jacket,  I have never had a problem with a columbia jacket before so it has me wondering. the columbia logo is not embroidered on and neither is the omni shield logo on the sleeve, i have never seen this on a columbia jacket before.  I am going to be contacting amazon and looking into this further."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great jacket for moderate temperatures,4,"For the price this a great jacket. It keeps my husband dry and as a tall size, the extra length in the waist and arms is great. He likes the hood especially. However, without side vents this jacket heats up quickly. We've had high humidity, monsoon-type weather and during one storm my husband sweat so badly with the jacket on that he took it off and just let the rain pour on him to cool him off. He was wet from sweat anyway so either way he was going to get wet. But I think for fall and especially spring showers, this jacket will serve him tremendously. Very happy."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Amazon supports violent Twitter,1,Supports Twitter by destroying Parler.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Best LIGHTWEIGHT jacket to keep you dry without making you sweat to death,5,"Perfect lightweight jacket.  When you need to stay dry and it’s hot or humid, fleece lined is absolutely NOT the way to go.  This lightweight jacket is the answer.  Keeps me dry, excellent fit, and very nice.  I like how there’s Velcro tabs that secure a flap over the zipper to make sure no rain gets in at all.  Also like how the deep pockets have zippers as well to keep whatever you’re carrying safe.  Finally, Velcro on the cuffs of the sleeve if you need to righted them.  Highly recommend!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Water resistant not proof.,3,"It's not so much waterproof as it says, it's more water resistant.I live in Washington so I put it to the test at work yesterday.Working in the rain for 9 hours my hoodie underneath the jacket was damp at my first half of work, changed out for another hoodie for the secong half of work and that hoodie was damp at the end of my shift.I'd return it due to the advertising as a waterproof jacket but I live in Washington and don't want to go without something for a week."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great for layering,5,"I am a woman. I was having a significant amount of difficulty finding a women’s rain coat that was large enough to wear over my heavier coat when it’s 35 degrees outside and raining. The main issue was the sleeves in women’s coats weren’t long enough or bulky enough to fit over my winter jacket. This coat worked perfectly for the purpose I needed. It’s never leaked. The hood is amazing at keeping the rain out of my face. And it’s thin enough to fold up fairly small to store in my bag or in a suitcase, if needed. I’ve worn it in the summer a few times and it’s a bit big (that was the purpose) but I may purchase a woman’s size since I like the men’s so well. The pockets are also large, but I guess that’s much more common in men’s clothing than women’s in general."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Theses jackets look and feel great!,5,"I was very happy with my order, i got two jackets that look very well made and of good quality for my growing boys in a XL Tall for my 13 year old and 2XL Tall for my 15 year old for those rainy school days in Florida. I was worried it would be too big but they are great, enough room to keep clothes underneath dry and growth! Why Tall you may ask?…well I wanted it to be longer to provide more coverage from the rain."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,I like this jacket.,4,"The Columbia men's watertight II packable rain jacket is a very nice windbreaker/shell to wear during rainy spring/summer days. It's being light weight and breathable helps make it very comfortable to wear even on humid days. It is also very easy to put into a day pack or book bag.What I don't like about this jacket is that it fits somewhat small. I purchased a large and it doesn't give much room for layering. So this isn't the jacket to grab for late fall hiking unless you buy a size larger than you would normally wear. I should have gotten the extra large if I wanted to layer shirts underneath. Finally, the coat isn't as long as I would like. If it were just about two inches longer it would ride further below the waist which would allow water to run off below the pockets. As it is now, rain water runs off right onto the front pockets of my pants. I also wouldn't count on this jacket holding up on rigorous hikes or extended camping trips. The zipper is designed to make this jacket extremely packable and is therefore very light in construction.The jacket is definitely water proof and wind proof. It is a good jacket to wear when walking, shopping, etc. and you expect to get that spring/summer down pour."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Love this jacket!,5,"Saw Columbia and thought ""quality"", and was right! Have worn on many dozens of hikes in PacificNorthwest in sun, wind and rain and this jacket has performed extremely well. Looks as good as the day received after literally hundreds of miles of hiking. Have purchased many hiking jackets and this has been the best at its price. Strongly recommend."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great for Riding Bicycle in the Rain.,5,"I bought this jacket for my husband as a gift. He likes to ride his bicycle, even in the rain. The issue was that the rain jacket he had was uncomfortable because it didn't let moisture wick through from inside. We're both long time Columbia wearers and it's the first brand we check when we're looking for sportswear; their gear lasts for years and is excellent quality. I was thrilled to see that Columbia had exactly what my husband was looking for. My husband loves this jacket! He no longer has moisture build-up inside the jacket and water doesn't penetrate no matter how long he's out in the rain.  It's a nice looking jacket as well and he wears it for casual occasions (errands, around town, etc...) as well as when he's riding his bicycle. It fits him nicely and he reports that it's very comfortable. As far as my husband and I can tell, there is no downside to this jacket."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"NOT counterfeit, but VERY LOUD",3,"Contrary to many claims, this is the same raincoat with appliqued labels that are sold at several sporting goods stores. It is not counterfeit. However, it is the LOUDEST piece of clothing I've ever had my entire life. To the point that it is unwearable."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Hood is a little tall for 5’ 7”,5,"Ok, so it’s a winner. Completely waterproof for hours on end. If you are hiking you will build up a sweat eventually and that will make you wet. But it will take a while, the mesh lining makes a big difference and the jacket will not stick to you. The lining covers the entire body and all but the last 6” of the sleeves.Now my problem, the fit. I wear a large. I suspect it is a perfect fit for someone 6’ or thereabout. I am 5’ 7”. The hood is a bit high when the jacket is on my shoulders so it slumps forward blocking my view. For this I can wear a hat and problem solved.I have not tested it for wind but I suspect it is not windproof. Nothing. About that in the description. That’s fine for my uses."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Zipper,4,"Overall, I liked this jacket. It did what I wanted it to do which was give me a lighter jacket when it wasn't warm enough to be without a jacket but too warm for my coat. The only issue I had was the zipper. It was constantly getting hung up on parts of the jacket. It would get hung up on the inside next to the zipper. It would get hung up on the flap that velcros over the zipper. It got so bad one day, I had to pull the jacket up over my head and  fix the zipper off my body. Good jacket, iffy zipper."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Nice wind/rain jacket,4,"The jacket fits well, and is comfortable to wear. It makes little noise while walking.  The lining helps keep if water resistant. The hood lays flat when not in use.  My only nit is that it has only two pockets.  My last Columbia jacket had 5 pockets,  3 outer, and 2 large inside pockets."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"I am 6' tall, 170lbs, with long arms ...",5,"I am 6' tall, 170lbs, with long arms. I am always stuck deciding between a Large or Medium depending on the fit. I decided to go with the medium after reading some other reviews. I would have gone large, but didn't want it to be too baggy. Its not to small and can be worn over a sweatshirt which does make it more of a snug fit, but still enough room.  The price was right, product is well made and has performed well."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Great product, price",5,"I work outside on air conditioning units all summer. I used to use the heavy, non breathable, movement restricted yellow pvc raincoats. This coat so much better. Keeps you dry, breathes well, and allows full range of movement. Also works as a light windbreaker on cool summer mornings. I was recently working in a steady 60-65 degree drizzle for about 2hrs, and this kept me warm and dry. Not sure how well it would do in heavy downpours, as I don't work on equipment in that scenario, but light rain/ drizzle and even steady ""normal"" rain, works great. Been using all summer and has held up well.  wish I would have bought years ago."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,5 years later - still great!,5,"I bought this rain jacket five years ago, and it's still serving me well! Still looks new, and keeps me dry. Pockets are great, as well - keep cell phone and wallet dry. It's not a warm jacket - but is perfect as an autumn rain jacket that can hold up against light winds. During colder weather, it can easily fit over a few layers if needed. Recommended!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,NOT the same as in the picture,1,"I had the same problem as multiple other customers, this item is either counterfeit or some cheap version that they're selling for a discount. My roommate has the identical model of this jacket and it is completely different.The logo on the chest is printed on instead of embroidered, and looks smudged and cheap. The material is differrent. The sleeves are looser and have a completely different fastening mechanism not to mention the blatantly obvious difference in the logo on the sleeve. The tags inside are different and there's no ""packable"" tag on the pocket when you zip it up to pack it down.I will be requesting a refund and am frankly shocked that Amazon would be selling a potentially counterfeit or cheap version and will certainly think twice before buying any brand name items on this site again."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Good product good price,5,"The quality is good, definitely water resistant. I have seen bad reviews about the brand label being fake so I am waiting to compare it with the ones they have at REI to see if they are embroidered or just stamped. Even if the brand name falls off after time, as long as the jacket stays waterproof, that's all that matters to me. The review with the picture that has an embroidered label actually looks more generic to me but I guess I will see what REI has and then update my review..."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Realign works in a downpour,5,"I bought this to replace my old 12 year old rain coat.  It appears to be well made and definitely works in an all day rain which we had two days after I received this coat.  I am 6 foot 2inches, 220, and I bought this in a 2xl size to accommodate wearing a coat underneath, worked quite well.  It is big with out a coat but it covers everything, zipper works easy  and works well.  The only item that bothered me was the hood was quite large and even with a baseball cap on it tended to hang over in my sight.  I just needed to roll the brim back, easy to do.  Good coat, well made, I would buy again."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,This Columbia jacket is counterfeit!,1,"This Columbia jacket is not a genuine Columbia brand, it is counterfeit! The real Columbia has their logo embodied on, this one was screened on (very cheap looking). And the quality of materials and stitching was lacking."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Finally founf my rain jacket,5,"Wanted to buy the EB brand but couldn't get my account updated. Tired of getting wet from early morning drizzles & passing showers. Researched NF, EB & the other major brands. Price was right, almost 50% off the list retail price. Various colors available. Fits large, sleeves are about 2 inches longer than I like and so is the length. My chest & shoulders fit well which makes it comfortable. It does repel water."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Watertight 2 is not as good as original,4,I got one of these for my dad because I have the original Watertight jacket and I love it. The Watertight 2 has been redesigned to have no breast or inside pocket. The deep large inside pocket was one of my favorite things about the original. You can keep a pair of gloves in there. They also replaced the snaps with cheap velcro. I always find it odd when a company redesigns a winning product to make it inferior. What's the deal with that?
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Great jacket, worth the purchase!",5,"I got this jacket for myself and I absolutely love it! Of course it is a little long as I order a male jacket and I am a female, but it is just as I expected and works perfect to keep my back dry! I am a 5'5"" and 140 pound female, and the small jacket fits perfectly! I got this jacket for my trip to Italy, and it was definitely worth the money! It did rain quite a bit while on the trip, so I am really glad that I brought it. It starting pouring down rain, my jacket was completely soaked and so were my shoes (no way to help that), but everything under the jacket was perfectly dry! The rain just rolls off the material. The jacket even dried very quickly so I was able to pack it up. Like others have said, it can be easily packed into a pouch, which is one of the pockets of the jacket. When packing it up, it comes out wrinkly but they quickly disappear after wearing the jacket for a short while. I really like how the two hand pockets zip close and how there is Velcro that goes over the front zipper to keep you dry. The inside of the jacket is a mesh material, which some many be weary about but I did not find myself uncomfortable at all. Another reason I went with this jacket is that there is the ability to tighten the bottom of the jacket to fit tighter. The jacket also kept me slightly warm, and I was even able to wear a sweatshirt underneath with plenty of room. It is the perfect rain/cool weather jacket. Obviously it is not meant to keep you warm in very cold weather, but on a cool summer night, this jacket would work great. I have never really had a good rain jacket before so it is difficult to compare it to much. However, I would definitely purchase this again and I would highly recommend this jacket to anyone!!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Good quality,4,"The name says it all. I’ve always been satisfied with Columbia merchandise. The fabric is exactly as  I expected. The fit is just right and I know it will wear well. I highly recommend this jacket for warm rainy nights or windy spring days. Of course come winter, I’ll retrieve my Columbia ski jacket out of the closet and be confident it’ll wear just like new. I only hope I didn’t gain too much weight during Covid Lockdown (yikes!) This Fall I just may have to purchase a nice rain jacket from them as this one is strictly meant for milder temperatures."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Love Columbia . . . but . . .,4,"Okay so you look at the bright orange and think you are getting . . bright orange . . . well, it's orange but dull, and not ""safety"" orange which I want for the field. That said, it is close enough and I will keep it. Sizing, is pretty close, maybe a tad small. I got a XL, but am going to try XXL before I decide. The XL fits but is a bit constrictive in the armpits. All in all, it is nice, but I would say it is pricey."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Quick Delivery, Great Jacket",5,"I got this raincoat for myself.  When I got it and my wife saw how good it was, she wanted and now has one as well.  We are very pleased with this purchase.  I used it quite a bit over the past couple of months as we have had a fair amount of rain during this time.  It has worked well and has proven to be very waterproof thus far.  I particularly like the hood as I have always hated rain going down my neck and back with other non-hooded coats.  There is plenty of hood to keep your head and neck dry and still cover my baseball hat, which helps keep the hood from covering my eyes.  While not heavy, it does provide a nice level of warmth as well."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Mediocre,3,"If you’re in between sizes you may wanna get the smaller of the two you are between, as the jacket is a little baggy. That may be as expected for a rain jacket but just be warned.I wasn’t too impressed for the price I expected better quality. It does the job but the velcro feels like it will wear out very quick and the material albeit lightweight feels very weak. It appears to be a genuine Columbia after checking the branding and all. Does it’s job of keeping the wind off quite well.I will update this review as I continue to use the jacket"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,The jacket actually repels the water which is nice. I've worn it in about 40 mins of ...,5,"I ordered this jacket to keep me dry during my 30 min walk to work on rainy days, and so far it's done the trick! The jacket actually repels the water which is nice. I've worn it in about 40 mins of light but consistent rain and my clothes underneath were completely dry.The jacket is light, so I just layered with a sweatshirt on a colder day and it was warm enough. I can see this being a good transitional jacket for all seasons - warm or coldFit: I'm a 6 feet tall, 180lb woman and ordered the Large Tall size. This jacket fit great in the shoulders, and pretty well otherwise - it is a little loose, particularly in the chest and stomach, but I like my outerwear looser so I can layer underneath and also move around easily. I have very long arms (about a 6'4"" wingspan) and the sleeves are a great length and cover my wrists.The only issue so far is that the black looks more like a very dark blue when its worn with other black clothes."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Super comfy and great weight,5,"My husband loves his new red jacket. He's 5'11"" and everything fit great. The length in the body and sleeves hit him just right. It was roomy enough to wear layers but not too big or body. He thinks it's really comfortable as well. We haven't had a chance to test it's performance in weather conditions because we're trying our best to follow pandemic guidelines. It arrived very quickly.  It zipped easily and the adjustable velcro at the wrist is always great. I think you'll be very happy with this jacket."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,The best rain jacket period!,5,"This is the rain jacket that really does keep you dry, no matter how hard it is raining. When I am going building to building for my business meetings and need to keep by dress shirt dry and looking good, I can depend on this jacket. Not only that, it breaths so I am not pitting out my shirt from the inside on those hot sticky summer day rains. You can stop researching, I already did that for you. This is the one to buy."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Function and price,5,"The function and price are as expected.  I had read a review that indicated that the jackets with only the printed labeling on the sleeve were knock offs.  When it arrived with just the printing, I decided to return it.  Fortunately, before I returned it I priced one at a local retailer.  The ones in the outdoor gear store were exactly like the one I received from Amazon.  It, too, was manufactured in Vietnam where the other jacket I purchased about 4 years ago was made.  Although the sleeve label has changed, the place of manufacture and the quality have not.  I am pleased with the purchase and feel confident that it is not a Chinese knock off.  This one was $20-$25 less than the one in the store.  Thanks for the good quality and good price, despite the different label."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great Color,5,"First, this is a sharp color. It's sort of a camo green with a hint of gray. Exactly the color I wanted. Also the inside color is kind of subdued. Not obnoxious at all. I got a chance to test this jacket in a light rain. The water beaded off like it was glass. After 10 minutes I went inside to look for moisture on the inside of the jacket. None. If you have a wet sensation while wearing it, it is only the cold water next to your skin. It has a layer of mesh lining the inside. I would imagine they put it there so the waterproof part doesn't stick to your skin if you sweat at all. It has a waterproof guarantee too."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Item not what is descriped.,1,"It appears there are different versions of this jacket, one that can pack into hand pocket and one that does not.  The bullets state ""COMFORT & WARMTH: Crafted of a waterproof 100% nylon shell, this rain jacket is lightweight while remaining protective. It also packs into your hand pocket.""  I seen reviews with it, and some without.  This was one feature I wanted to keep in my car under the seat.  I got without.  So returned.  Also note the image shows embroidered Columbia on jacket.  Mine was not.  Not that it matters, but it makes me wonder if truly a Columbia product."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Did it’s job!,5,"My husband wore his new rain jacket at a cattle dog trial today, May 20, 2021, in Iowa. The temperatures hovered in the low to mid seventies, and it rained most of the day. He stayed dry. It did its job!  The fit is good. Light weight—suited well for warm spring and summer rains. If you’re needing a jacket for cold rain, plan to size accordingly to wear warm clothes underneath.  Not a Gortex, of course, but all in all, a nice jacket."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Sizing is a bit different than other Columbia gear,4,"I've already worn this jacket in the rain several times and I'm happy with the quality.  Like others have said, it's breathable, so don't expect it to warm you up, but it does keep the wind off of you.  I would give this 5 stars, but the sizing is different than all my other Columbia gear.  I wear a large in all my other gear, but the large on this jacket was huge.  I went to the medium and it's a fairly tight fit.  I won't be able to wear any thicker sweaters under this jacket.  I'm 5'8"" with a 44"" chest"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Good all round light rain coat,4,"This jacket has been a very good buy for me. I originally purchased for use in a project during stormy weather, but have continued to use it since. The construction has held up well and the material is easily cleaned. My only real complaint is the zipper can sometimes come lose at the bottom, to fix this issue I just zip it back down and rezip it back up."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,This is a good jacket. It does what a good rain jacket ...,4,"This is a good jacket. It does what a good rain jacket is supposed to do... it keeps you dry. This is a lightweight jacket. You can pack the entire jacket into it's own pocket.  The reason why I didn't give it four stars is because it's hood is little clumsy it covers your eyes and it doesn't pack as small as other jackets. When you compare this jacket to the top rated Marmot Men's Precip Jacket it is not as good. The Marmot packs smaller into it's own left pocket and you can zip the pocket up because the zipper is operable on both sides. This is not the case for this Columbia jacket. The Marmot is lighter, feels better, has a better hood and is an overall better jacket.I suppose if I hadn't tried the Marmot I would have given this 5 stars. I probably would have also given it 5 stars if the far better Marmot wasn't only $10 more."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great Jacket and not a fake as per Manufacturer (Azure Blue),5,"I bought this Jacket and it is a high quality product, color and fit are as expected. I have not tried yet in the elements.NOT FAKE: I read the reviews prior to buying it and a couple of ones got my attention.  They stated it is a fake as it does not have an embroiled logo on the chest and the ""packable"" tag in the left pocket.  After I received mine, I checked it and and it looks like the one in the picture from  manufacturers web page. The logo is not embroiled and did not have the tag in the pocket. I contacted the manufacturer and spoke to a representative about the authenticity of the jacket. We went through the jacket, labels and manufacturer number (pictures attached). They did verified it is a legitimate jacket. Here is the deal: the original pieces come with a manufacturer code of two (2) letters and four (4) numbers, like AL4355, in the tag where the care instructions are. Some in the tag at the neck. They verified mine is an older model, but a legitimate one. The newer model changed the logo either on the chest or sleeve and added the ""packable tag"". So, if you purchased one like the one I did and/or another old  color/model  with the same characteristics, look for the code in the tag (i.e. AL4355) and do not worry, they are legit, just and older model."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Not Bad, Opted for Another Brand",3,"I really like Columbia products. I haven't had much issue with anything I've got from there, which has been quite a bit. However, this rain jacket didn't quite hit the mark. I ended up going with an Outdoor Research Helium II (mainly cause I got a great deal on it). Overall, this just felt rather uncomfortable to wear. It just seemed stiff and the cuffs around the hands were really uncomfortable. It kind of irritated my hand after rubbing around my wrist for a while during a test run. Depending on what you are expecting, I would say the price matches the quality. However, I needed something a bit more comfortable and lighter weight."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Just what the doctor ordered.,5,"It is exactly what I was looking for.  Lightweight, inexpensive, waterproof, comfortable.It does run one size too small.  I would normally wear a medium in the other manufacturers.  I had to go with a Large from Columbia.  I went to a sporting goods store to try it out first.  This is the same with ALL Columbia gear.Not as ""Breathable"" as I had hoped, but neither are any of the other brand names.  Just the nature of the beast.  The mesh lining is supposed to indicate that it is a 2-layer system as opposed to a more expensive 2.5 or 3 layer system, but I prefer this type of liner so if I have only a T-Shirt on, my skin does not touch the rubbery waterproof material.I have another waterproof coat from they folks up North.  It is Gor-Tex, which is the standard in waterproof.  Much more expensive but much heavier as well.  I was looking for something for warm, rainy days.  This is MUCH better.  If I were to request one improvement it would be pit-zips.  But you won't find those in this price class anywhere so not a negative.  Mostly a wish."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,**IRON ON LOGOS ARE NOT FAKES**,5,"I see some reviews stating that if the logo is iron on and not embroidered on then it's a fake, which is NOT TRUE. I checked the Columbia website and their photos show some are embroidered and some are iron on, some have the diamond logo on the sleeve and some just have the lettering. It's seems to just be a design change that Columbia made at some point. Overall it's an excellent jacket."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Keeps you dry,5,"These rain jackets are perfect for outdoor work. They are definitely light weight, so don’t expect them to keep you warm, however they are great for our super hot and humid southeast climate! They stand up to the afternoon downpours and none of us have to worry about being soaked each day anymore! I bought them for my whole team and everyone is satisfied!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,the velcro would have filled in nicely. The pockets are comfortably large and have zippered ...,5,"Bought this jacket for a trip to Switzerland. Because I was packing for 2 weeks in a single carry-on suitcase, I needed a light rain jacket that would fit in an extremely small space. This jacket fit the bill and with one day of rain during the trip it came in very handy! When not wearing the jacket, it folded into its own pocket and formed a small bundle.The plastic zipper feels somewhat cheaply made, but it is perfectly functional and there are velcro closures that hold the front flaps closed. So even if the zipper had failed, the velcro would have filled in nicely. The pockets are comfortably large and have zippered closures to keep your pocket contents securely in place."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Correct fit/No vents/No hood storage,4,The jacket is correct sizing and great color. I ordered large and it fits like a large should fit. My husband likes it but has 3 suggestions. There are NO VENTS. So he gets sweaty when out walking/hiking. There is NO HOOD STORAGE in the collar so the hood is always flapping around. There is only a MESH POCKET LINING so that is exposed when the coat is folded into its pocket for storage. And little tiny bits fall out of the pocket. So we WON'T PURCHASE again.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Not fake and packable,4,"I have not worn this yet but for those saying this is fake, I bought the exact same jacket at Khols...same product number and barcoade. It also has the ironed on Columbia logo.As for packable, look at the zipper on the left hand pocket. It has a pull tab on the inside enabling you yo close the pocket once the jacket is stuffed inside out."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,So Far So Good.,5,"I probably shouldn't give it 5 stars since I just got it and haven't worn it in the rain, but the 5 stars are for the coat being exactly what I wanted in every other category. You can tell right off it is made well with quality material. The fit was perfect. I'm a pretty big guy , 6ft 235#. XL was perfect for me with some room for light winter wear underneath.  In fact, the main thing I like about is that it's not a big insulated, heavy garment.  I live in N.C. and we've had a fairly mild but very wet winter. This coat is perfect for that.  It has a nice mesh liner for airflow so you won't feel like you're  in a sauna on a mild day."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great protection at an affordable price!,5,"I ordered this jacket along with a few other friends. It’s still the only raincoat we recommend to others! The pockets are spacious enough to store all my essentials, and the jacket keeps me surprisingly warm despite how thin it is. I appreciate the ability to either zip it up completely, or simply velcro it together if I’m in a rush. And of course, great at keeping water out. As an added bonus, the jacket can be completely stuffed into one of the pockets to create a small package that’s easy to store in a suitcase or toss in a backpack. One of Columbia’s best!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,ITEM RUNS SMALL,3,"A nice value rain parka for my wife but she only wore it once because some of the sewing on the back of the jacket failed.  I believe she referred this failure to the ""sewing of the dart's"" failed.  The jacket was ordered according to size charts that are furnished by Amazon, and which agreed with her jacket size's of other owned jackets she wears.  So, this was not the case as the jacket was wearable but the fit was snug, where it shouldn't have been.  She is looking on Amazon for another rain parka, this time we will try Columbia, of which I have had very good luck with in the past.  The Amazon return process worked very well."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Affordable, lightweight, comfortable. As described, this is not a ""packable"" product.",4,"Affordable, lightweight, comfortable. Fit was good. Keeps the rain off and travels well. There seems to be some confusion for this Amazon listing - the jacket design might have been updated or changed but the old reviews are still here. For the product that I purchased in August 2015, the title and description for this listing did *not* advertise that it was ""packable"" (zips into a pouch). That was not a feature that I needed or expected to receive. Some of the reviews here seem confused about why they can't pack it. The jacket is a lightweight material and does compress easily, so you can roll it up quite easily and fit it into a small amount of space. It just isn't designed with Columbia's ""packable"" feature to zip it up inside of one of its own pockets."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Good except loose and short.,5,The length could have had another 5-6 inches and it fits a little loose.  I ordered one size below my normal.  Maybe I should have done two sizes.  Other than that I'm really like it.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Sizing,3,"Read reviews befiore I purchased, as am very concerned re sizing of clothing purchased through Amazon. Bought a shirt XL but when I received it, it was massively big, that It looked ridiculous and was unable to wear. So after reading reviews I came to the conclusion that the XL jacket would be ok as then I could wear something a little bulky underneath such as a sweatshirt. But on receipt I find it a little tight under the arms so basically all I can wear is a light polo shirt. Not very happy, so don't think I will buy clothing again on line unless I am able to try before I buyLittle disappointed as even with the postage added some of these items are far cheaper than we can buy in New Zealand but not much point when they don't fit"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Very comfortable and great for jogging,5,"The jacket fits very nicely. It is light and easy to pack and transport. I've worn it running on very cold and cool days and coupled with a pair of gloves and hat, the jacket kept me warm. It's also light weight enough for everyday wear. The hood has pull string closures and covers my head nicely - not too bit to block my vision but enough to keep from getting wet if it was raining. Very happy with the purchase and can see why there are so many positive reviews of the jacket."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Perfect.,5,"Its been pouring everyday where I am. And for some terrible reason, the only weather-proof jacket I had, did NOT have a hood. So I bought this in ""Graphite"" color so I can't comment on any other color and how accurate they are. I love the color on this. Fits great. Didn't even know it was packable, but it is a nice touch and easier to carry around now. Love the velcro on the chin of the hood to keep it from blowing off too easily. I dont get too hot and sweaty in this like the other ones either! Highly recommend."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great cool weather and rainy day jacket.,5,I just replace the one I wore several years ago.  I wore the old one hundreds of times.  It's light and packable.  A basic two hand pockets jacket but does have a Velcro wind flap over the zipper and zipper pocket so it doesn't hit your chin.  Quite good for the price that's why I replaced my lost one with the same jacket.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great product,5,"It's hard to find the right length for a coat when your tall and don't fit into the ""big"" catagory. Great length and the arms don't ride up to your elbows while you are reaching for something."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,It’s just a windbreaker,4,"Jacket is basically a windbreaker. Decent jacket, but zero lining aside of the mesh inside so do NOT use it in really cold weather. Also, material that covers the zipper is secured by velcro. Don’t remember reading that in the description, but definitely something to know!!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,FAKE!!!!,1,"I first placed an order for a size Small in black after hearing great things about this jacket from a friend. After receiving the jacket first thing I noticed is that it is not packable. My friend insisted that his was in fact packable and after comparing the two we noticed multiple differences in logos, stitching and quality. I also found reviews of fake jackets out there. So I returned it and ordered another hoping that maybe I was just unlucky. Well I just received another one and it's another fake. Amazon what the heck is going on with your quality control!? I'm really disappointed and will be returning the second jacket as well."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Fashionable and effective as advertised,4,"I like the jacket. I was looking for an over-garment that would keep me dry in any storm. This good looking and truly watertight garment does that.It is sized larger than I expected. I originally ordered XL, and I felt like a tent pole. Even with the large size, the sleeves are a little too long, but the sleeve ties compensate. The rain jacket fits comfortably over a full suit.The jacket is comfortable to wear. Attention to detail is excellent, and the hood is adjustable with a soft ""brim"" over my eyes."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Excellent Jacket for Wind and Rain,5,"This is the second one that was purchased.  Works great even in hard rain. Repels the rain and breathes well, but sometimes the rain will eventually penetrate and shirt will be slightly, very slightly damp. But excellent jacket for the wind and rain. Washed it about 12 times and the repellency finally said bye.  So need to order another.  It’s a decent jacket and if you purchase the matching pants, it looks like it belongs on a golf course or on a motorcycle.  A+"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Great jacket, Sizing is Off",5,"The jacket is great, their sizing recommendation not so much. I literally took my measurements and ordered an XLT based on that.  I received the XLT and it was way too large.  So returned it and re-ordered the jacket in Large Tall. Not it fits.  Moral of the story is they fit big, I would go a sized down."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Excellent Columbia Jacket!,5,"This is yet another fantastic jacket from Columbia. I liked this model so much, I bought a second one. The material is waterproof in light to moderate rain and vents well to help minimize sweat retention in mild temperatures. The mesh liner inside the jacket is one of my favorite features as it keeps the material from sticking to your skin. These jackets are well-made and the material seems to get softer and softer the more you wear it. You can’t go wrong for the price if you are looking for a good rain jacket."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great rain coat.,5,Great jacket. Keeps the rain out very well. Doors what is supposed to do.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Zero wind protection, poorly designed",2,"This is very thin, and offers zero wind protection. It also makes a TON of noise, more than any jacket I've owned.It IS waterproof, but only practical in a summer rain."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,I was disappointed when the watertight I jacket was discontinued as it ...,4,"I was disappointed when the watertight I jacket was discontinued as it fit me very well (I'm 6'6"" 200lbs and wear the XL which has room for a sweater underneath if I need) .  In particular, I commute by bicycle in the rain and it covers my rear even when bent over the bars.  Unfortunately the zipper on my jacket broke and a tailor said it would be cheaper to by a new jacket than replace the zipper. Reviews from this new model seemed to suggest it was shorter (I believe it is by 1 inch but that isn't noticeable to me).This jacket does it's job well and is similar to the previous watertight in most respects except for the lack of chest pocket.  The chest pocket on the previous model was deep and I could store a ton of stuff in a pinch, often relieving the need for a separate bag or helping out when my pockets were full.  I'm now happily biking in this jacket."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Fake product,1,"I too received a fake jacket. Notice the logos are stamped, not embroidered like the product image on the description. Velcro is black and not the color of the outer shell. Not packable as the product description states.Unacceptable."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Sleeves are long but fit it tight through the chest and armpits,4,"If I'd have gone up a size the sleeves would have been way too long and so would the waist.  The chest is a little snug and you are aware of a tug in the armpit.  Won't be able to wear anything significant underneath.Other than that, nice construction and I like the netted lining to try and keep you from sticking to the jacket.Update: I had to go with a large size in the end as the original medium size would not fit over anything but a light shirt."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Sleeves too tight,1,"Horrible fit. I ordered an XL, Tall. I got a jacket with a label with ""XLT"" written on it.  I think they use 12 year old girls to measure for sleeve girth. I could slip this on over a t-shirt, but you could see the veins in my forearms through the sleeve, that's how tight it was. No, I'm not Popeye. :)  I cannot imagine trying to put this on over a long sleeve shirt, let alone a polartec layer. The shoulders and chest seemed okay; the sleeves were meant for some sort of skeleton person. If you have any meat on your arms at all this won't fit. On the other hand, if the thought of lifting a 5 pound bag of flour sends you looking for someone to help, this may be the jacket for you. ;)I had high hopes. They were dashed."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Good jacket; Needs a chest pocket,4,"This jacket works and the price was right but it would have fit the bill perfectly with 5 stars if it had a zippered outer chest pocket or even a simple inside chest pocket.  In my old (15 years+) version, that is where I carried my phone.  I use this as a windbreaker for outdoor workout and warmup."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Great jacket, comfortable, and good fit",5,"I bought this jacket to wear when I'm hiking.  In the winter I use it as an outer layer for warmth.  I keep it stuffed in small hiking backpack, so it's available if I need it on a cool windy day and/or if it starts raining.  There are two changes I would like for this jacket - a dual zipper that would allow me to zip it up from the bottom.  This is nice when I'm wearing it in the car.  Secondly, I would like to be able to roll up the hood when I don't need it.  I will add Velcro strips stitched onto the hood and jacket to accomplish this."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Score!!,5,"After reading a few reviews re: sizing, I was a bit hesitant about making the usual selection (large) but looking at the size guide, ""free return"", and the go-with-everything grey, I trusted choosing the usual large. It arrived well before the husband's birthday and fit perfectly, with room for a light sweater and a few-too-many fries underneath. My guy is about 185-190 lbs., 5'9"", size 36 waist. He really liked it and didn't care (as I did) that it didn't have an interior pocket or two."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great rain jacket,5,"I bought this as a light day to day jacket for a trip to Europe. It was perfect for that function, especially given that the majority of my trip was overcast or drizzly. This kept me adequately dry all the way, save one day in Amsterdam where I really pushed it with a walking tour and I had some moisture underneath the jacket areas (after several hours, with no umbrella - I put this one on me and not the jacket). It was also warm enough for me (with no layers) in most early autumn situations, but I tend to run hot so your mileage may vary.Overall very happy with this product."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Fantastic. Been using it all winter/spring and I love it.,5,I am so glad I pulled the trigger on this jacket and purchased it. Just an amazing jacket. I do rowing as a sport and I pretty much wore this same jacket everyday this spring semester. I have done sit ups and other weird exercises in it without any issues or tears.  Super light and folds into a small area. I am impressed
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,A large size that's actually large!,5,"I was surprised that the large size was actually as roomy as advertised. A common complaint about apparel purchased online these days, is that the sizes tend to run small. Not so with this product.  It's an actual large size, like those I remember from years ago. Also, this jacket works perfectly as light weight wind and rain garb. No fancy liners or heavy insulation. I prefer this type of construction because I like to bulk up underneath by wearing a sweater, shirt, and tee-shirt.Decent zippers all around, too. Sadly, no interior pockets. A small quibble, because I like to put my cell phone or wallet inside out of the elements. Still, the side zippered pockets work well for that purpose."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Love it!,4,"Love my new raincoat. A great buy for just the type of rain jacket that I had been looking for. Only reason I did not give it a 5 star was because I had to return the first one ordered as they tend to run a bit on the large side. 9 out of ten times I wear a medium for this type of outerwear, however, the medium size turned out to be a little too big, specially the length of the arms. I went ahead and returned the medium and ordered and ordered a small one which fits perfect! I also got a chance to change the color from the bland ash gray to the navy blue. Received it the next day on which we happened to have two downpours. I purposely got out in the rain to test it and was extremely pleased with how it kept me dry and comfortable. Truly a waterproof rain jacket!!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Size up,5,"I got this for my husband for when he's at work and it rains. He said it keeps him dry and blocks the wind. I will say if you want to be able to sit down with it zipped up, consider sizing up if you have a belly. It's not too tight while standing, a perfect fit, but he has to unzip it to sit down."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great product and keeps me dry in Seattle WA!,5,"I try to walk to work if it isn't pouring down rain and this is the prefect jacket. It does not have any warmth abilities at all, just a nice light shell. I have hoodies or a jacket or both if it gets cold. Oh and the hood fits great and can be adjusted to actually stay in place.Great product, just wish for a shell it was a bit cheaper."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Best rain jacket on the market, period.",5,"Order one size below your normal fit size. I am 150lbs, 6'0"", with a 38-40 chest, so normally a medium would be great - I ordered the small based on all the reviews here and it fits perfectly! I love this jacket because of the neutral gray color, the fact that it does not make you sweat profusely like normal rain jackets do, and literally whatever is covered up by this jacket WILL NOT GET WET. Columbia has nailed it with this rain jacket imho. If you want to stay dry and cool, buy it. If you want to sweat profusely and be rained on with your current jacket, well, that's just not smart."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Knockoff !!,1,"Do not buy !! As others have mentioned, I also received a counterfeit jacket. Iron on labels, missing tags and plain cheap. Columbia products are expensive for a reason and this is certainly not worthy of the name or price."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Nice Jacket, but its not packable",3,"Great jacket. I can't wait to try it out. I love how light it is, the hood is big and the mesh is great. Normally I have no issues, but my complaint though is that it is NOT packable as described. I also thought the hood was stoable, but no big deal there. What sold me was the packable capability, so that's a disappointment. Part of me wants to return it, but I will be needing it this weekend."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,zipper broke early on,2,"I like this jacket, sadly the zipper broke early on (starts opening up at the bottom). You can open it and then reset it again, but it keeps opening again at the bottom the moment there is a little pressure. By little bit of pressure may be a wide stride while walking.  I think a jacket for over $50 should not be doing that."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,I mostly like it but there are pros and cons,4,"First, let me start by recommending that you buy at least a size smaller. These rain jackets are massive. I'm a Medium and even the Small looks somewhat big on me. Then, the quality is really good. It's as waterproof as it gets and lightweight without being super thin - it's not a poncho, nowhere near. Also the color grey looked pretty awesome. I would generally recommend, though there might be better options out there."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,I hate the rain but love this jacket!,5,"I've always disliked rain jackets. All the ones i've owned previously were too hot and got me sweaty, but this one doesn't. It is not sweat inducing, and also incredibly watertight. I've been in some pretty torrential rain in this thing, my jeans got soaked through, but my torso was bone dry.My only design complaint would be that the hood comes down a little far over my face, obstructing my view of much more than people on the sidewalk.I like the packable feature. It makes it easy to toss the jacket in my backpack if rain is expected later in the day. A note on the packing feature. It took me longer than I'd like to admit to figure out how to pack the jacket. It is really as simple as turning the left pocket inside out and then stuffing the whole jacket in to it. If you can't seem to get it you are overt thinking it."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Really prefer different jacket,3,It's a great jacket and I really don't like it.Pros:  Appears very waterproof from the tests I put it through. Plasticky material makes the water roll right off.  Zippered pockets.  Drawstrings for tightening.  Lightweight.Cons:  Size - bought a small but it's the size of a medium in both width and length. Feels like a tent.  Material - very stiff and noisy. The stiffness makes it feel even baggier.  Velcro - I don't prefer velcro over the zipper. It makes it less manageable and catches on other things.I found the waterproof rain jacket by Amazon Essentials to have all the pros without any of the cons above. It uses a more rubber-like material.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Great lightweight jacket, fit true to size.",5,I purchased this for my husband to use on our Alaskan Cruise.  It was a really great lightweight jacket.  It worked well with the rainy weather that we experienced in the trip.  Was light weight enough to wear even when not raining.  Ordered in size 2xl(his regular size) and it fit perfect.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great for and design,5,"I wanted a light jacket that matched the color of my beard. This was perfect. Look Columbia is a premium name  as the jacket what well made with extra Velcro closures, big hood and cool breathable lining.  Not going to help with -34 temps but for chilly nights on a walk it keeps you warm. I bet in 5 years I buy the pure white one.  My beard isn’t getting darker :("
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Sure, not the best color but great price for a rain shell from Columbia",5,"Paid about $20 for this and it will be perfect to pack for a trip to Seattle. Light weight, has pockets. hood closes tightly around neck. Sinching at waist. Just wanted something to fold into a backpack in case we end up in a little snow on mt ranier or out by the water front."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great rain jacket but runs a little larger,5,"Great raincoat. It is completely watertight. very lightweight and breezy enough that I could wear it in summer in Florida during heavy rain.  I usually wear Large sizes but with this rain jacket, I should've gone with Medium, the large looks and feel baggier on me."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,100% Waterproof,5,Just checked the fabric under the sink and water completely sheds off after a steady hard continuous stream. Seams look quality. Hood and bottom have adjustable pull strings. Super light and fully mesh lined. Great quality.  Wait for the price to drop on certain colors and it's a real value.
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Kept me dry and cool!,5,"I'm 26 and have never owned a proper rain jacket.. I always just wore hoodies. Glad I bought this because it's amazing. Bought knowing I was going to NYC on a rainy weekend a few weeks ago. It was hot, and pouring out. The coat was well ventilated to keep me cool, and the material was perfect keeping me completely dry! I wish I could say the same for my shorts.I'm 6'3"" about 190 lbs and this large fit me perfect with some decent space to spare. I've got long arms and the sleeves reached my wrist no problem."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Perfectly Dry and Cool !,5,"At the Price of around fifty bucks you can't go wrong!  It fits exactly as the size chart shows and it keeps you completely dry!  In addition, the hood fits nice and snug over the top of your head,with a brim just above your eyes that helps keep the rain from dripping into your eyes.  I have tried several different types of rain jackets, looking always for one to keep me dry and most importantly cool, because living in a tropical climate where it tends to rain a lot one needs a jacket that keeps them dry and cool and the Columbia Men's Watertight II Packable Rain Jacket is PERFECT!  I tried the NORTH FACE venture which is about twice the price there are some great features to the jacket however, it is a poorly made jacket.  At 99 dollars it is not worth it!  Why?  because the inside liner on the North Face delaminates within a year and flakes off making the jacket worthless, no thanks!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Run of the mill rain jacket, nothing special",3,"There's nothing particularly wrong with this jacket, nor anything particularly noteworthy. Has only two pockets, and the inner lining is rough mesh fabric. Toward the end of the inside of the sleeves, there's not even that (so if your arms are wet from sweat or rain it is clingy and uncomfortable). Returned to try to find one with a nicer lining (not because of anything wrong with it). Run of the mill jacket--> run of the mill middle rating of 3 stars."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Well made, great buy!",5,"I bought this for my boyfriend. When it arrived, I compared it to a women's Columbia rain jacket that I had (purchased directly from Columbia's website). I saw similarities in the lining and thickness and the ""Columbia"" lettering was the same. If this is a knock-off as many others are saying it's a very well-made knock-off with a very official-looking sales tag and appearance."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great Value for the Price,5,"Not only does this jacket look terrific, the pockets are big enough to carry a meal, binoculars, etc. but, shield you from the most common weather elements, especially if a person properly layers their clothing to the local weather reports for the jacket purpose. Likewise, it is light in weight for comfortable use during most seasons of the year."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Light weight slim-fit bomber jacket,5,Great light weight slim fit bomber. The material isn't all shiny like other bomber jackets. No exterior logos or weird decals. Definitely getting your money's worth with this purchase. Has interior flask pocket that can fit a cell phone with a 6 inch display no problem. It's thin so I don't recommend for extreme cold weather. This is more of a jacket for when you wanna look good and clean.  My chest is a size 40 and I'm 6'1. I purchased the large and it fit perfect to my preference. (See attached photos)
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Order one size up from your normal size,5,"I read the reviews and verified the sizing chart which helped. I'm 5'5 160lbs and the large fit me perfectly. The jacket isn't too thin or too thick, but exactly what I was looking for."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Sizes must have been adjusted - Order the sie you normally would,4,"I saw all the reviews from 2018, saying that the sizes run smaller than usual, however, I ordered a Large (I was a large T-Shirt) and the jacket fit me like I'd expect a large jacket to. However, I like my jackets snug, so I would prefer a medium.Many of the reviews recommend you go a size up, but I don't think that's needed anymore.4 stars because the zipper is SUPER bright and shiny against the black fabric, and it just LOOKS really cheap. Feels nice, with a bit of warmth. If I'd gotten a medium, and the zipper wasnt to so shiny, I would have been perfectly happy."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Almost...,4,"Jacket is lightweight, looks cool and feels well-made. It's definitely made for an average or slimmer build, though. For reference, I'm 5'6"" and 175lbs (mostly muscle). Using the one-size-up advice, I ordered an XL. Overall it actually looks pretty good. But it's a little snug across the chest/shoulders. So if you're about 5'6"" with an average build (and not broad shoulders) an XL will probably for you perfectly.I must warn though: the jacket does not have very much flex in it at all. If I were to buy it again I'd order 2 sizes up and get it tailored. Just my two cents."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,"Excellent jacket, just know your size",5,"I love the style and the silky smoothness this jacket brings. For the price, it can't be beat. Shipping takes a little while but worth the wait. Be sure to know your size. I'm 5'9""  160 lbs. With an athletic build, not bulky, and I got a U.S.A. medium which is an asian tag 3xl but that was a little too big. I got ahold of the seller and turns out I needed a U.S.A medium but with the asian tag 2xl which fits perfectly. By the way, customer service through email was very quick to respond,  and extremely helpful.  All in all this is a really cool jacket."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Damn I look good…,5,"I wasn’t sure what to expect with the price that was attached, but am very pleasantly surprised at the quality and fit of this jacket.Good length, the arms are long enough to not pull up immediately, the feel is nice and not too shiny like some bomber jackets, and the fit is damn near perfect, the pockets are all useful and spacious.And it’ll keep you warm which is surprising in itself because it’s pretty thin.The inside has this blue bandanna design which might get me jumped, but you can’t really see it when you wear it anyway, overall for the price this jacket is worth every penny.One nitpick is the zippers are a little flimsy, but it’s $30 so I can live with it."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Quality Jacket,5,"This is my second jacket from this company and every time I am surprised at the quality and great fit.  I am 6'0"" 145lbs and a medium was perfect.  Great looking jacket and not made of cheap materials."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Dig it,4,"I personally dig the shit out of this jacket, I live in California so it’s not to cold or hot out here so the jacket is comfortable. However the only downfall for me is that it does run a little small, luckily I’m tall and lean so it kinda worked out, also the zippers are shiny as hell and personally not really my style but I dig the jacket."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Fits really well and I really like the jacket,4,"Just received mine in the mail today. Arrived quicker than I expected. Fits really well and I really like the jacket. Not too thick, not too thin - just perfect, especially for someone who lives in California.I usually wear a small but ended up with a medium given what people have said about the fit and the M fits perfectly. I think I may be OK with a S but I didn't want to risk it. It does fit a bit snug when you zip it up. Overall, the jacket looks very nice and fits nice, so overall, I'm a happy camper. Would definitely consider buying products from them again."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Looks pretty good!,5,"I'm 5'8 and I weigh about 145 lbs and have a lean/slender build. My suit size is a 36S. The US Small size fits me really well! When it comes to jackets, the biggest problem I have is that the shoulders are often too wide for my frame, making me look like a kid wearing his dad's jacket, but this jacket fit my shoulders well. You may want to consider sizing up if you don't typically have that problem and ESPECIALLY if you have the opposite problem!It's an inexpensive jacket so the material feels super cheap to the touch, but thankfully, it doesn't LOOK super cheap,"
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Its slim but it works,4,Well i just got my jacket and pretty sweet its true to size but you gotta remember its going be a little tight on the arm and shoulders area. To be frank check your measurements guys if you want the perfect fit and it's reasonable price you can't go wrong. Yup im think buying another one
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Good quality..,5,"Very nice jacket. It's fits great and seems to be of a really good quality..So, I've had this jacket for awhile now and I love it. It still fits great and looks great. Nice amount of pockets and it's pretty warm for how light it is. I'd buy it again and I think I might get the Maroon one to be honest.."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,A tad small,4,"Just received my jacket today and so far I'm completely in love with it. I love the look and feel. Only probably is it runs small. I bought a medium and it feels like it could be a small. Luckily, I'm pretty skinny so it worked out but anyone of a bigger build, I'd suggest getting 1-2 sizes larger than you usually wear. Besides that, awesome jacket!"
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Good jacket,5,Love the jacket. It's really good. I got a 2X and that really fits really nice on me. Just a little bit of tip if you are trying to zip up the zipper and it gets kind of hard. Just lift up the jacket while you have it on. Just lift it up and then zip it up.
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Too tight!,1,"I ordered an XL. It fit as though it was two sizes too small. I stand 5' 10"" and weigh 230 pounds, with a solid physique. This Chinese-made jacket is simply not sized to fit Americans. I tried to send it back; they offered me half the cost of the coat if I would just keep it, so I did. Unless you are a small person, this coat is not going to work for you."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Perfect Gift,5,"I got this as a gift for my dads birthday. I first ordered him a large and the sleeves were a little too long, so I exchanged for the medium which fits him like a glove. The quality in this jacket is amazing as well. It looks more expensive than it actually was. Perfect to wear out or in a more casual setting."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Great Jacket,5,Got this for my son and it fits perfectly. It's well made and has awesome lining - it's a surprise!
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Not worth my money,3,"I bought this jacket for my vacation in Colombia. I tried it on and it fit well. However, upon arrival at Colombia, I wore it once and the inside is already torn. It was just a slight casual move to grab something and I hear the tear. I wont be buying it again."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,"nice design, but quality lacking",2,"Too bad, I really liked the look of this jacket and it was a great windbreaking layer. I even got several compliments on the look of it.However... the main zipper broke in like 3 places after only a week or two of wearing, and it's totally unusable now. :(Tailor quoted me $65 to fix it... so don't count on this lasting very long."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Bad quality,1,The stitching is incredibly cheap. The inside of the jacket tore within a week of owning the jacket.
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,the sizing,5,jacket fit perfect.  nice material the length  of sleeves  are just right.
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Too long,2,"It's ok, but the zipper is European and therefore backwards, and the jacket fits too long (XL), and I'm 6 feet tall."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Affordable price,5,It fits very well all together on my chest arms shoulders and waste.
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,"Stylish, well made",5,"I was pleasantly pleased with this jacket as I didn’t think it would look as good of quality as it does . It fits my son who is pretty lanky and y’all perfectly , like it was tailored for him. It’s very stylish and has stylish details with pockets and zippers . Great buy."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Exactly what I was looking for,5,I got this for my boyfriend. He’s 6’1 and 250 lbs and the 2XL fit him just right. I could’ve sized down to a XL for a tighter fit but he was satisfied with the size I got. I love the zipper detail on the sleeve and it has an inside pocket.
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,sizing is off,1,the sizing chart is way off on selecting size to order
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Jacket,5,"The product fit just fine on my brother. He has a more slender frame, but he is extremely tall, so I was worroed about the length of the sleeves. It fit perfectly in the end on the sleeves so I'm satisfied."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Not true to size,1,It says it's a slim fit jacket so I bought a 2 XL  Even that was too tight  Would be a nice jacket other than that
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,wrong size received,1,I ordered large and received small when using a tape measure to verify this after the unti was received.

URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Difference in color.,4,Love the styling of this jacket. If you're 6'4 like me I recommend getting an XL. Fits snug and comfortably. Material is little more like of a windbreaker. The pictures in the description don't really match. I bought the blue one hoping it be the same blue as described. Instead it's a little more on the dull gray side. I'd just go with the black one instead.

URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,"Ordered a large, any other large fits well. ...",1,"Ordered a large, any other large fits well. Was way too small, so I ordered a Xlg & was the same size as the large I still had to send back. My guess they are sewing a label on what they have & just sending it. They also want me to pay for shipping both of these jackets back."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Sleeves kind of short,4,"I am 5'10 and around 180. This jacket fits my body good. The only problem there is, the sleeves are a bit short. If I extend my arms or reach up in any way you can clearly see that the sleeve is a couple inches too short. The jacket itself is awesome and I love the color. I will probably end up buying another one, instead of buying large I will opt for an extra large."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,This color jacket fit me better than the black one,4,This color jacket fit me better than the black one. The black one had shorter sleeves and so it looked too short on me. Good looking jacket.

URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,"Zipper is on the left side (womans jacket). Way too small, no matter what.",2,"Looks good I got it 2 sizes bigger and it was still too small. My son has some big muscles but the biggest size didn't fit him. He's only 15. Also the zipper is on the left side... (AKA womens). It doesn't even fit me and I'm only 5'6"" American."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,next order was perfect!,2,First ordered jacket was to small...next order was perfect!
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Great jacket,5,"Bought the US M in burgundy.Color is great and matches pics.Fits well. I'm 5'8 140lbs and like slim fitting clothes. It fits well without being overly tight. I could layer a thin hoodie under it.The jacket won't keep you warm in cold weather but works well for florida ""winters"".Only con in the zipper. It catches and is not smooth at all. Considering the price and this being the only complaint 5 stars is fair."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Perfect bomber jacket,5,"I saw people commenting about the sizing so I looked up the measurement for a hoodie that fits me perfectly and they were the same for this bomber. When I got it, it fit me perfectly, so it is true to size. Very comfortable and looks nice. Not too big or puffy so that’s perfect. Only thing about it is that the zippers are really shiny, it almost looks like they have glitter on them. Besides that it’s a great jacket."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Runs VERY small,1,"Unless you have a six pack and no fat, this jacket will not fit you based on typical dimensions.Must be designed for only thin people."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Zipper on Wrong Side,2,Zipper is on the wrong side for a men’s jacket! That’s a shame because the quality is nice.

URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Quality isn't as terrible as I read it would be but it isn't ...,5,I'm a medium in US sizing and I ordered 3XL. Fits perfectly open or zipped up! Quality isn't as terrible as I read it would be but it isn't fancy for the price you pay for. Regardless I'm very happy with this purchase
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Five Stars,5,no complaints
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Order a size up.,5,Has a slim fit but order a size up like others have said. I'm 6'2 and 160lbs and the large fits great and doesn't billow around the waist.
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,DO NOT BUY,1,"When I first opened the package I knew right away something was wrong as the jacket was blue and I ordered black.  I went to try the jacket on and I couldn't even get my arms in it (and I am not overweight and fit for my size).  I looked for the tags in the jacket and first noticed that the Tommy Hilfiger imprint was crooked and parts of it shaded out which led me to believe this is a counterfeit item.  Also, the size tag was cut out and the other tag said it was navy in color but the paper tag attached to the sleeve said black XXL.  This isn't even close to being a medium as I had my son try it on.  Totally disappointed and Amazon should clearly inspect these as non-original product."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,"Warm & Smart looking, But the sleeves run long",4,"The Tommy Hilfiger is a smart looking looking fleece jacket that looks great on jeans and is is pretty warm and cozy as well. The fleece material is thicker and of better quality than what  you would typically find in a Fruit of the Loom or a Hanes Fleece Jacket. It fits well around the chest and has sufficient length , the only issue is that its sleeves run a bit long. I had to fold them up to use them  for my L sized jacket(I usually wear Large) . I've included the main measurements of this jacket for its 'Large' size in case you'd like to refer for sizingDESIGN & QUALITY- Full sleeved zippered jacket with a turtle neck & no hoodie- Two zippered front pockets as well as two inner pockets on either side- The turtle neck collar is double layered- The zippers glide smoothly and feel that they are of good quality- The piped design/stitching that runs across the chest and back looks much better in real life than in pictures alone and adds to its overall smart looks- Both the exterior and interior pockets are deep enough to fit wallets, keys , large cellphonesDIMENSIONS (SIZE: LARGE)Sleeves  :27"" InchesShoulder  :6.5"" InchesLength  :29.5"" InchesWidth chest  :24"" InchesTHE GOOD:- Smart looking jacket that pairs well with jeans and contrasting t-shirts , whether you zip half or all the way up- The thick fleece material and the double layered turtle neck makes the jacket very warm and cozy - sufficient for 48F ~ 50F weather without any additional layers- 4 Pockets and smooth flowing zippers- Fits well around the chestTHE NOT SO GOOD- The sleeves run long , I had to fold them in my day to day use (see pics)- The fleece + black color of my jacket is a magnet for lint and hair, an important consideration if you have pets (common with most fleece jackets)- The tags in the neck area can be bothersome if you're wearing round neck t-shirts- For these reasons I take away one starFINAL THOUGHTSOverall the Tommy Hilfiger fleece jacket is very smart looking, warm to wear and is better in terms of quality than other common brands. The only thing I would recommend considering is that the sleeves tend to run long and that it does attract a lot of lint and hair"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Stay away from this jacket,1,Stay away from this jacket... I purchased this jacket on the December 10 2019 and the Zipper is already falling apart. I lost 3 teeth already and the side pockets jam all the time. If I didn't know any better I would think this jacket is counterfeit. This is not the Tommy Hilfiger Quality
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Disappointed at the quality,2,"Now that the weather has turned cold, I've had a chance to wear this jacket a few times.  It looks nice and is warm enough, but the zipper is barely functional.  The quality is really poor and I expect it to not last very long.  The jacket is serviceable, but the quality is not what I have enjoyed with Tommy Hilfiger products and I suspect that it might be another of a long line of Amazon knock-offs.  Either way, I am disappointed and will be more careful about where I purchase apparel in the future."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,good fleece for long arms,4,"Great thick fleece. Warm. Good to 32 f in short duration. Great for 45+ long termSoft, comfortable, well made.Good fit in chest. I am 6' 195, 46"" chest, 36"" waist. 17 neck 34 sleeve.Very long sleeve on this, only negative. Covers most of my hand. Probably made for the tall alien's from close encounters movie. an under-served market i suspect.Other than that, great for the price."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Runs big,5,"This full zip sweater runs big but after getting a size smaller, it fits perfectly. Love the quality and thickness of the material. Im 5'8 180lbs usually wear a M but size Small here fits great for me"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Zipper Broke after 3 uses!,1,Zipper broke after wearing the jacket for just 3 times.I bought this jacket for my husband so that he could wear it winter but the zipper broke right after. I accepted better quality from Tommy!
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Not the fit I was looking for,3,"I'm approximately 5'10"" and 160lb. For reference a Columbia or Calvin Klein medium fit me perfectly. The arms on this are extremely baggy and hang down over my hands. The bottom of the fleece and arms also lack any sort of elastic to keep them snug. It has a very loose fit overall. The jacket is warm and the fleece is fluffy but the main zipper feels cheap. I personally will stick to other brands in the future."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Could be better,3,"I'd give this 5 stars except for 2 things.  First, there is no elastic in the sleeves, and no way to adjust them, so the sleeves constantly fall down over my hands.  Secondly, this material is the kind that attracts hair, so if there are animals around, you will be covered."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Perfect gift for my 16 year old nephew,5,"Bought the large for my 16 year old nephew. He absolutely loves it (the red one) and is always finding reasons to wear a jacket in Florida. It looks well fitted, the material is quite posh, and the small (not flashy) logo makes it perfect for young and young but well seasoned."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Comfortable and warm,4,"Comfortable and warm as is or under a light jacket.Would have given it five stars if the finishing was better.  There were a number of 1-2"""" threads that had to cut off around the zipper, almost as if this was a factory-second."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Comfortable,4,"This Polar Fleece jacket has a nice feel when you put it on. Good for cooler days, medium weight and no huge Logo like so many of these type jackets have. 5'8"" 170 lbs. I bought Medium fits perfectly"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Looks Stylish!,5,"My husband typically wears a men’s  medium or a large in jackets, but decided on the medium based on reviews. It was a perfect fit! He has a thin build and the jacket looks very sharp on him. The jacket is well made and he has enjoyed it for almost two weeks now. It has gone through the wash on gentle and been fine. I am pleased with it."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Jacket,3,"This is a ""Light Weight"" jacket not heavy like others I own It is more of a spring early summer weight defiantly not winter."

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Quality,5,"Prompt delivery, good quality."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,It's not that thick of a jacket,5,I had a similar jacket  years ago that had thicker material. The jacket I had previously kept me warmer than this one. The quality is good but just know that the jacket is geared to be worn in the spring and the fall instead of the winter as strictly an outer jacket due to the thinner material.

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Runs Big,4,Nice stylish fleece jacket.  It runs big so I recommend going down a size.  I usually where a medium. I purchased both a small and medium.  The small fit just right.  Not only was the medium not the right fit the arms like a lot of people have said are extremely long.  The sleeve basically covers my hand.  If you get the right size you'll be happy.

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,"Warmth, styling, a good basic freece jacket.",5,"My husband absolutely loves this Polar Fleece jacket and the way it zips all the way from hemline to the top to form a type of turtleneck collar.  The size Large fits him well except that the sleeves are a little too long and he has long arms.  We were both surprised by that.  There isn't enough added length to the sleeves, maybe 1/4 inch, so he just accepts the jacket the way it is.  I suggest ordering your usual size.  This is a warm jacket because the fleece is a good quality fabric.  The hemline is loose, not fitted to the body and without a drawstring closure.  That makes the jacket look more dressy, less totally casual.  There are two zippered pockets on the front of the jacket and a pouch pocket on the inside of the jacket on the right and left side.  This way anything you want to be kept securely in place can be put into the zipper pockets and other items carried in the pouches.  The zip pocket and the pouch are located together on the jacket, just one inside and one outside.  There is a Tommy Hilfiger symbol on the top left side of the front, but it barely shows up because it is so small and the colors are dark enough to almost blend completely with the dark gray color of the jacket we have.  I'm sure it would show more prominently on a lighter color jacket.This jacket is wash in cold water, dry on low heat.  It comes out of the dryer looking like it's brand new.  This is one of those in between weights of jackets which can be worn indoors if your home is a little cooler during the winter or as a light jacket for outdoors wear.  Either way it is very stylish looking and quite attractive."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,"Versatile, warm, and comfy",5,"The sleeves surprised me that they're so long ... but I *really* like this top. It's VERY comfy.  To deal with the sleeves, I roll up them up just a bit and they actually stay that way all day.  Know that this top *does* run a bit large.  A ""large"" normally runs a tad tight on me, and a extra large can be a bit loose, but this large top fits like a slightly slim extra large.  So - for me, it fits great!You could wear this as a sweater/jacket over a shirt, or, just wear it as if it were a fleece hoodie that doesn't have a hood.  That's how I wear it.  There's a nice facing behind the zipper that provides a nice look -- zip the zipper up most of the way and the collar looks pretty sharp.I also like the pockets -- they're deep, and the zippers give me confidence in knowing that my phone won't fall out. The inside pockets are deep (there are two) are deep, as well.I should add that my wife likes it, too, saying it looks ""nice"" and ""classy.""  I was going to give this four stars because the size is a tad large and the sleeves are a tad long. But if you know that going in, you'll know how it will fit.  For me, it fits great and I deal with the sleeves simply by rolling them up an inch or so. It's a versatile top that I can wear throughout the day inside and out, with no need to put on a jacket, even when the temperature is below freezing."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Best quality and brand name for this price,5,"Overall 4.5/5Yes, there are several brands and designs for fleece jackets, and yet this stands out. Several pluses:  - Very well made - high quality fleece and tailored well  - Double layered collar  - good quality zipper  - zippered pockets (2) outside and 2 open pockets inside  - Even the black one looks better in person than the photos in the Amazon. Looks classy  - longer cuffs/sleeves. I consider it as a plus since I have long hands and like to cover my hands when I go out in the winter.The only negative thing I see is the tags in the neck side. Now most attire is coming with no tags, and I am surprised to see protruding tags in a brand name like this.Compared to the standard fleece you get this is quite warm, being thicker.In all great buy for the winter/fall"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,A nice fleece jacket with style,5,"The Tommy Hillfiger Men's classic zip front polar fleece jacket is made of good quality, heavier than usual, fleece.  My son loves this jacket.  He is very tall and thin and (although others thought the sleeves too long) the sleeves are just right for him.  The jacket has a good quality zipper that doesn't get hung up on the fleece.  It has two zippered pockets on the outside so things are secure and there are 2 more pockets on the inside .  The pockets are deep and not skimpy at all.  The jacket comes with a turtleneck collar that you can pull up if it gets really cold or windy.  This is very handy for those windy afternoons. Even though the jacket is fleece, it has a more upscale or stylish look than those other fleece garments.  The jacket should be washed in cold water (not sure why because polyester doesn't shrink) and dried on low heat.  I think it washed up beautifully and looks just like new after washing."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,"Beautiful, feels great, but too long in the sleeves.",4,"When I think of fleece, I think of warm, but not necessarily thick fabric. The other fleece jacket liners I've had have been rather thin.This jacket feels like it's the thickest fleece there is. There's a double layer of fleece around the neck, and it feels superb.Zippered pockets are on either side of the front, and a open bucket pocket is on the inside at the bottom.It's an excellent jacket, and one if it fits right, will be the comfy, go-to-jacket...when it's not raining.But if it doesn't fit well...Two things:There's two things that aren't great. It's too long in the sleeves (medium), and the zipper catches. It's like the plastic teeth need to be broken in. The zipper and zipper teeth are large, and maybe that has something to do with it.Other than that, it's a very fine jacket, and oh so comfy."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,size MEDIUM fits more like a LARGE,3,"Unfortunately for me, this jacket is way too large. I weigh 160 pounds and wear size medium from most American brands. This size MEDIUM jacket is way too big around the body and the arms are also much too long. I have some size LARGE jackets that are smaller than this.If you do get the right size, this jacket is made from a good quality poly fleece - smooth and tightly woven. Construction quality is pretty standard with a boxy fit. There is no wind or water protection, so you need to wear another jacket over this in bad weather. The list price of $160 is unrealistic. Similar quality brand-name jackets from Columbia, etc. are much cheaper."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,This is a really nice looking fleece zip up jacket,4,"This is a really nice looking fleece zip up jacket, but the fit is a bit large. I wear a large t-shirt, and thought a medium in this jacket would be a perfect fit. It is a bit loose on me, and the arms are a bit longer than I expected. Not a deal killer as the jacket looks great and is ultra warm, but probably best to order a size down from whatever you were looking for.The fleece is fairly thick, so it is a lot warmer than fleece jackets I have worn in the past.  I wear it to work with a shirt and tie, and it looks great.The Tommy Hilfiger logo is super small, which is nice if you, like me, do not like advertising for the company that made your clothes while you walk around in them."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Loving this fleece X3,5,"I'm really loving this fleece jacket. First, it's stylish in a minimalist design ethic, typical of Hilfiger. Second, I can wear it as a casual or business casual piece that fits lots of dress styles (for me). Third, living in the PacNorWest, a light raincoat is pretty common attire, but the weather can also be a bit chilly for my light rain jacket. This fleece is the perfect layer under the raincoat...add that it is black and matches the fleece and I've got a perfect pair.Functionally, the zipper is smooth, the pockets are spacious. The arms are a little long for my build, but that might just be me. Otherwise, I think this is a perfect coat. Love Hilfiger."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Warm and comfortable but runs a bit large,4,"Very comfortable and warm fleece. The style is very basic: black with the Tommy logo on the left breast. It has a secure zipper that goes all the way up and turns the collar up when zipped all the way. Since I have a few other Tommy items I expected this to fit like those do but was surprised that this large is a bit larger than the others (both around the midsection and in the length of the arms). Perhaps this is to account for the idea that you may be wearing this over other items of clothing, but it makes the fleece feel a bit bulky. Otherwise it's an ideal fleece and definitely keeps you warm."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Soft comfortable fleece.,5,"Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket is a soft comfortable fleece that fits well, but the sleeves are quite long. If the sleeves were on the short side, I'd consider it an issue. I actually like the longer sleeves because they can cover my hands if I want them too. Other than that, it's also well made and fairly warm. The zippered pockets are deep which I really like. This is an all around quality fleece, and I like it a lot."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,"Fits well, runs a tiny bit large",4,"I didn't expect this to fit my husband as well as it does, he typically wears an XL. So this fitting the way it does leads me to believe it runs a bit large with a generous cut. It looks great, very stylish. The pockets are a nice touch. The fleece does attract lint, pet hairs, etc. but doesn't seem to pill much so far. The price point really isn't that off the mark, in my opinion."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,We all love Hilfiger in this house and this fleece is no ...,5,We all love Hilfiger in this house and this fleece is no exception. It is a zip fleece w zippered pockets. It is a slim fit but fits well and will fit under a winter coat. It is very high quality especially for such a low price. It is worth double that.
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Tommy Hilfiger Classic Polor Fleece,5,I got this for my cousin in Chicago. He is tall and slender and the fit is great. He likes that the sleeves come down to about the middle I'd his hands. It helps keep him warmer. He did have the sleeves turned up when he showed it to me. It is not big snd bulky but it is nice snd warm snd very comfortable. He's in college and he says it's become his everyday jacket. He can even ware it under a heavier coat when necessary. It's a great looking fleece jacket and turned out to be a great Christmas gift!
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,"Cheap materials, runs small, no shoulder taper",3,"I ordered this jacket as part of a Star Lord costume for Halloween. I figured it would make a nice windbreaker afterwards with how nice it looked on the picture. Upon arrival I immediately noticed some undesirable things. For one the color is a couple shades lighter than what the picture shows. And there is absolutely no padding in the shoulders nor are the shoulders sewn to give you any sort of shape like what is shown in the picture. That's not a bad thing if you have broad shoulders, but it can be disillusioning to see yourself wearing a scrunched up red coat if you don't. The biggest issues I faced were the material and the size though. The material was cheap and sounded/looked like I was wearing a big red trash bag. As for the size, I'm broad shouldered and have a fairly large chest but this item runs thin; very New York fashion. So if you do decide to order, make sure you go a size or two above what you think you are."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,"Stylish, light, and affordable jacket",5,"I was skeptical when the package was delivered because the jacket was pretty thin in the delivery bag, but I was pleased when I opened it up and saw how nice it was.Definitely a light jacket that does not provide much warmth, but stylish and great for the price! Used initially for a starlord costume, and has already been used for casual wear. Great and affordable light jacket, looks really great on."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Looks exactly as pictured.,5,"Looks exactly like the photo. I was nervous based on the other reviews, but I’m very pleased. Bought this for Star Lord costume. Deep red, not flashy bright red. Perfect for my needs. Would and will make a fun jacket either way."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,"Not bad, looks and feel nice.",3,"Definitely won't keep you warm. Wear a hoodie under it or something.""Made in China"" <--- Which means it is cheaply made. I wish Amazon would let us know where stuff comes from. I am tired of seeing ""Made in China"" everywhere, after you receive the item..."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Best jacket on Amazon,5,"I look like an artist with this jacket! Damn! Best product ever! I totally recommend it. I got the blue one and with this jacket, you will have all those girl touching you and liking you with this badass jacket! WHOOAH!!!"
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Good quality and price,5,"Looks great, just like in the photos. Especially great for the price, most of these cheaper sellers on Amazon sacrifice quality but that’s not the case here. Just like a department store brand."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Good for costume but not as pictured,3,"I ordered this for my husband for our family’s Guardians of the Galaxy Halloween costumes. I think if I had ordered for casual wear I would be a lot more disappointed but for a Star Lord costume it’s a good price and the quality is decent for photos and trick or treating.-My husband has broad shoulders and an athletic build; this fit him true to size-The lining is not as pictured. The jacket we received has a bright purple patterned lining that’s really unattractive with the red color jacket, but if you wear it zipped the whole time this becomes kind of a nonissue.-As other reviewers have mentioned, the color is more of a bright red than the darker red pictured.-The jacket is also definitely thin. I would agree with another reviewer that it’s a cheap plastic material not far off from a trash bag but again - for a costume, it’s fine."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,I like the Jacket,4,"I like the Jacket. Bought it for my StarLord costume, but the more I wore it, the more I liked it. Confortable, warm, and fits great. Only thing is I don't like the design on the tricept area, looks wierd with the krisscross stitching. Otherwise no problems with it."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Su calidez!,5,Muy buen productoo
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Very Stylish & Beautiful Jacket!!!,5,"This a very nice jacket, I am 6'2"" 265 and the XXL fit me nicely. I received the jacket on the same day that I attended a friends B-day party and received numerous compliments. People wanted to know where I purchased it. I just ordered the same jacket in black yesterday. Living in the Northeast, this is going to be a great fall jacket to wear with a turtleneck, t-shirt or dress shirt. I love this jacket!"
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,"Great style, low quality",4,"I'm a 6'2 male with a small frame and the medium fit me perfectly. Out of the box it fit super nice and got a lot of compliments on it. Unfortunately, after about a month or two the inner pocket started ripping and is unusable now. Otherwise a great jacket but would've appreciate a little more quality in the jacket. And don't count on warmth from this jacket either. Great jacket otherwise."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,It's summer now so Will know how good it is after August or September eh,3,"It's not as bright as pic . Very thin material.. only partially faux leather- I don't think you can wear any sweater or sweat shirt under..it's a good jacket for spring$; or when it's not too cold out$! Do like The pockets, pockets have zippers$; so u can secure valuables 💰.. wallets &! Wish the length was few inches longer. It fits top of my belt$;"
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,picture doesnt show enough,4,"PROS:- nice leather-nice pockets-heavy zippers-good fit, tiny bit too largeCONS:-shoulders and sleeves are brighter and have a diamond patteren on them, wasnt really a fan, couldnt see it in the picure online though- inside pattern doesnt go well with it, so be concious if you unzip it"
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,This jacket is not worth $30,1,"this is not a $30 dollar jacket, save yourself the time of having to return this after you buy it and are disappointed. the inside of the jacket is the same crappy material as the out side and is pure black all throughout. the jacket does not have the inner zipper pocket either, and the zipper itself is cheap plastic. im sure if you kept this jacket for at least three months the zipper would start breaking. go to old navy look for a slightly higher price jacket that will be nicer quality and last you a lot longer than this jacket ever will."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,"Great, comfy jacket",5,My son totally loves it and refuses to take it off
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,A pretty decent jacket.,4,"I get compliments wearing it so that's gotta mean something, right?Although it took an eternity to ship from China when it arrived it was ready to wear and devoid of obvious defect. Fit was not as expected. If you want a stylish blue item to add to your ensamble this will do fine, next time I'll be hoping to get something that fits me a but more perfectly."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,What did i just buy?!,2,"Okay.... the red one is what i bought...... i look like Michael J Fox from 1980 (not what i was going for) it shows a cool dark red online, but make no mistake it is vibrant red like think, red corvette.The only reason i give it 2 stars is now i have a cheap halloween costume for later this year."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Good Jacket. Fit as expected.,5,This was a good jacket for the money. Stylish. Water proof. Fit nicely.  It's thick enough to keep you warm on cool spring/fall nights. Material seems to be of good quality. The most important feature for me is that the sleeves were a good length for my arms.
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Stylish Light jacket!,5,"So I did some digging like always before I purchase and I bought a size up from what I usually get and it worked out perfectly. I am 5’11 200lbs and the XL fit me very well. I’ve gotten so many compliments on it. Has a decent size pocket inside the left breast of the jacket too. I wouldn’t necessarily use this in a winter storm, but for your more mild cold-chilly conditions this is a definite go to! Would recommend!!"
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Don’t Bother,2,"The picture looks cute, and that’s about as good as this jacket gets. The leather on the sleeves is a much brighter red than in the picture, which looks terrible, and the jacket itself is not as fitted as the picture would have you think. The tailoring is very poor."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Inspect material in photos before buying. All in all not a bad coat.,4,"This jacket was good for the purpose I bought it for- a Fight Club costume. I will mention it is very red, not as deep burgundy/ maroon as seller photos show. Also worth noting- it’s not entirely leather. The front and back have a windbreaker material while sides and sleeves are the leather material."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Looks different in person,1,"Looks nothing like star lord, unless u have low expectations on everything In life. Cheap material. Looks like something a grandma would wear in the 80s. Windbreaker type crap."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,THIS IS A WINDBREAKER WITH PLASTIC SHOULDERS,1,"Misrepresented as a ""leather"" jacket. This is a windbreaker with plastic shoulder pads. If this is ""the look"" you want, it's just fine. Durable for the price, and the lining is nice. Otherwise, it's a garbage jacket."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Waaaaaay too small,2,"Bought this as a Halloween costume. Was no where near the right size. Ordered a 2x and it was more like a medium-large. So, even though it says men’s size. If you buy I would imagine the sizes to be more for youth/children. Not worth my time and $ to return. Sad day."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Too Small but great jacket if you fit in it.,5,This is a great jacket but I take a 2x and I ordered a 2x and this would not make it around my waist to zipper up.
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Great bomber jacket!,5,Like this a lot! Stylish and comfortable and light to wear. Perfect for a light breeze. Classic looking. Love the red color and leather accents on the sleeves.
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Great Quality Jacket,5,"Received the jacket a couple days ago and I'm quite pleased. From a look it seems like a quality a jacket that costs a lot. While the feel of it can prove to be cheap, the look is really nice. I haven't used it in the rain so I'm not too sure how water will effect it but my assumption is that it can handle the water. Size-wise I'm 5'8"" and pretty skinny. I purchased a small and its a little small but for me any bigger would've been to baggy. All in all I'm pretty happy about the jacket"
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,2XL,4,"Nice jacket, but a bit slim. I'm 6'4 1/2 295.. I like my clothes to fit, but this is a bit snug. But a nice jacket"

Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Don’t buy it.,1,"The jacket is labeled as a slim fit, but really it’s just too small. I used the sizing chart and ordered according to my measurements and it was far too small. The material and shape of the jacket was also nothing like what the pictures show. It looked like a cheap knock off of what’s shown in the pictures. Needless to say, I returned the jacket and will not order again."

I thought I was buying what was pictured, an all black jacket with checkered patterned inside."

Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Came with free Amazon OpsTechIT logo,4,"Was I supposed to get the Amazon OpsTechIT logo on this jacket? I don't mind, I'll just be wearing it around the house, but just be aware that the $30 jackets may come with logos you didn't expect."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Great quality, looser, relaxed fit",5,"I just tried it on and really like it.  Great quality.  The collar can be zipped up or it can lay flat like a traditional jacket.  The large size fits me great.  I like the strong and thick elastic near the wrists.  (The sleeves don't just hang.)  It's a little loose in the chest and arms, but that's fine with me, as I like a more relaxed fit.  The two interior pockets are pretty loose, but are deep and would hold a lot.To give a better idea of the fit, I'm 6'3"" and 185-190 lbs.  So, tall and skinny with long legs.  If the length of the torso material was any shorter, I'd search for a size large tall.  I hope this helps someone :-)"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Felt, not fleece",2,"While the cut and stitching are good, the fabric is not really fleece, but rather a kind of felt:  ""A cloth or stuff made of matted fibers... fulled or wrought into a compact substance by rolling and pressure  ... without spinning or weaving."" The inside fibers are loose, not firmly attached: I can pinch them into a clump with my fingers. I attach photos comparing this coat with my 10 year old Columbia fleece.  I wondered if this is one of the counterfeits people mentioned.  This review describes the fabric, with a photo of the interior that looks like what I received: ""The inner face of the fabric has a felt-like feel that’s very soft and the outside is a low-pile shaggy fleece (think Mountain Hardwear Monkey Man, but less shaggy). ... After a couple weeks of wear and two nights on the trail, the Steens Mountain is still in great shape, even with me: a notorious spiller and snagger.""  Perhaps it is actually o.k.?"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Looks great, the price was great, doubt it’s real Columbia.",5,"I ordered this for my boyfriend. I ordered a large. First of all, I was so pleased because it arrived the next day after I ordered it. It was supposed to arrive tomorrow or on Saturday, but it just arrived a few minutes ago. He has not tried it on yet, he will in a bit, but I can already tell the large will be a bit roomier on him. He has really long arms so my concern is whether this will cover his arms. If the body fits well, usually the sleeves are a few inches too short. He does typically wear Large. The stitching looks fine, don’t see anything wrong with it. I do agree that the material is not actually fleece, it’s fleece-like. Feels thin but warm. Isn’t super fluffy, which is fine. My order says made in Bangladesh, which the reviews keep saying is the better quality zip-up in comparison to the ones that say made in China.If I don’t forget, I will update the review once he wears it a few times and once it’s washed to see how it holds up. But so far, other than it being fleece-like, it looks great for the price.I don’t know if it’s real Columbia though. I typically wear north face fleeces so I don’t even know what Columbia’s fleeces feel like. I doubt it’s the real thing.UPDATE 12.29.18: it fits him well, it’s very warm. He wears it almost every day when it’s colder outside. Has been washed a few times, still looks fantastic. Did lose the shiny new look after being washed, but it still does the job. We ended up buying the same one except black at TJMaxx for his brother for Christmas. Sometimes I wear it myself because it’s big and cozy; perfect for chilly days or lazy mornings."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Fits a few sizes smaller than listed.,2,"Shiping was fast due to Prime and the item was true color, but not true to size. I am extremely disapointed with this fleece jacket. I normally wear a 3XL or 4XL and i know fleece jackets can fit tight sometimes so i wanted one I could be comfortable i , one with some extra room. So I ordered a 5XL....nope this thing fits lile its a 3XL, the sizing is wayyyy off. I look like an overstuffed chimichanga."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"2XL/Tall fits well for 6'5"" 280 lbs broad shoulders",4,"I got black but the black is a sort of matte black (dark, dark graphite).After reading some of the reviews, I decided to order the 2XL/Tall instead of my normal 3XL/Tall and it's a good fit.I'm 6'5"", 280 lbs, with broad shoulders and carry a bit of weight in the belt, but the 2XL/Tall fits well without being too tight.The Steens jacket isn't the warmest or the best but I got it to throw on, look good, and knock the chill off 40F+ and it works well."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Not lined!,3,"It appears to be a good, lightweight jacket.  However I my biggest complaint with it is that it is NOT LINED  This causes it to stick to EVERY single shirt I wear when I put it on or take it off!  AND, wind just cuts right through it because it has no lining.  This morning going into work it was 37 with a moderate breeze.  My teeth were almost chattering by the time I walked the hundred feet from the parking lot to the front door.  It was like I wasn't even wearing a jacket!  Add a lining to help eliminate wind passing through and to keep it from sticking to shirts and it would be almost perfect."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,A warm versatile fleece for spring and fall or for layering in winter,4,"The jacket was delivered as ordered and shipped as estimated. The fleece feels very soft and a decent weight. I bought the large and it fits perfectly. Not too baggy and not too tight. I am 6 ft 1 in and 190 lb and athletic build. I bought this as a winter liner for another outer jacket. Note that this is not an interchange liner fleece, as it doesn't have the correct zipper to zip into an outer jacket. That detail was not important for me though. I already own a Columbia fleece jacket from a few years back that i use for outside projects on the home in mild and colder conditions, and i have always managed to stay warm with low to medium activity level. I have been so impressed with it i wanted to buy a second one. I compared the new one with the older one and both have the same retail number. However, the seams inside the new jacket are not finished in the same way or as neatly as the older one. The new jacket is made in Sri Lanka but the older one is made in Vietnam. I have noticed a similar thing regarding quality of finish with other clothing manufacturers. Where things are made really does seem to matter. This issue is very minor and doesn't show on the outside and looks like a quality fleece when you wear it. There is an elastic draw cord and toggle for people like me who like to cinch around the waist. The older jacket had two, this has only one on the left side. Works the same. Pockets have zippers all YKK and little cords that you can attach to make opening and closing with gloves easier. All in all a good product, but i personally wouldn't pay the full price of $60 for it, i got it at half price on sale and am happy with that."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Great Jacket, buy according to Columbia size chart.",4,"Great fleece jacket, fits well and sleeves are just my size. I'm 6'0"" and 174 lb slim built but broad shouldered and a Medium fits me great. Warm and comfortable fleece, light weight. Only issue is Amazon shipped the wrong color, I ordered black and I received dark Gray. Decided to keep it anyway because I liked the color. Quality jacket at a great price.Note: This particular Steens Jacket is the 2.0 updated version even though I ordered the original old version. Seems Amazon sells both as same style. I don't believe they have much difference in style. But I got packets with zippers and draw string at the Hem. those might be the updates of the 2.0. I wasn't expecting zip pockets."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Fake!,1,"This is a counterfeit Columbia fleece. First off, not fleece, secondly, it smells like chemicals, third the tag is sewn on the front and not embroidered, the zipper pulls are not the ones Columbia uses. I’ve seen fake North Face Fleeces on eBay but never from something as inexpensive as Columbia.  The material is so cheap I bet it won’t last through more than 2 washes and will pill up immediately. Also smells like it gives you cancer."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Fabric has changed from previous purchases,2,"This fleece jacket fits OK but . . . and it's a big but. The quality of the fleece has changed. I have worn this style jacket from Columbia since the fall of 2016. I've purchased several in that time and the softness of the fleece has been good and remained the same. This jacket--just purchased in Feb. of 2020--has a flatter and harder finish--much like some of the cheapest fleece available in fabric stores--rather than the softest fleeces available as yardage. I am a plus size woman, purchase the men's 2X because it's longer than a women's 2x. I'm very fussy about the feel of the fabric.Yesterday I checked a sporting good's store where I had made my first purchase of this style of Columbia fleece in Oct. of 2016. I found that there were some of the older fabrics jackets available as well some in this newer and much less desirable fleece. I will keep this one rather than going through the return process. However, this is my last fleece purchase from Columbia--through Amazon--and my last purchase of any fleece unless I can actually feel the fabric."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Zipper ok, steens a few years ago bad zippers",5,"This is my 4th steens. The first 2 didn't make it a year without zipper problems. But the price is so good for the good design that i thried a third. Boring colors this year, but real happy with it and the zip didn't mess up after careful use the first month so i got another one, but Navy . It is the navy that looks best, and it is also feeling like a good enough (not great zipper) and so for the price it was a good choice. The color is really good for this year's choices. For under $40 (sometimes under 30) it is worth it. For 60 not. The hem cord can draw tight in the cold, the big inside pockets can carry a scarf ."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Good jacket, yet different than they used to be.",4,"I gave 4 stars just because this jacket isn’t as good as the one I got a couple years ago, same brand and style. Like with anything else, things change to be made cheaper, yet the price stays the same or goes up of course. I still like the jacket, and I’m definitely keeping it. Just know that if you’re getting this to replace the same thing, it will be a little different. The main difference is they’re thinner than they used to be, also a little shorter. I always bought the regular length before, but since I prefer the length to be lower than my waist, I had to return the first one I ordered and exchange it for the tall size. Overall though, it’s still a nice jacket."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,A BEAUTIFUL GARMENT,5,"Well constructed, fits well, very fashionablecolor,strong zipper and convenient sipper pockets. The color I chose is very servicable and good appearing. The word ""mountain"" is misleading. This is a mid-weight fleece that will be comfortable in temperatures above 40 degrees F. But if you make the mistake of considering this jackets weight adequate for ""mountain"" temperatures in the middle of winter, you are going to freeze your posterior off. But you'll look very fashionable doing it. As the survival team retrieves your frozen body atop the mountain they might say, ""He's frozen as solid as a door nail but he sure dressed well."" It was fabricated in Shrilanka and comes with a MSRP of $65. It's a $30 garment at best at retail. So don't be swayed by exaggerated regular prices, false savings or to good to be true sale prices. Above $30 bucks, and make sure it is shipped free, you have paid too much in my opinion."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Nothing beats a Columbia fleece!,5,"Fits exactly the same as another Columbia fleece I bought at a sporting goods brick&mortar. The one that I received is a genuine Columbia. Some reviews claim that they might not have received an authentic Columbia. I can't speak for them, but compared to the one I've had for years, it's exactly the same and is legit. I got mine direct from Amazon, not a third-party seller.I ordered the black one. It's not BLACK-black, almost a charcoal-black, which is fine by me. If you want black-black, you might have to fork over the additional $70 for a North Face fleece (not worth it imo, and I own a few of them). I paid $45 for the Columbia I bought at the brick&mortar, so I'm very pleased that I saved so much $ buying it on Amazon."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Form fitting and one third the price of the ""name brand"" fleece",5,"I needed to get a fleece because I (ahem) outgrew my ""name brand""  fleece.  This fleece is 1/3rd the price of the ""name brand"" fleece.  It fit pretty well. The fleece material is a little thinner, but I find it covers more of my body so the warmth is pretty consistent.The Columbia fleece does not have a breast pocket like the ""name brand"" fleece.  Also the zip pockets are a little smaller and placed a little more to the rear.  The zipper doesn't seem to be as substantial.The Columbia has a draw string at the bottom to keep the fleece closer in to the waist which the ""name brand"" did not have.  So you can order a little larger size and not have to worry about an artic blast coming up from below your waist.However, considering I can buy three of these Columbia fleeces for the price of one ""name brand"" fleece, I can accept the fact that the fleece is a little thinner and perhaps a little lower quality, but actually insulates my body a little better as it's more form fitting.Five stars, now lets hope it stands up to 6 months of the year wear for a couple of years."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Weird sizing! Too big or too small, and nothing in between.",3,"The physical quality of the fleece and jacket structure is really great. It is warm and it doesn't feel cheap. But the sizing seriously is a problem. I typically wear a large in almost all shirts and jackets. With that said, I originally ordered a large and then returned it for a medium. I am reviewing both.Size large is like wearing a tent: The body is impressively baggy and the sleeves are too long (which is a problem I've never had, being a fairly tall individual with lanky arms); I had to triple-check that I hadn't accidently ordered an XL. I then ordered a medium. The sleeves were an acceptable length... but the fit was actually quite snug I wasn't able to layer any more shirts underneath it, which isn't acceptable for a piece of outerwear. Plus, if I gain a little more weight, I won't be able to fit in it at all.I'm disappointed that there is such a big discrepancy between oddly sized jackets. My only analogy is Goldilocks and the Three Bears: One size is too big, the next size is too small... and there is no size that is ""just right!"""
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Black is more like a Dark Gray.,4,"I have purchased many of these Columbia jackets in the past and this one is OK but the black is not a true dark black as in the past. It is almost a dark gray especially when I hold it up to another black same style Columbia jacket from a local retail store. Maybe these are rejects, blems or seconds? It almost looks as if the dye ran out while manufacturing the material. Oh well the jacket fits nicely and is still a great value just not the dark color you expect when they say black.  Deducted 1 star for poor color otherwise a five star product."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Amazing piece of clothing at a good price!,5,"Okay so for the buyer looking in the reviews, There’s a lot of people on here that don’t know a ton about clothing & i have too say first hand it’s a fleece jacket so things like too stick too it but no problem a quick wipe will take care of anything on it, It’s made of fleece so it’s a shiny BLACK not a jet black so put that into perspective, There’s a bungee tightened for the bottom of the jacket so you can adjust it too just how tight you want it too fit & look, The sleeves are cuffed at the wrist for a good fit, Extremely soft, Go get your size in dimensions then buy your clothing don’t go by the sizing names!Every company has there own sizing & you need the dimensions of what you wear, chest size is all you really need the rest should fit fine, The zippers are nice & sleek, there’s bungee ties on the zippers for a easier grasp, you can easily take them off or put them on if they come off, they just wrap around the zipper, Overall 8.5/10 for look, 10/10 for quality"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Perfect,5,Great fit. Great price! Much thicker and warmer than I thought it would be.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Ripped/Unstitched on First Wash,2,"Super disappointed in my purchase! As a big fella it’s hard to find something comfy from such brands that actually fits good. I always wash any clothes purchases before wearing. First wash I did it came out of the dryer ripped in two different locations. Didn’t come stitched properly by any means. The inside of my front pocket lost its stitch, so I can’t use the zippered pocket because it’s a straight hole right through. Also, the inside of my left wrist, where the stitch overlaps the elastic that grips your wrist also went out. In my area we just had a cold front hit and I had to wear this jacket due to it being my only jacket at the moment and I’ve dropped my phone through the front pocket countless times because as the day goes on I forget that I have a hole in my brand new jacket. I thought I had found the perfect jacket but seems like I got robbed of my expectations."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Great purchase for $20,5,"Purchased on sale for $20. They only had like 2 of the colors on sale and neither were my favorite but what they did have was one in a 4xl tall size. Now i don't ever wear anything in a 4x, at 6'4"" and 265lbs most of my clothing is a 2xl but when it's cold out and you've already layered and undershirt, with a t-shirt, and a long sleeve shirt and sometimes even a hoodie on top of all that this big & tall 4 xxl is just what I needed to be able to add another layer and not look or feel like the little kid on the Christmas story. Raplhys little brother should get one of these because i still have enough room to feel nice and loose and relaxed with it on top of 5 layers and that lil kid still can't get his arms to go down with that jacket on lol"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Good quality, nice fit, great price",5,"Bought this for my hubby for Christmas. I (and he did too) love the two toned style this had. The black with gray was absolutely perfect. Typically columbia jackets like this in the store I've purchased for $60+, so the price of $31 for the slightly thicker style was an excellent deal. He wears a large in basically everything (tshirts usually XL), so we ordered a large in this and it fits him perfectly with enough room to put a sweater underneath if he chooses. I've washed this about 5 times now and it still looks like the first time he wore it, so the quality is great. It's very soft, comfortable, and will keep you warm. I've been thinking about ordering one for myself (probably black or hot pink if I can find that color lol)."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Very nice,5,"Quality garment especially for the price.  Happy with my purchase.  I'm 6'0 155 lbs and the M was tight but acceptable, and the L fit a tiny bit loose but I preferred the L in the end.  Perhaps that info can help someone"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Disappointed as This Was a Return!,1,"There were no tags on the jacket, was placed in the plastic bag unzipped and unfolded, and there was a definite smell of cologne on the garment. I purchased 2 of these jackets at the same time so the Columbia Black/Grill Fleece jacket must have come from a different vendor as the second Columbia Fleece Collegiate Navy jacket was zipped, folded, and still had tags. I like the jacket so I'm going to wash it and keep it to avoid the hassle of returning it. FYI - as far as colors go, if you can't tell from the pictures, the color ""Grill"" is a more like a light, heather gray. I wanted a really loose fit with a more neutral color so I ordered a men's XL. (I wear a ladies' 16-18. I have one already and I like the loose fit.)"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Not what they used to be!,2,"Be aware that if you are purchasing a replacement for an older well-loved Columbia fleece, you will be very disappointed. Materials and attention to detail have dropped significantly in the last few years. I still have the charcoal gray one I purchased 5 years ago. The materials, logo embroidery, and fit & finish are all superior to my new one, even after innumerable washings and abuse. Looks like another brand I used to love is lowering quality to improve profitability."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Soft and comfy, perfect fleece jacket!",5,"I’m a female, 5’7” usually wear a size small in women’s clothing. I purchased this jacket in men’s because I wanted some extra length and room, I do wish it came in a men’s XS because that would have been perfect but the small fits as expected! Unbelievably soft and cozy, it’ll be amazing for lounging around or to wear outdoors in the spring/fall, and can easily be paired with another jacket for extra warmth if needed. I will say I’m a little annoyed that the label is a darker gray color, in the photo it was the same light gray as the jacket and didn’t stand out as much, but oh well! Overall I love it and would recommend it to anyone!!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Awesome Jacket,5,"I live in Wisconsin. We set a record today for coldest in November in many, many years. This jacket arrived yesterday and holy moly am I glad it did. I layered this bad boy with my outer jacket and I’m toasty warm. It’s stylish so I have one of my button down plaid shirts underneath—great for business casual. Overall, it’s been awesome and at the price cut of $60 down to $35 it’s a downright steal. Buy it!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Wrist seam came out a couple of months after purchase,3,"I purchased this red and black Columbia fleece jacket for my 18-year-old son per his request.  He likes it, although has since commented he wish he had selected a jacket with a hood.  Columbia is a bit pricey, but we ordered the jacket on Prime Day, getting a good deal.  We debated on the size, with my son wearing either medium or large these days.  We first ordered the large, but ended up exchanging it for the medium.  The jacket is not very warm, but it’s good for a fall/spring jacket when it isn’t too cold out.  One of the wrist seams came out within a couple of months after buying.  Luckily, it was an easy mend with my sewing machine.  However, I expect better from Columbia."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Perfect for cool weather when a hood isn't necessary.,5,"I have worn this jacket through three seasons now (spring 2014, fall 2014, spring 2015) and absolutely love it. When it's too cool or too warm for this jacket, I'm disappointed because I love wearing it so much! It's comfortable, looks good, fits as expected, is not wearing out quickly, easy to wash, and drys pretty fast when it gets wet.I use it whenever the weather is right and I can be in ""casual"" wear. I also wear it over my jersey/shirt while biking. The two pockets are zippered so I can be pretty active and anything I put in those pockets is going to stay there. The collar looks good but doesn't feel heavy against my neck; sometimes when the weather is a little cooler but I don't want to use a scarf, I turn the collar up with the zipper pulled up all the way and it feels lovely and keeps me a bit warmer.Two small issues, neither of which was worth removing a star from the overall rating:1- When the jacket first arrived, it was ""shedding"" some material. This made a mess of the back of the seat of my recumbent bike. As soon as I noticed this, I ran the jacket through a wash cycle and the problem disappeared. I would recommend giving this jacket a cold rinse and cool tumble-dry in your washing machine and dryer before wearing it for the first time.2- Although the outside of the jacket feels smooth and soft, the inside of the pockets does not feel that way. To my bare hands, it feels rough and not terribly comfortable. If you're looking for a jacket which will allow you to keep your bare hands in the pockets for warmth, well, you can do it, but you might not enjoy it. I usually have thin cycling gloves on in any weather during which I would use this jacket so this doesn't bother me much but there it is.I strongly recommend this jacket, especially at the price here on Amazon."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Looks faded, too tight around the bottom edge",1,"I own a previous version and it was very dark pitch black, which I loved, even after a 1000 washings. Also, the bottom was elastic and comfortable.  By contrast, this new version was too tight around the bottom, with no give and no elastic.  Most unfortunately, the ""black"" looked almost like a dark charcoal gray.  It looked like black that had been faded -- and that was upon arrival!  Definitely not the nice dark true black of previous years."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Love this sweater!,5,"I ordered a men’s fleece in large, I’m a female 5’8 and 175lbs and it fit perfectly wasn’t to tight it too baggy. It’s soft, warm, and comfy. I never liked the woman’s fleece Columbia sweaters they are too thin, the fleece on the males fleece are thicker and better quality and I’m very satisfied with my purchase. It arrived on time. The color said black, but it looks a little lighter then that. Still love it though. Awesome, just wish they had more fleece in different colors!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Short for a tall size,2,"I am glad I ordered a tall, the regular would be a half shirt on me. The width seems true to size. I am almost 6'3"" 340lbs and normally wear a 4xlt or regular 5xl. All the shirts I have that are 4xlt are longer than this 4xlt coat by a couple inches. I have a feeling after the first wash it will have to be donated because if it shrinks it will be to short for me. I would return it and go up a size but don't have the time and took the tag off and worn it already. If you are tall and want something that will cover your butt maybe try one size up from usual or go somewhere else. If it were 2-3 inches longer it would have been a 5 star coat. On a positive note it does look and feel nice."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Perfect,5,"Perfect! At 6'7"" 370 I struggle to find perfect fitting clothes but this fleece is perfect fitting in a 3xlt. I run just between 3xlt and 4xlt usually and this fits just right. Not baggy or to tight and length is perfect. It's warm but breathable so I have one for town and one I wear hiking and backpacking. I pair with my rain jacket or heavier coat on days under 30 or 20f while hiking so it works great as a insulation layer as well in winter. P.S. Columbia! If only they added a removable hood. Maybe I'm odd but I like a hood on my insulation layer not my coat so as I get warm I don't loose my hood removing my top layer."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Columbia Quality,5,"Just like all the other Columbia items I've bought throughout the years, it's the quality I've come to expect. The color, fit and finish are all on par. Those complaining about receiving so called counterfeit items, take this into consideration. Amazon can't keep up with product pictures 24/7 when a company updates its products. I saw the exact same jacket I just bought on here at a brick and mortar store for nearly triple the price Amazon is selling it for. Same tags, same label on the chest, everything was identical. Columbia has my business for life when it comes to jackets and coats. They're quality products and last for years."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Item not as pictured,1,Fleece I received does not match the image shown. Authentic Colombia has an embossed logo not a sown on patch. Not satisfied.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Too tight on sleeves!,3,"I got a 4XL and everything fits fine except for the sleeves. The cuffs on the sleeves are so tight they actually cut off the circulation to my hands! Unfortunately I cannot wear this jacket for long periods of time because it actually causes me pain. I would have returned the jacket if I figured out that faster. When wearing for short periods of time it feels fine. I still get some light use out of this when needing to leave the house for short periods of time and to run quick errands. But unfortunately I cannot get everyday usage out of this jacket like I wanted to. Maybe I can this get altered at a tailor to loosen up the sleeves or something, I don't know."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Static electricity generator,3,"Jacket looks great and fits well. Hard to find a jacket/sweater that zips in front but no hoodie / nice enough to wear to a meeting / walking around campus at work.  Only downside is the material chosen: It's been dry and wet, but no matter the weather I seem to get a static charge every time I put this on or take it off. Makes your hair rise kind of static. I'm still wearing this because I like the look and fit, but taking it off makes me feel like I've been rubbing a balloon on the cat. I'm hoping that will get better after a little wear and a few washings."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Exceeds expectations!,5,"I am a plus size woman, ordered 4XL Tall because I couldn't find anything that fit how I needed in a women's size. With being plus size, I needed it to cover my belly and backside, be long and fit me with some room to move. This jacket exceeded all expectations! I already have one Columbia jacket from years ago and it was getting too short for me for my liking. I will highly recommend this to anyone in my situation that needs a long jacket because women's jackets are cropped these days."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Great fit, perfect length, YKK zipper, quality fleece jacket...",5,"Lots of fleece jackets out there, but the Columbia Steens Mountain is my go-to.  They hold up well, they wash well, they use quality materials and YKK zippers, and they simply work when it comes to providing warmth along with softness and comfort.  I especially like the elastic cuffs which keep the cuffs in place and prevents the sleeve from extending over my hands.  Highly recommended.  (By the way, the TUSK color is like a tannish-beige.)"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Warm and comfortable, great price and fast shipping",5,"I ordered this Columbia Steens Mountain Full Zip Fleece to replace a jacket from LL Bean.  This full zip fleece is very warm and features a pocket on the inside.  That was a ""must have"" on my shopping list.  Carefully read Columbia's measuring instructions.  I am 5 foot 6 inches, 175lb., I ordered the LARGE size and it fits perfectly.  I have not have any problems with the zipper, but I've only had the fleece for a few days.  My only complaint, and this is a real ""nit pick"", is that this jacket is not water resistant or water proof.  But, I got it for over 50% off the original Columbia MSRP!  Overall I am very satisfied with this product."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,I have a Columbia fleece jacket that I really liked but it was getting a little worn,2,"I have a Columbia fleece jacket that I really liked but it was getting a little worn.  This looked like the same as what I had and ordered an XL, the same size as the one as I was wearing. This thing is labeled as an XL, but it is definitely larger than my other one.  Plus, the material is not as dense.  My other one was a lot more wind proof than this thing. Definitely need to wear a long sleeve shirt under this when out in the cooler breezes.  Either this is a totally different model, or the material is cheaper.  I will be looking for a replacement."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Thinner fleece, but decent quality",2,"The overall quality for Columbia fleece jackets has declined over the years. Thinner material, a stitched on Columbia label (all of my previous purchases of the same jacket have had a nice monogram label and logo on them), and cheaper plastic zippers with a cheap string pull have disappointed me. I now expect them to last only a couple of years due to the poorer quality of manufacture. On the plus side, however, the color schemes are nice, and there is quite a bit of variety.Overall, I'm neutral to negative about the purchase."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Soft but not durable!,1,"The jacket is very soft, warm, and fuzzy, but after wearing it for a few months, the left sleeve fell apart. Right where the wrist is, the stitching just fell out and the folded-over material kind of just disassembled itself. For a brand name item like this, I would've expected it to last several years, not a few months. Unfortunately this happened right after my return period expired, so I'll be shopping around for other brands to replace it.Fuzzy/soft/warm but cheap/not durable."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Not Wind Proof and needs a Hood,4,"I bought this jacket as a gift for a long armed and and long waisted man who is six foot tall. It fits great.These are not wind proof however, but are great for cold weather if you layer them under a wind or water proof shell or light coat.  A vest can be worn over or under them, too depending on fit. They do collect hair, whether it's horse hair, dog hair or people hair, and also will collect static electricity.  SHOCKING!  I use them exclusively on my ranch during the winter. The only thing that would make them even better would be a hood!They are great for casual wear."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Great!,5,Okay so I sized up like some of the comments said. I’m usually a 3xl but I went with the 4xl. It might actually be too big. I’m not a super tall guy I’m 5’7 but the length was perfect for what I like! Honestly I say go with your size. 🤷🏽‍♂️ If you are a tight 3xl I would size up but if it’s you comfort size then stay where you are. I hope that helps!
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Nice product,5,"I purchased this Columbia fleece to replace one I had previously (that one's zipper finally gave out).  I was hoping for an exact match and although it wasn't exactly the same material it's pretty close and I'm very satisfied. Good quality in my opinion. Keeps me warm anyway.  The previous fleece's Columbia logo was embossed directly into the material whereas this one has a sewn on label instead.  Probably eliminated some problems but I did like it the other way better. No biggie though. Same quality, same fit. Nice product for the price."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Sizes may be mislabeled,3,"So I ordered a 2XL Tall in black because I ordered a 2XLTall in charcoal last month and it fit as expected.  I tried on the sizes at a local store then just bought the tall version here.This is a good product and I've always liked these, however these do shed fluff right out of the box so be careful if you wear it over another shirt initially, it will most likely coat that shirt with fluff.  Which isn't the end of the world, but when you're at work and you wore a light blue button up, taking off the flees only to find fluff ALL over you end up stuck wearing this all day.. Which can get hot.. Which is irritating.  But whatever a couple of washes ad it should be good.Back to the sizing issue.  I found that the black was made in Haiti and the charcoal in Sri Lanka.  There may be a communication issue between manufacturing locations that caused the disparity.  The charcoal fit as expected, however the black was small.  I placed them both next to each other to compare.  It looks like the length of the arms and height of the fleece are very comparable between the two, however the width is noticeably different.  I would say the black was a XL Tall not a 2XL Tall.Initially I thought about returning it but the 2XL is slightly large on me and the XL is slightly small.  A little needed weight loss and the XL will work.Unfortunately due to the sizing issues or mislabeling, purchasing these may take a certain amount of trial and error."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Soft, warm, comfortable",5,"For the price, this is a great jacket. Very comfortable and warm and cuddly. It was a little big on me because I usually order slim fit clothes (size small) but I can very comfortably wear this over my work clothes because my work building is always cold. It looked when I first received the product that there was some pilling going on and it looked like cheap quality but that went away after the first wash and I have had no problems since. This is a thicker material, unlike a lot of thinner fleeces I have seen recently - it wears like a blanket and I consider that a good thing because it's comfy, however it won't pack down well if you want to wear it under another jacket or coat."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,The reviews say the black jacket is grey and silky but mine is not.,3,"I'm a bit disappointed with this jacket, I got a men's medium, I wear a large in women's- it fits perfectly. The thing i'm upset about is this jacket is not nearly as silky and soft as pictured or shown in reviews. I wanted a dark grey and ordered the black because reviews said the black was more grey. Although my jacket is not completely black, it is not as soft and grey as I was 'promised'. Overall this jacket is great quality and i'd recommend to anyone wanting a semi soft and warm jacket. Don't buy the black jacket if you want grey though, don't trust the other reviews."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Disappointed if this is genuine Columbia.,1,"Maybe I didn’t  understand what I was ordering and I was hesitant because of unhappy reviews but the Black Friday deal was too good to pass up. At first glance through the plastic packaging, I knew this was being returned.  This is a sub-par product for Columbia especially if full price. The loft is embarrassingly thin and i describe it as a furry felt.  Additionally, the brand name is no longer embroidered despite product photos showing that."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Classic fleece full-zip jacket,5,"My husband loves this jacket and now has four of them in different colors; this one I ordered up a size and it is a bit too. large, but he put it on and wore it, so we will keep it. He likes this Columbia jacket because it is regular fleece, not microfleece or hi-tech fabric, is regular cut,  and is full-zip, not 1/4 zip.  Very classic and he likes the pockets. This jacket could probably be worn by both men and women. They wash well and still look great after constant use. It blocks cold wind but is lightweight."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Among the best sellers for a reason...,5,"Nothing fancy, just a fine, everyday jacket. Very comfortable with sufficient warmth. I'd say in the 200 weight class. Not insulated. Not lined in any way. I've got other jackets with those features. It does what it's supposed to do. An additional layer of warmth for cool spring/fall days. Last one I had lasted over ten years of heavy use until the zipper finally broke. Not bad for a $30ish dollar jacket. Great fit and very comfortable. Highly recommended."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Low quality, I think this is a fake, and runs huge!",2,"This is not a quality item.Here are the problems,1. The quality is not comparable to other Columbia fleeces I own. This almost feels like cheap carpeting, is this even real Columbia??? I think this is fake.2. The sizing runs huge. I wear a 36R in suits, and as such typically buy my shirts in size small. This fits almost like size large. For reference I am 5 foot 11, 140 pounds.3. It is a very unattractive garment. No joke, although this is a brand new jacket it seems almost as if this is old and somebody wore it prior to me? Again very low quality, not what I expect from ColumbiaIf I were you I would just make a trip to a local marshall's or similar store if you want to find a comparable deal on a fleece. Or even go to a store at the mall. This was was a mistake to buy this, very disappointed."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Always try on clothes before cutting off tags.,1,I like the warmth and fit XLT but the craftsmanship/quality control is lacking. When it came I cut off all the tags not considering that there could be something wrong. I’ve owned the same Columbia winter jacket for over 15 years and it continues to hold up. The seam that covers the elastic on the left wrist isn’t there. I’m hoping Columbia reads this and makes it right. If they do my faith in Columbia products will be restored.  I will most definitely update my review but till then 1 star.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Don't waste your money,1,"First let me say I'm a big Columbia fan.  They usually have good quality for a good price.  That being said these fleece are crap!I question weather they are actually Columbia or not.  The fleece is very thin, and the stitching and thread used is very low quality.  The stitched seam across the back of the shoulder blades breaks every time you try to put on the fleece, because the material is so thin and stretchy.  Already coming apart after just wearing it twice.I had bought a columbia shirt from Amazon as well, which was the same size, material, and name as one I'd just purchased in the store.  It didn't fit anything like the Columbia store shirt, and the material was not nearly as good a quality.  I think amazon is selling cheap Chinese knockoffs  of brand name products.  BUY AT THE STORE!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Great quality fleece jacket.,5,"These are good quality fleece jackets, especially great for chilly weather. I’ve owned these things for years and believe me, they run a size up. I’m a medium in just about everything, but I buy these in size small. Trust me on that. Unless you like an overly baggy fit, go a size down."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Great jacket for years!!,5,I’ve been wearing these jackets for almost ten years and they’ve been great. I’ve worn these when making quick trips between buildings in freezing cold for meetings and then when I feel a bit chilly at the office. I’m buying one because someone decided to steal my jacket I had for 3 years when I had it hanging up at the office (guess they needed it worse than I did). This jacket is also fancy enough for business affairs as well.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,great fleece jacket as midlayer under skiing shell jacket,5,I plan to use this jacket as a midlayer for skiing.  I'll be wearing a shell over it.  The fleece is warm and comfortable and the neck is high and tight enough to block cold air and wind.  I've worn this jacket as a single layer in 40 degree weather and found it to be not warm enough.  It's probably adequate for 50 degree weather.  Under my ski shell and a couple of layers of long underwear I am comfortable in 20 degree weather.  I really like this jacket.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,I've worn Steens fleeces for years and highly recommend them,5,"I like a fleece that is a bit loose so I order an XL.  If you want a slightly tighter fit, go with a LT or Large Tall. The nice thing about Columbia Sportswear is their sizes have been consistent over the years. Same with the quality.  I have different colors for different activities, such as walking (collegiate blue), safety ops (sienna), regular (black), and special ops (ninja damask)."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Fits great, excellent quality!",5,"I had done quite a bit of research on a fleece jacket for the winter, and the Columbia name combined with the price made this an excellent buy.I originally ordered this product a few weeks ago and had to return it due to a slight issue with the Columbia logo -- the logo concern did not quash my desire to get this jacket, infact, it was because I had a chance to feel the jacket that I was certain I wanted one -- it looked top-notch and felt very warm!Everything was handled excellently! I received the jacket and it has kept me incredibly warm throughout the winter so far. Another story of how sellers on Amazon are really motivated to earn your business (I found this same jacket inside a local store priced at $99.99) -- so, I plan on ordering another before the season lets up as a gift for another. I don't anticipate I'll need another one next year, I can't see how this one in particular would fail on me!The fit is as expected. I typically order much larger due to my size anyhow, so it's hard for me to say that it is anything but expected! I definitely wouldn't call it ""too small"" or ""too large"" based on other similarly sized items I own and considering how much it can very, so plus-sized users should definitely consider this one!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Warm But Problematical,3,"This is a well made product, and its warmer than others I've had.  BUT it really doesn't permit you to layer for the outdoors.  Any kind of knit or broadcloth long-sleeved shirt catches on the interior surface of the fleece sleeves.  It's virtually impossible to get the shirt sleeves down to your wrists when wearing this fleece jacket.  If it was intended to be worn only with a T-shirt underneath, the product description should have said so.  Disappointing."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Black Isn't TRUE Black.,4,"Seems like a great jacket for hiking/outdoors. I'm going on a trip to Scotland/Iceland next week, and needed something to keep me warm. I've lived in Ontario for 5 years in the past, and based on my experiences with subzero temperatures I feel like this jacket alone, with merely a leather jacket on top, might be enough for truly icey conditions - which is incredible considering how light and breathable the material feels like.Be advised, though - ordered the black colour, and after confirming the SKU I got was the correct one I have to say the black isn't true black at all. It's more of a charcoal colour. Wore it under a graphite grey looking pea coat and the colours are so close to each other it makes it look like the jacket's neck is a part of the pea coat.Apart from that, feels really comfortable, and I'm sure this will be great outdoor wear in most conditions!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Bought Two of These...Odd sizing...Very nice and warm!!!,5,"So I bought two of these fleece sweaters and both are made well and very warm. Style is comfortable and overall as expected. My only dilema is this. In black this fleece fits a bit snug, but pretty close to the average size large. The tag says large and what not. However I also bought the same fleece in Red and this one fits a bit larger almost like it were an extra large, but not quite as big. Still bigger and more roomy than the black. Again, both say large and all the tags seem correct. As for me, I'm pretty much small enough to wear a large, but also big enough to wear an extra large without it looking too huge. So, what am I to do? Do I keep both knowing one is a big more snug while the other is a bit more roomy? Who knows, but if you were to buy two of these that would be the only way to compare the different feels on these two fleece sweaters that are supposed to be identical in every way except the color. I'm keeping both because they are very comfortable, but again my dilema being the odd sizing between the two colors. I'm tempted to e mail columbia on the issue, but not sure what they will say. I may anyway and if so I will update this review later. Enjoy and keep warm...these fleece sweaters will serve you well.UPDATE: So I returned the smaller size of the black fleece and ordered an extra large one. I got one labeled ""L"" and fits like the red one which fit more like an extra large fleece. Basically in a nut shell, I'M DONE WITH COLUMBIA. Sizes and quality control cannot be trusted. The sweaters are nice in terms of the fabric, but everyone is making fleeces now. You can get a normally sized fleece at W@lmart and it would probably be more true to the labeled size than gambling on Columbia sizes. Between returning the products, shipping labels, inconvenience, I probably broke even or so had I just bought this retail and picked the size that fit me in person. If you want to gamble on what size you're actually going to get compared to the labeled product and what you actually ordered then by all means keep buying Columbia and figure it out on your own. I'd rate these fleeces at about a 2 stars only because I like the fabric, but its not worth the hassle because Columbia doesn't have their sizes or tags in order. Were these all just one big oops and being pawned off on amazon to clean house, or does Columbia care? Well, glad you asked because I contacted them and their best solution was to order one directly from them instead etc. Really? So if I bought a HONDA from a dealership and the car is all screwed up, then does that mean I have to go to Japan to get it squared away? What's the point? Funny, I used to work for HONDA and they made sure the cars were in order. On the other hand Columbia either cares about the products they are putting their NAME ON, or they don't. From my experience....they don't. You think they are going to issue a recall for these fleeces? NOPE. It's easier to sell them anyway and have people lose money, time, and convenience sending them back and forth to AMAZON because the sizes were screwed up in a factory overseas. I'm surprised Amazon is still selling these with all of the conflicting reviews on the sizing. Sorry COLUMBIA, I own 3 products from you....you're OUT!! No more."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Fit & style fine; pocket fell apart,1,"This sweatshirt fit as expected and is just the warmth I wanted. But the seam under one of the pockets unravelled shortly after the return date expired, with the result that the pocket is really just an open space at the bottom. Luckily I discovered this before losing my wallet or phone by putting it in the pocket. That's why the single star rating. Otherwise would have been five stars."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Fuzzy and warm,5,"I was looking for a new Columbia turtleneck to wear during the fall, and this is great! It has 4 pockets over all, two on the outside with zippers, two on the inside, no securing features. It has a one-sided drawstring around the waist which is great for women if you prefer a loose fit like I do but don't wait it hanging past your thighs. I have a 40 in chest and the L is enough room for layers, although I think the XL may be less clingy on the arms. There is no lining that makes it easy for sleeves to slide in, but it's fuzzy everywhere so you will feel very warm and cozy - it's a good trade off. The turtleneck is high enough to keep your neck and lower jaw warm, too."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,My second one.,5,This is my second one to own. My first one I had for about 4 years with no trouble. Lost a bunch of weight and needed a smaller size. Love this jacket.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Very Comfortable,5,"I don't usually buy clothing online since I usually need to make sure things will fit properly due to the fact that I spend my days in a wheelchair. This jacket is a great addition for me and is perfect for the fall temperatures. It keeps my back covered so it's plenty long and it fits my shoulders perfectly. I also have very long arms and the sleeves stay down around my wrists even when reaching for something. There seems to be plenty of room so that when the weather gets colder I can layer it with other sweaters and heavier shirts. I was out in some rain with it and it didn't soak it up at all and even having gotten wet the color did not run, bleed or fade.Columbia didn't skimp on quality with this fleece jacket. There were no messed up seams, the zippers seem to be made of a better quality material and they don't catch the material that the jacket is made of. The selection of colors was quite surprising and that is one reason I decided to try this coat.One of the biggest pluses is the value. Columbia normally isn't what you'd call inexpensive but I did get a very good deal on an excellent product and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one before this particular style is no longer made. How they (Amazon) can sell it at 50% off is beyond me but hey it's extra in my pocket."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"NOT A TRUE BLACK. Can't tell if its navy, has a dark blue tinge.",1,"This is a new purchase. I have ordered these in the past. I give it one star to call attention to the color black. It is not the same black as on the model, not the same thick lustrous looking fleece, even. The model is wearing a true black. The 2 XXL jackets I received were a very dark navy/maybe...black. I had to go around to family members and ask if it was black or blue and no one could be sure, even when holding it up to black! It's not as light as the collegiate navy they offer, either. This was very disappointing because I had also ordered 2 Navy colored fleece from the Amazon essential line and wanted to get two black from this Colombia line and give them as gifts to my 2 sons so each would have a black and blue fleece for Christmas. I also wanted them to compare the two brands. What a hassle! It's getting too close to Christmas for this nonsense! QUALITY CONTROL PEOPLE!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,THE WARM JACKET YOU WANT IS HERE !!,5,"This jacket is so comfortable,and,take my word for it,it will DEFINATELY keep you warm. On me,it's not too light,nor too heavy. Other reviewers wrote that they thought that the sleeves had a tendency to run a bit too long. I would have to respectfully disagree. The jacket almost fits like it was made for me. I know it wasn't,but,it kind of feels like it was. If you're anything like me,could maybe get a chill when the temperature drops below 50,you will be exceptionally glad that you made this purchase. Could I possibly end up wearing this jacket 10 or 11 months out of the year? Perhaps. Sad that I own it? No. I didn't just buy a jacket. What I really purchased was the knowledge that as long as I wear it; I will not feel a chill and that's more than good enough for me."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,fuzzy sweater and I love wearing it,5,"I purchased this for myself. I am a 5'11 mom of five who weighs 195. I found myself constantly wearing my husbands and decided to get one for myself. I got the XL tall and it's a little big but that's how I wanted it. I had recently bought the Large tall in black but it was too tight around my hips. This is a soft, fuzzy sweater and I love wearing it. I love the zippered pockets as well, great for putting my phone inside while I'm running around with the kids. All in all, I love this and I'll be buying it again when this one gets too worn."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Tall Jacket,5,This jacket is perfect.  I am 6-6 and the fit is exactly what I want.  I highly recommend it to my fellow tall people.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Great everyday fleece,5,I love this fleece. It was a replacement for the identical fleece purchased 7 years ago that the zipper broke on. It’s just plain and simple a nice fleece. Washes and wears great and you can’t complain about the price. I have one of each color and wear them year round. Perfect for winter when I’m in and out of the car into customers homes. No bothering with a winter coat on and off.  Nice pockets. Great everyday fleece.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Comfortable lightweight fleece,4,"The fleece is warm and comfortable. The material is not very premium though. The zipper is flimsy. Also I usually wear M. I'm 5ft 9 inch and am very slim with wide shoulders. I had to downsize on this item. The S runs more like an M. The price is good, but you get what you pay for. Don't expect this to be a garment to be up to the same standard as The North Face or Patagonia. It's not bad though, just not gonna blow your mind either."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,A little snug,4,"This is a nice jacket, well constructed and warm.  I had previously ordered another Steens Mountain jacket in XXL size by accident, when I intended to order in XL. It was loose, but I didn't mind, and so kept it. When I wanted to order a second of the same style in a different color pattern, I made sure I ordered XL. This one fits, but is a bit snug, more like I would expect if I had ordered a L size. I don't know if the difference in sizing is because of the styling or of the country of origin. The XXL was made in Bangladesh, the XL in Sri Lanka.Just be aware that the sizing seems to be inconsistent. You may have to try a couple of different sizes to find the fit you like."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Hubby LOVES these fleece jackets,5,"This is the sixth of these Columbia jackets I have bought for my husband. They rarely have the green and today it was in stock and a great price! These jackets are warm without bulk and wash well (cold, hang to dry) and last a long time. The zip pockets keep belongings secure and the drawstring at the bottom can be cinched to keep out the cold air. My hubby typically wears a 2x in shirts and the xxl in this jacket fits nicely. Highly recommend!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"If you're looking for a snug or athletic fit, order a size smaller than normal.",5,"Likes: Zippers all run freely and smoothly. The added length to mid hip helps keep out drafts along with shock cord pulls at the bottom of the garment. The slightly loose fit allows for layering underneath this fleece top.Dislikes: Depending on the color and size you want, there is a very wild swing in price.Note: This is the 3rd one of these that I've purchased. The first  one I bought 3 years ago, and the second one I bought 2 years ago. They get worn every day 6 months of the year and are still going strong, with very minor pilling on the one I've had for 3 years. A very solid product."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Very nice jacket but sizing is way off.,4,"Funny story, I got a $30 Columbia gift card as a early Xmas present and my old jacket was ready to hit the trash. I ordered one from Columbia in one color and the other from Amazon in a different color. I did it like that because I knew the one from Amazon would get here really fast and as I mentioned, I needed it. The one from Amazon came in as expected but it was WAY to small. I initiated a return and Amazon did a no hassle exchange. I sent the old one back and am awaiting the new one. A couple days later I received the one direct from Columbia which I expected to have to return and it fit perfectly. I believe these are Asian sized and if you are going to order I would order two sizes up from what you actually wear.That said it was exactly as described except for size. It was a very nice jacket with plenty of secure pockets and large pockets on the inside."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Best fitting fleece on the market for tall folks.,5,"These Fleece is the most comfortable thing I have ever worn on my body.  I am extremely impressed with how soft and plush this fleece is.  I originally bought this jacket not realizing that I had ordered from Big & Tall selection, but thankfully it turns out I am extremely tall and this worked out fabulously.  finally a sleeve that is long enough to accommodate my longer then normal arms.  Finally a article of clothing that is long enough to keep my waist line covered even when bending over, or moving my arms over my head.  If you are a tall person, over 6 feet, then this is the one you want.Side note: It is hard to tell from the lighting in these images, but the Charcoal grey color appears almost black in the image, I thought I ordered black and received grey instead.  Now in person, the grey is a bit lighter of a color then is shown in the image, so keep this in mind when ordering. Either the way the Charcoal grey is a wonderful color and I am actually happier with it."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Nice Fit,5,"My son typically wears 2x but the current Columbia jacket the one he has is not long enough.  I purchased this as a Christmas gift because I noticed his jacket in the back did not stay below his waist.  I like that this jacket is long enough to stay down when he bends over.  It also is large enough that he has room when he wears long sleeve shirts under it.  I ordered a 2xlT grey and he loves it.My son is: 5'8, 240 lbs, 42 waist....2xlT jacket was good loose fit.  He could wear an XLtall but I wanted a roomier jacket."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Very comfy sweater!,5,"I love this sweater! I bought it for my boyfriend to wear in his video calls and he loves it too! It is very cozy and covers up very nicely. Not quite warm enough to wear outside in the winter, but it comes perfect for the fall and spring seasons - or just to wear around in the house! Columbia is a very good jacket brand, so I'll definitely be a lifetime buyer!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Tough & Long Lasting Nice Jacket,5,"3XLT for my 6’6” big guy who normally wears 3XLT. Fits perfectly and has a pull thing to tighten jacket bottom if you desire. This was to replace his exact same jacket, probably 12 years old and washed and dried a lot. It’s not as soft or fresh as the new one and he plans to use the old jacket for yard work, the new one for going off and work. Yay for consistent perfection in a jacket!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Poor Quality, Fit and Construction",2,"Although this jacket was ""on Sale"" the price was not worth the product.The jacket is thin and the seems accross the back are less than comfortable.I plan to put it in a ziplock bag and keep in trunk of car for emergencies only.Spend a little bit more and get a good quality product.I question if this was really a Columbia Product!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Great Fleece at a Great Price,5,Another great Columbia product.I bought this fleece jacket after buying the Steen's Mountain fleece vest. I really liked the vest and thought it worth a try to buy the jacket. Not disappointed! The Jacket fits nicely. One difference between the vest and the jacket. The jacket has a drawstring at the waist - a nice addition. I would buy this again and would recommend it to friends.Ray
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,You won't find this jacket in a Columbia store - I doubt if it's original,1,"I originally gave this jacket a higher rating until I saw the 'felt, or real' Columbia jacket in an outlet store. The material is not fleece. It's more like felt - the material used in cheap blankets that are made from recycled plastic bottles. There seems to be two items being sold here. The $29-$31 dollar jackets and the higher priced ones. It's not just the color that's different - it's the material as well."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Comfortable to wear.,5,"Very good jacket. I ordered it for casual use for rainy/dreary days.  I ordered 1 size larger  3xl , I am 265lbs., 6 ft, 5.  Even thought 2xl  would have fit.  What happened was it was so nice and comfy, I ordered another.  Now my go to jacket after work.  Or going out. Or just in case.  Alot of jackets come up short, feel cold,  or too short in sleeves.  Not this one and for the price it's a nice value."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Too big,3,"I got a men's Columbia for myself because I wanted a loose, boyfriend type feel with this because I love these jackets. Unfortunately for me, this was way way way too big (I am 5'1 and 125 pounds) even for a small and did not look cute-in-a-loose-style at all. Probably would look great on men (who it's meant for) and the quality of the jacket was nothing to complain about, it just didn't work for me. I returned this and got my refund soon after."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Great jacket,5,"I'm female and bought this jacket for myself as it seems unisex. My daughter also has one.  I get cold at work and usually have on a jacket or a vest. I purchased this jacket in black and it looks very nice with slacks and a blouse. It's a good price and a nice quality.One thing I really like about the jacket that isn't mentioned in the description, the inside of the jacket has what I call ""drop pockets"". There are deep pockets on both sides of the interior so that you have safe place to drop your cell phone or keys."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Fleece,5,"These jackets are great! I bought one for myself earlier and my husband liked it so much that he had me order one for him. They run a bit small so I ordered the next size up for both of us. They are very lightweight but at the same time offer much warmth. They won't take the place of a heavy coat but for the time in between, they are great! I would definitely buy it again."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Lightweight,4,"It doesn't have a fleece lining like my bf's... his is on the heavy side... this one is definitely more for early fall and late spring OR if you tend to be on the hot side already and only require a lighter jacket all winter. Still, a good addition to my wardrobe. I'm keeping it. It is well made. I bought a 1X mens and I normally wear an 18W women's."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Be wary of bargains on big names.,3,"The jacket itself feels great. The price for this jacket was unbelievable for it being a Columbia product. But after putting it on I realized why it was so inexpensive. The two pockets sit back pretty far, almost at the side seams of the jacket. So putting my hands in the pockets takes some reaching and it feels a bit awkward. I can feel the zipper pressing into my skin and it leaves a visible indentation. The jacket is very light yet still offers good warmth. I just don't like putting my hands in the pockets now."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,A hiking and camping staple,5,"My husband is 5'9"", 165 lb. and generally wears a Medium in tops. Ordered a medium and it fit great! Columbia's sizing guide is accurate.ProsCan be worn in a variety of weather; Helps keep in body heat when it's cold and snowy or just on a brisk day for extra warmthLong A-line cut is flatteringWashes well; Does not shrink or become itchySoft; Fleece is comfortable and not itchyConsNone, yet!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Men's large (Usually wear women's medium) - Roomy fit, just like I wanted",5,"I originally bought a different jacket in Women's large even though I usually wear women's medium, but it seemed to only be made for stick women as that one was too tight across the shoulders and too tight around the upper arms, especially if wearing anything other than sleeveless. I like my jackets to be a little roomy to easily fit layer and such. I decided after that one to purchase this one in Men's large, which has served well. It has the zippered pockets, which is useful; it's extremely soft, and it fits in the slightly oversized way I was looking for so that I have no trouble layering things under it. The sleeves are long on me like I was hoping so that I can use the ends of the sleeves to cover my hands if I wish, but the elastic on the wrists also allows me to keep the sleeves in place, out of my way when I need it."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Soft, washes well",5,"Husband LOVES this, had to buy a second one for him. He wears these every day, all day. Soft, plush fleece. Nice long sleeves. Black is more of a very, very dark gray. Washes well. Dries fast. I close all zippers and turn inside out so it doesn't get pilly. Bought large, he's 6', 185. Would fit someone a little heavier, too, it seems."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Black is not black anymore,3,"I love these fleeces (order almost every year). I ordered a black one, it is NOT black, more of a faded black or dark gray color. I took a photo of my old black one and new one side by side, you can see a huge difference in color. Quite disappointed with this purchase."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Disappointed,4,"Although the jacket appears to be of the same quality you would find in the retail store the jacket I received was a previously customer return item, see photo with Amazons RR label.Perhaps if this was spelled out in the description I would not be as disappointed as I am but when I pay full retail price for a brand new, never used item, I expect to receive a brand new item. Especially when it comes to clothing."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Columbia ""Great"" Again",5,"This newer model of the Columbia fleece is as great as the others I own (I have a charcoal and navy blue full-zip fleece).  The Steen's Fleece is really nice and maintains the top quality fleece we have come to love. Many reviewers are right about ""Tall"" being ""Really Tall!"" All of my Columbia fleece full-zips are XLT but this one has sleeves that are 1-½"" longer and the circumference of the fleece is an extra inch+. It is the same length as the others.  I would recommend it for men 6'3"" or taller.  I am 6'4"" and it is ample in all areas.The disappointments are few. The small cords on the zipper pulls come off easily and are lost quickly. I had one fall off on the first time I wore it. Additionally, there is a waist cord-lock only on one side of the bottom edge. I prefer to have a lock on both sides, but, again, these are minor.I give this a full 5 stars for Columbia's superb quality and the elastic at the wrists which keeps the sleeves in place. I love the Columbia full-zip fleece for comfort, layering in the house, work and outdoors. You will not be disappointed!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Quality is questionable...,2,"My first impressions of this jacket were that it was lacking the quality I would expect from a Columbia product. The fleece material used did not seem to be of high quality and craftsmanship appeared a bit dodgy. Additionally, I expected more of a navy blue than the color I ultimately received, which is a softer, more aqua blue (don't use the picture I attached to judge the color, it's not nearly as dark/navy as it appears in that photo). Nevertheless, I wore the jacket regularly for about a month and was happy with it. Until, after about a month of regular use, a large hole appeared in the left pocket. I don't  do any sort of vigorous activity in the jacket and I don't carry anything in the pocket heavier than my cell phone, so there's really no reason for it to be falling apart. Now I have to be careful not to go to put my phone in that pocket out of habit or I run the risk of having it splatter all over the floor."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Fits as expected.,2,"Too bad it fits as expected because I ordered a size smaller based on reviews saying it ran big.  I could still use it, just tighter than I like.  Went to wash it for the first time and notice one of the seams under the armpit had a hole.  It wasn't ripped, just not sewn correctly.  My guess is these are getting sold as seconds or outlet type clothing.  I plan on trying to sew the hole."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Keeps me warm and comfortable!,5,"I got his jacket for $26 here on Amazon and it is worth every single penny! I am pretty sure I can't get a jacket for this price and quality anywhere locally. The only bad thing is that I chose the wrong advice from the reviews. Some said that you should buy your normal size, some have said it runs a bit big while others have said to buy a size bigger than what you'd normally get. Basically, I was back at square one! Which to choose?! I'm 5'8 at about 140lbs and I got the medium. Well, turns out the sleeves where just a bit longer and looser than what I'd like it to be. I should definitely have gotten small!Nonetheless, the jacket keeps me perfectly warm even when working inside our server data center. It does get a bit harder to put on when you are already wearing a long sleeve dress shirt but by no means is that a deal breaker. You'll eventually get use to it. The zipper handles quite nicely and the jacket looks good both zipped and unzipped."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,So good I had to buy another!,5,"So, I’m a big dude. 6,4” 280. I can never find jackets that are long enough.  This is the first jacket that had arms long enough.  If you want a big jacket that you are not swimming in pick these."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Just a bit loose,3,"Overall it is a great jacket, just not a very snug fit. Just a bit lengthier overall, but not too much. The Sleeve length is the most annoying thing. Again would have preferred a touch shorter. I have to pull up the sleeves to wash hands etc. I would say the fabric also is a bit dull looking than shown on the picture."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Great jacket..,5,Thank you for fast delivery on this item.. I did purchase it prior Christmas day but got large instead of x-large..I'm returning the other jacket and ordered this on Christmas day...Got it today the 28th...Who can argue that amazon isn't the best.....Great color and Great fit..Husband loves it....and that's all that matters...Thank you Amazon..
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Nice jacket,5,"this is a nice jacket.  My husband loves it, it fits well and keeps him warm.  He wears it every day.  He has worn out two previous jackets.  This is his third.  It has two deep pockets on the inside and the outside pockets at the side seams have zippers.  Keeps things from getting lost."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Nice, But Cheap Tag",4,"I've bought more than one.  The tag on the chest is different with certain colors.  The Olive colored style had the cheap sewn on tag on the chest.  The all Black style had the Columbia logo embroidered on the chest.  It looks nicer embroidered, IMO.  But these jackets are nice anyway.  They are more of an outer layer for me in winter.  They are not thick enough to be worn alone against the cold."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Not true to size!,2,"Looks like a nice jacket, but sizing is way off.  I wear a 3X in just about everything .  I ordered a 3x and 4x as I saw other reviews complaining about size.  I have never worn a 4x in my life!  When they arrived, I put the 4x on first and I couldn’t zip it!  It fit like a 2X.  Very disappointed."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Poor quality,3,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law. The fit of the jacket was perfect, but the quality of it was not what I expected. I did not like the material that it was made from. It was like fleece but not quite. I think it will easily attract fuzz. The value was good but overall, I was not very satisfied with the purchase."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Wear it everywhere,5,"I discovered Colombia jackets years ago and have been wearing one religiously ever since. The price & quality are great. This jacket is soft, fits loosely & is downright comfortable.I did try to wear it on a very cold day (28 degrees and windy) and instantly learned that was a mistake. This is more for fall weather or for layering."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Love this,5,"The material is better than expected. Not too thick and not too thin. It is more of a cross between a really nice sweater and a normal jacket which is exactly what I had hoped for. I am 6'3"" 200lbs with long arms and this Large Tall size is a Perfect fit all around. I usually have trouble with the fit on most items but I am extremely happy with this."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Great fleece lightweight jacket,5,"Great fleece lightweight jacket. This can be worn over a tee shirt, casual shirt (short or long sleeve).In chilly whether it has amazing thermal retention. I wouldn't advice jogging wearing this jacket, but it is fine for walking or staying warm otherwise. It does breath, and wears very comfortably."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Favorite Fleece I Own,5,"I own a few generic brand fleece jackets but this is the best. I've worn this for over 2 winter seasons now and it's held up great. There has been no need for any sewing repairs, there is no fraying or split seams, the zippers work as well as the day I got it, and after 2 winters of almost daily use it is in excellent condition. The material is soft and warm (as one would expect with fleece), the pockets are large and zippers work great and even have a small opening on the inside of the jacket to allow a spot for earbuds or headphone wires to pass through to the pocket. The only problem I ran into was it not being long enough. I don't generally need my clothing to be Tall but with this I did. For reference I'm 6'3"" and 280lbs and a Tall fit perfectly in both length in the torso and at the arms. I'm planning on being able to wear this for the next few winters as well before I need to replace it. This is something I've come to expect from the quality of Columbia."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Excellent Fleece Jacket,5,"Here in NM it's the perfect fleece jacket for all-winter wear! Wore my old one until I lost weight and needed a smaller one. Sleeves are not lined, so it's always comfy against the skin with just a T-shirt under. Old one had lots of wear left, so it was donated. Fits exactly as I hoped! Slightly larger than the same-size shirt or T-shirt so it's easy to zip and move around with. It almost looks like a really dark charcoal because of the fleece on the outside, but it is black (just not quite as black looking as a black T-shirt)."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Works for me,5,"This fleece fits oddly but it is perfect for me.  I am usually a large tall but this Columbia Steen Mountain medium fits great. I have 36” arms and the arms are long enough and the bottom is a few inches below the belly button like I like it.  I have bought 4 now, largely because the (turtleneck) collar is tight enough to keep the wind out so I can wear this garment with a jacket and keep warm or cool just by zipping/unzipping my jacket and this fleece."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Very good jacket fits perfect,4,"As a tall normal build boi (6'4,210) jacket shopping or really any clothes shopping sucks they're either crop tops or way to big but this jacket fit very nicely, sleeves actually go full length of my arm. A little longer down my waist would be nice but then again that is normal.Would recommend for price, quality and fit I had a north face like $60 one and lost it Columbia is way better and cheaper. Soft and perfect for any weather very sharp looking even in office setting"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,NICE JACKET,5,"Nice jacket keeps me warm in 50 degree f. weather. Looks nice and fits well. Two outside zippered pockets, and two deep inside pockets. If you think you might be in between sizes, buy the next size up. (I'm on the bigger size of a Medium and so I bought the Large and it fits very well.)"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Hey, it's a Columbia fleece. What more do I need to say?",5,"My old work fleece wore out so my house fleece became my work fleece so I needed a new house fleece. So of course I got a Columbia fleece because that's what I get because they are just so darned comfortable. Seriously, I'm not a paid actor, I just love these things and have been wearing them for years. Soft, cozy, warm, and reasonably priced. If you've never had one of these then you've been short changing yourself. If you wear one of these cozy things around the house you'll probably save what you just spent on it on your next heat bill."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,This is a very nice jacket and the price is right,4,"This is a very nice jacket and the price is right.  I like the color and the fit was as I expected.  I particularly like the pockets on the inside and the outside.  As mentioned by another reviewer, the inside pockets do not zip, but that is okay with me.  The main fabric is a little thinner than I expected.  I had an old Columbia fleece that was styled similar but with a heavier weight fleece.The advantage of this lighter weight fleece is that it makes for a very nice layering system and something that can be worn inside on colder days (much like a sweater).  The obvious disadvantage is that going outside in a cold wind will quickly remind you that this jacket should be used in a layered system.Overall, i am very happy with this purchase and I have worn this jacket quite frequently since it arrived.Also, I really have to compliment Amazon Prime on the ease of ordering and the fast response time.  This was a very easy purchase and I was impressed that I could get this jacket so fast.  Thanks."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Collegiate navy color is misleading.,4,"Collegiate Navy- I bought the LT version in this color. I own other Columbia fleece jackets and overall enjoy them.  For the price (~$20) they are a pretty good value.  However, I found this particular color to be misleading. In the stock photos it looks much lighter than it is in reality.  In reality it a much deeper, darker blue.  It still is a nice enough color, but certainly isn't what I was expecting. Be aware if you pick this color.  I've included a more accurate stock photo that comes from a different retailer that more accurately shows the color that Amazon's does."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Comfortable, Light Weight, Warm",5,My office is in our basement and it is chilly most of the time. I need to wear a jacket or sweatshirt while working. This fleece jacket is my choice. It is very light and comfortable. I can wear it outside while walking the dog when it is chilly and come inside and get back to work without talking this off. I have several of these in various colors and love them all!
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,It’s a Columbia jacket ... you know what you’re are going to get.,5,"Love Columbia jackets , own a number of them, good stitching, sewing and feels comfortable, got a smokin deal during Black Friday weekend, should of purchase another jacket in a different color as well. They are long lasting and easy to clean and maintain. Comfortable lining and solid zipper, never have one break on me ."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Perfect fit. Exactly what I wanted,5,"When my measurements based on the chart said I should order a small, I rechecked my measurements and the size chart. I don't think I've ever ordered a small in anything. But trusting the sizing chart and desiring my coat to fit me right (most of mine are too big), I ordered the small. My wife thought I was crazy and was sure I wouldn't be able to get it on and zipped up without it being too tight around my belly.When it arrived, I slipped it on and zipped it up. Perfect fit. Exactly what I wanted. My wife was surprised how good it looked. It is soft, warm, good pockets that can be zipped up if you want to put things in them and not worry about them falling out if you take it off or get overly active. I'm very happy with this purchase. Measure yourself and trust the chart even if it seems to suggest a size you usually don't order. Worked well for me."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Authentic Columbia Product? Probably Not; Warm and Attractive? Definitely,4,"The suspiciously low price probably means these probably aren't real ""Columbia"" fleece sweaters, but I couldn't resist buying one for myself at such a low price. I've had this brand of fleece sweater before, and this was definitely a different level of quality. It's much scratchier, but the fleece is comfortably soft, warm, and thick. And I love the contrasting zipper on some models. If the price stays this low, I'll buy more for gifts."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Comfy sweater,4,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   I purchased this as a gift for someone. I had to get a replacement because the first one had the plastic covering melted to it somehow. The new one came fine and the person I purchased it for said that it fit great and is very comfy."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,My favorite jacket for spring and autumn,5,"Columbia is great at making lightweight jackets that are actually effective at keeping you warm. This fleece jacket is perfect for autumn and spring weather, and it is better than expected for blocking wind chill. The zipper seems durable so far, and I haven't experienced any fraying or uprooted stitching (and I've washed it several times so far).The jacket itself is stylish and attractive. I ordered the Charcoal Heather colour which goes great with pretty much any shirt worn underneath or any pants.As far as size - I typically wear medium in most brands so that's what I ordered. It fits nicely (note: it is not a fitted or slim fit) around the waist and torso. The only complaint in this regard is the sleeve length. It seems just a tad bit longer than most medium sized jackets/shirts. It is not so long though to warrant sizing down. Other reviewers have noted to order a size down. This is true if you like a snug/slim fit. I personally don't mind the ""looser"" (but not baggy) fit."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,REALLY snug sleeves.....unwearable,2,"The sleeves are SUPER SUPER SMALL and TIGHT.  When buying a XXL I would expect way more room.  Just wearing a t-shirt I could barely get the sleeves on.  It was cheap enough just giving it away to veterans instead of hassle to return it.  Horrible fit though.  Very disappointed.  Anyone with a very muscular build would never get an arm in this coat.  I am 5'11"" and 230lbs and there was just no way.  It was like it was painted on.  And there was no give at all.  It was super skin tight."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Love This Jacket,5,I bought one of these several years ago.  It's taken lots of abuse over the years.  Converted it to a hunting layer this year and bought a new one.  Same exact quality and comfort as the one I bought about 10 years ago.  I'm just hoping I can find the same jacket again in 10 more years.  You can't go wrong with this jacket!!!
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Great, thin fleece for the price",5,"At $25 this was an amazing deal.  Not as high-quality fleece as my wife's Patagonia but a very solid, well-fitting jacket.  Very soft, but also nice and thin, so it fits perfectly as a layer under a winter coat.  Also great as a standalone jacket now that it's in the low 50s.  Very pleased with this purchase."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Good,4,"Not sure if fleece is still graded in 100/200/300, Polartec scale. Or Patagonia's R1/R4, with the 1's being the lightest weight, but I'm not sure if this jacket even qualifies for a 1 rating. It's the first fleece I've owned that was see-through, so I know there's not much water resistance going on here.That being said, I've been out hiking with this jacket and just a dri-fit t-shirt and was quite comfortable. It was lower 40's/4.4c no wind. Have not tried layering over it yet, but under I have used that t and a dri-fit thermal, and had the jacket off within 15 minutes, it was hot. Of course YMMV.I'm 6' 160, the medium size fit okay, even layered. Price just seems a little steep for such lightweight, but I'm keeping it. 4 out of 5 stars. Happy hiking."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Nice cool weather jacket,5,"Very comfortable and good looking. This jacket is great if you need a bit of warmth in cool weather. I can wear it comfortably into the 30's unless there is a cutting wind. I also wear it as a light rain jacket, but not if it is raining hard or if I am going to be exposed to precipitation for more than a few minutes."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Excellent Fleece Option,4,This is an excellent buy and a fine product.  I don't usually buy fleece with style in mind but this is probably one of the most stylish pieces of fleece I've ever owned.  The fit is good and exactly as described.  Anything you buy from Columbia is no worse than a solid product--this is not a low-end fleece item (it's well made) and the price is a bargain.  It's got enough give in the right places so it's appropriate for outdoor athletic activity (say…layered over some polypropylene if you were going cross-country skying and under a rain jacket if you were doing field trials).  It also works for indoor wear as a sweater replacement and is smart enough to even get away with wearing in a business environment if it's a very casual one.  The fleece level is light enough that I wouldn't want to wear it in a stiff wind (but then that's true of almost all fleece--without a liner it's not going to keep out the wind).  You will find cheaper fleece versions around but they won't be as stylish and as well made as this one.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Accidentally found a Christmas treasure.,5,This was accidentally delivered to me. Since the name actually started with the first letters as my name I accidentally opened it. I have since ordered three as Christmas gifts lol.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Perfect fit!  No loose stitching either!,5,"I read the reviews where people were complaining about the stitching.  From the two I bought, the stitching is perfect!  Must be more people loving to complain about non-existent things!  The fabric is polar fleece, a little thicker than the normal fleece, but still breathable.  The fit is perfect!  I've washed it a couple of times and it has NOT fallen apart like the other reviewers.  Order one, see for yourself!  Finally a tall size that actually is cut the way it should be!  great jacket!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Super comfortable,5,This Fleece Jacket by Columbia is my second and the first has lasted for years. It is my favorite for layering. What I like most is the huge pockets and this new jacket has those with an added bonus of inside pockets the same size as the main ones. The outer ones are zippered but the inside ones are open. They are perfect for slipping in my tablet or e-reader but could hold much more. You just need to be careful when you take it off because these inner pockets are open at the top. That works well for my tablet though. Another point is that on my old one it was the inner pocket that wore first and this extra pocket promises a longer life since there is an extra layer there. As far as size it fit as expected but is also quite stretchy with an elastic cord you can adjust on the bottom which adds to the comfort and the flexibility. Like most fleece it's quite warm but not a great choice in biting wind. Layering with a wind breaker makes it a versatile combination.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Excellent jacket, no complaints.",5,"Great looking, lightweight, warm, and comfortable. What more can you ask from a fleece jacket? The color schemes are fashionable and many people will complement it. It has nice fleece lined belly pockets for when you forget your gloves. You’ll get exactly what you expect. The Fit is pretty much spot on, as you can see in the photo. I’m 6’ and 200 lbs, the large fits exactly right."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Disclaimer: this is about the one jacket that I ...,3,"Disclaimer: this is about the one jacket that I home. It is probably not a blanket statement about all of the jackets.I purchased this and started wearing it mid-November. It is now January and I have noticed that the left pocket has a hole in it.  To add insult to injury, I realized it had a hole in the pocket when I discovered that I had lost flash drive with an important document on it. It is inconvenient and frustrating not being able to use that pocket."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,I like it and it fits as expected everywhere except for ...,3,"I like it and it fits as expected everywhere except for around the bottom.  It is so tight around the bottom that it just doesn't match the fit of the rest of the jacket.  I even cut out the draw strings that you can tighten the bottom with but it's still tight.  It's almost so tight that it looks funny on me.  Please note that I'm a 5'3 female weighing 140 pounds so I'm not big by any means. I ordered a mens jacket because I wanted a loose baggier fit than you get in a women's size.  Also, I ordered the black but it's definitely a dark charcoal gray color. Which is fine with me but not what I expected."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Good Fleece, but terrible delivery protocols",4,"The Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Fleece is fine, fits as expected, and seems to be of quality. However, the delivery person should ring the doorbell before just leaving on the front door. Would take literally 2 seconds. Yes, I said that it could be left at the front door if no one was at home. The ring would have announced it at the door since I was home. Package could have been stolen if left and I was actually home. Sloppy work."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Authentic brand,5,Very nice for the price and it is authentic Columbia brand. It fits very well and is of high quality. I ordered black in color and it it more of a charcoal grey but not a problem. For the price as compared to another leading brand you can't go wrong buying this.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Not as good as before,3,"The quality level doesn’t live up to the previous years version.  The material feels thinner, cheaper, and weaker.  The strap used to hang the jacket by its collar broke in the 1st week I used it.  I just went back to using my older Columbia, even tho it’s a little big."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Very comfy""",5,"My daughter bought me a red one a few year's ago.  I'm 85, and stay home a lot, so I wear it all day, and also to bed, as a pajama top.  Thought I'd get a black one, to have a spare.  Not the warmest jacket there is, but it's nice to wear sitting around watching TV"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Bad fitting and cheap feeling material,2,I had high expectations for this jacket but it all fell flat after I touched it. The fleece material feels bad and the fit is so bad. It might be a great option for people with belly but it is definitely not for fit people. Both medium and large felt so loose and out of structure/shape.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Good jacket for ~35°+,5,"Fits just as expected. If it is windy you will want a different jacket. This lets air through, but other than that it’s a perfect jacket"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Warm enough for NC winters, looks great",5,"Looks just like the picture.  Very soft.  Collegiate blue is not too bright, not too dark (I get annoyed by the is-it-blue-or-is-it-black? blues) but doesn't show every bit of dirt, either.  Looks terrific with my son's gorgeous red hair.  Interior pockets are big enough for my son to stash an iPad mini and a game system in a case.  Zipped exterior pockets would be great for keys, money, etc. that are easy to lose.  My son is a thin, 5' 3"" and the men's small fits him with enough extra room to be comfortable-- not as fitted as the picture on him but he would feel constricted if it did.  Plenty warm enough for NC winters."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Comfortable and well made,5,"STYLE:Columbia's fleece is a bit shaggier than most other brands.  This makes it very soft and very warm, but also less ""slick"" than some others.  It doesn't have any nylon patches or extra zippered pockets like many others.  The design is clearly more function than fashion, but the overall cut of the jacket is relatively slim.FIT:I bought this to wear as a second layer under my overcoat and to wear around the office when it gets cold, instead of a cardigan.  I am a shirt size 15.5 32/33 and the medium is a good fit, though it would probably be too tight over a heavy sweatshirt or sweater.QUALITY:Quality is perfect.  No issues with any zippers or seams.OVERALL:For the price, this is an excellent product.  I wear it every day and am giving it five stars.  However, if you are looking for something that will make a fashion statement, then I suggest you look elsewhere."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Very nice looking. Very comfortable,4,"Very nice looking.  Very comfortable.  Sizing accurate.  My only small pet peeve is, as other reviewers have noted, it's really lightweight.  Fine down to about 50 degrees,  but if you go out in temperatures below that this will not keep you warm.  So I will wear this in the spring and fall, and hang on to my 10 year of old similar style (but heavier) Columbia jacket for the winter --- even though it looks a little worn."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Fits like a glove,5,"I'm 5 foot 7 inches, 145 pounds, and the medium size fits perfect. I bought the fleece to wear under my snowboarding jacket on very cold days, and it's a perfect fit without being too bulky underneath the jacket. Even by itself, the fleece is warm enough to wear as a fall or springtime jacket here in Syracuse NY. You can't go wrong with the price, fit, warmth of the fleece. About to purchase another one in a different color just because it's that good. Well done Columbia!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Good, not great, worth only $25",3,"I'm 5'6"", thin build and small size and this runs slightly large in the arms and trunk with just T-shirt underneath, but would probably feel just right with another layer underneath. However, the neck feels just right and if it was any tighter, it would be uncomfortable.Positives - functions well, does keep me warm, color for black top gray bottom is accurate, looks just like the pictureNegative - fleece material feels cheap and would probably wear quickly, pocket lining is a cheap felt that catches onto any skin defect for all but the most moisturized/lubricated of handsBottom line - would NEVER pay more than $25 for this and feel like that is the true MSRP for this item, would've rate this much lower if paid full price"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Positives vs Negatives,3,Positives warm and lightweight. The Shipping was very fast . The negative .I am seeing a lot of different material qualities from jacket to jacket.I had owned one previously seemed like the material was much better . Another thing why are the prices based on color ? Doe a black jacket cost more to make than a blue one ? Or is the price based on how many you have of each ? Makes no sense . Anyway a great warm up jacket for a chilly day. Just wished they would get the quality and pricing fixed .
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Still A Good Fleece,4,"This product or very similar, has been around for over a decade. It was made in Vietnam 12 years ago and was of high quality.(It still fits and wears well). A new one made in Bangladesh is ALMOST as good. Fit is just a little more snug but is fairly true to size chosen. Quality feels good. Collar is a little less wide but okay. Zipper seems to be fine. Pockets are zippered well and quite large. Sleeve bands fit snug but seem fine. Logo attachment seems secure and is stitched on. This is a well priced versatile fleece that seems to still be of good quality and worthy of the Columbia brand logo"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Very nice,5,"I couldn't be happier with this jacket.  It is my first Columbia jacket and I am seriously thinking about buying a second one.  I am 5' 8"" tall and weigh 210 pounds and the X Large fits me perfectly.  Very soft and warm for a light to medium weight jacket.  Probably still will need another type of coat for the really cold weather but this works well for 30 degree F and up or for layering items.  I bought the black one and it is more of a black/dark gray shade but it looks nice.  I did notice that the price of this jacket does vary depending on the color so be aware of that if you are purchasing this."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Good Product, worth the money",4,"Product arrived in time as promised. Product packaging was poor but fortunately no damages. The jacket was packed in a thin plastic clear pouch then stuffed in a air bubble layered envelope.Color - Nice blue color as ordered, No surprises there.Fit - Fits perfect for me.Zipper is  tight and if you are not careful enough you might break it; but I guess it would be more comfortable with the usage. Side pockets are quite useful either to shrub in that gasoline receipt or your hands if it is too cold.material is thick fleece which is quite warm with 1 layer for an external temperature of around 48F and above. I live in MI , so I had to substantiate it further with an outer jacket.Overall, For the price I paid ( $27.0), it is good, worth every penny. The reason I gave only 4 stars, is due to the zipper."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Love Columbia jackets,5,"I own several of these.  They fit well and they're perfect for those 35 degree/sunny - 50 degree/cloudy days when you need to wear SOMETHING on that run to the supermarket, but you don't need a heavier jacket or parka.  These jackets don't weigh me down, they're light and comfortable."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Too Snug at the underarms for a Large Tall thin person,4,The jacket looks nice and the sleeve and back are long enough for a tall person. The only difficulty is the under neath at the arm to shoulder area is too snug. The person that received the jacket is very slender but it is still snug and noticeable by the wearer. I have always found Columbia clothing to run a bit on the small side but I took a chance on this item. The person that got this jacket always wears Large Tall sizes The color shown on the pic on Amazon is also much lighter too. The jacket is several shades darker but it’s still a pleasant color just closer to black than was expected.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Recommended,5,"I really like this fleece jacket. It’s warm enough that I use it as my primary coat throughout the winter - we’re typically in the 40s. Once it get below 40 I generally go with something heavier, but this gets the job done.It is a little tight fitting around the midsection but that’s my fault, not the jackets. Sleeve cuffs are a little on the tight side too but it’s gotten better over time. No major complaints."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"This is my ""office jacket.""",5,"I work in a severely air-conditioned office, so -- unlike most people -- I have to put on a jacket *while I'm at work.*  Strange, I know.But this one is great. It's fleece, so it's comfortable over my work shirt. It's black, which is a nice conservative color. And it's affordable, so I can leave it at work without worrying about it getting stolen and being out a huge sum. Great ""office jacket."""
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Great for the cold,4,I love this jacket! I had a Columbia for work but had to change color for uniform regulation. It says black but it has a kind of shiny look to it to make it look lighter than black. It is thicker than the one I had before so if your moving around a lot you'll get warm. It's great for me cause I work in a refrigerated room and a freezer and it keeps me warm. The quality however is a little less than expected. The stitching on the wrist came undone within 2 weeks of having it
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Nice Basic Fleece,5,"Originally ordered a medium, based on size chart. I'm 6ft 2in, 210lbs. It fit but was too slim for me--like if you took out the slight bagginess you see through the torso in the jacket on the male model. Returned med for a large, which is a tad roomy through the torso, but allows me too wear a heavier layer underneath. Overall, it seems well-made, & I expect it'll be the only fleece jacket I'll ever own again."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Good lightweight jacket,5,Columbia quality. No pilling and no annoying threads popping out everywhere. Just a good lightweight jacket for driving or at the stadium. Large fit me well. A+
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Classic essential piece of gear,5,This is a classic... works great on its own as a light jacket or as a warm layer.  Pairs well with a softshell or rainshell.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Warm and comfortable,5,"I've been looking for a good winter fleece to wear around the house and decided to give this a try.  If anything, I'd say it's warmer than expected as I sometimes leave it unzipped.  And unlike my old one, the zipper doesn't unzip itself from the bottom while wearing it!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Nice but almost certain it’s  fake!,4,"Nice jacket but I am pretty sure it’s a fake, which is a little upsetting to me. I don’t know how they get away with marketing fake Columbia stuff on Amazon."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Columbia Product Quality seems to be decreasing with the years.,3,Just received my Columbia Steens Mtn Full Zip 2.0 Fleece through the mail. On initial inspection the XLT size fits me well.  The thickness or weight of the fabirc seens thinner or lighter than what I would expect from a Columbia fleece at this price ($39.00).  The elastic in the cuffs and waist seem to be of cheaper quality as well feeling thinner and lighter than other similar fleece jackets I’ve had in the past.  Based on this intital observation I give this fleece a 3/5 stars.I will update this review in time to see how this product wears and where my product satisfaction goes.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Runs large, I had to move a size down.",4,"I'm 6'2"" and 185 lbs., and I typically wear a large. But this large was too big for me. So I ordered a medium that fits great.Otherwise I like it, comfortable and warm. I was actually looking for something a little lighter-weight, but I'll put this to good use anyway."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"No insulation whatsoever, what's the point?",1,"This seems to be either a revised product from columbia or a fake. Either way, this item went from mediocre originally to pretty awful currently. Wearing this thing is like wearing mesh with some lint stuck in it. I know this is no wind breaker, but this fleece is extremely permeable making it almost like wearing nothing if there is any amount of air flow. Indoors with no air movement it makes 70 degrees feel like 73, so that is something I suppose."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Nice Jacket,4,"I ordered this jacket for my husband. He requested the jacket be black... so I ordered black however when the jacket came it was a dark grey. I requested a return label to ship it back and get the correct color and again it came and it was dark grey. (I know this sounds ridiculous, but the color is seriously grey.... not black.) Just know if you order the black one you will be getting a dark grey jacket. It is a nice quality jacket, just completely misnamed."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,At this price it's a great buy,4,"I ordered this item to have a jacket for outdoors yard work, walking the dog, etc. It is great for this purpose, and looks nice enough to wear around other people.Was a bit hesitant with picking my size. Usually, I am a large in Europe and oftentimes a medium here in the US. (I'm 6'4, slim.) But I ordered a large just to be on the safe side, since it doesn't matter if a fleece jacket is a little big. Turns out this was a wise move: the jacket is pretty much a good fit, perhaps on the large side, but the arms are just about right. Just 1/4 inch shorter, and I would've had to return it. While I realize my arms are longer than most people's (which comes with my height), it appears strange to me that a fleece jacket doesn't have extra long arms.I haven't washed this item yet, and if it shrinks I'll be in trouble armlengthwise. It produces quite a bit of static electricity that makes one's hair stand up, but I cannot tell if this is due to the winter's dry weather and my body's reaction to it. (I always get electrocuted from all sorts of things, from grocery store carts to door knobs to my car, during the winter.) I expect this problem to go away as soon as I dare wash the jacket - with lots of softener, just to be sure.The jacket has good-sized pockets with zippers and a string to tighten it at the bottom (which is great to keep cold air out). It isn't very thick, but this is not a problem (it IS warm, despite its thinness) unless it is windy - the wind tends to go straight through and can be quite chilling. A thin jacket on top would solve this, undoubtedly."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Nice,5,Just got it don't know how will be outside seems nice. As far as size i typically wear  a large. I'm 5-10 160 lbs  however the medium in seems t fit fine . I ordered both sizes. I called Columbia customer services and they have different sizing charts for different types of outerwear. They told me for this particular jacket medium would be fine if normally wear large..
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Not as pictured,1,"I was looking forward to receiving this package. However, I didn't receive the item as pictured. I would have been happy with the fleece otherwise. As you can see in the photo, the logo is different then the light grey fleece pictured. Not sure if it's a knock-off or what?"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Comfortable but poor sewing that gives out quick!,1,Bought two of these and within two months both have stitching that has given out.  One has lost all of its wrist stitching around the elastic wrist band....the other had stitching give out with the connection to the draw string around the waist.  Columbia products used to last a long time.....these don't hold a candle to MANY previous items I've owned!
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"A great-fitting coat with no hood, but it keeps me warm!",5,"It feels nice and roomy inside, since it's a 5XT coat, even it doesn't have a hood for rain and snow."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Warm nice fit,5,"I have owned Columbia clothing before and I am never disappointed. Great fit - I wear a 2XL. I am 6 ft and about 200 lbs. This can be worn inside on a very cold day or in a drafty office or house, it is that comfortable."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Feels great,5,"I did not get this for temps below 50, but for casual wear on a chilly day or evening, the fleece is soft and comfortable, it is perfect for that,  I am satisfied with the jacket"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Son loved it,5,Bought this for my 18 year old. Tired of seeing him looking like a perp in hoodies all the time. Put the package on his bed and the following morning he was wearing it when he went out the door. Loved it. I've had several of these over the years and I'm a big fan as well. Goes for everything from raking the yard to dinner dates. Wonderful quality product at a great price.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Warm and comfortable fleece,4,"I bought this Columbia men's fleece after missing out on a Northface fleece sale and have to say I am not disappointed at all. The material on this fleece is very comfortable and warm.The only downside (and reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that sometimes one of the zipper pockets doesn't work - moving the zipper up or down does not close the pocket. It still works sometimes but other times it stays open. Not sure if this is a problem for others but for me it's not too bad since I don't need to keep things secured in the pockets that often. And when I do I still have the other pocket whose zipper is still in fully working condition. I do have to say that I've had this fleece for about 5 months now and I feel that this zipper failure is a bit premature.Fitment is pretty much as expected. I'm 6'2"" and around 200 lbs and the Large size fits pretty much perfectly."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,You'll need a lint roller with this one,3,"OK for a lightweight fleece jacket, but the quality isn't what I expect from Columbia; maybe this is their low-end production model. It's pretty thin, not even as heavy as an average hoody. And although it's what I would have called “fitted” in style, it has kind of a weird cut that is not that flattering when it's zipped up. My teen son is using this jacket but has already asked for a nicer replacement.And BEWARE if you have pets: this fleece is a magnet for dog hair! Tag shows “Made in Sri Lanka” for those interested in little details."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,So far it's a great value for the price and would buy it again ...,5,"I'm 5' 11"" and weight 180 lbs. my chest size is 41"". This in the large size, for me, fit perfectly...any smaller would have been too tight with under garments ...any larger would have been too roomy. This fleece jacket has two front zipper pockets and two inside pockets, behind the two front pockets, that are opened with no zippers. It has a concealed draw cord at the bottom of the jacket to prevent drafts up the jacket.  So far its holding up well...I've only had it about a week. I ordered it in black and when it came it look a little lighter than a deep black...I would call it a ""smokey black"" probably due to a reflection of light on the fleece.  So far it's a great value for the price and would buy it again for another."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Nice jacket,4,Columbia has come along way. From the Walmart brand to some top end outdoors gear.  This jacket is nice. It does seem big but for me its hard because I am right between L and XL. Went with XL and it is just a little bit big but i like it.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Lightweight and warm,5,"Love this jacket.I am an aircraft mechanic, and it’s lightweight coupled with the warmth and relatively thin material allows me to get into tight places on the aircraft without taking off my jacket and freezing while I work.Keeping my core temp up prevents my fingers from being cold and insensitive to small parts that may otherwise drop or get lodged in places that require disassembling parts of the plane to retrieve."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Fits Just Right....,5,"I actually love this jacket. Was actually looking for something that was in the color Black, but decided to add some lighter apparel. Fits perfectly and is soft and lite. Not to snug or tight. Fits the chest and waist just right.. Very nice.... Thanks"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Excellent quality, as with Columbia brand",5,"Excellent quality, as with Columbia brand, you always get quality! Soft. Warm. Fabric is non-pilling. I wash in cold with other clothes and let air dry. Did not shrink. True to size and arrived on time. I know they have competition with North Face and Under Armour... I've bought all 3 brands over the years for the family.... I'll always recommend Columbia coats, jackets, mittens, gloves, hats, ect."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Recommend if u do not require ""Tall"" sizing",3,"Had to score this low on principle alone. If ur a Prime member and u get ur merch 8 days late due to seller sending to the wrong place, it's unacceptable. Also product ordered was supposed to be ""tall"" but wears like a normal size. Product is nice though... if u don't mind the wait or are of regular size go ahead and order with confidence"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Love! But one issue.,3,I love this jacket I’ve got four in different colors. That’s how committed to then brand I am. However even this one I have now has threading problems! I would give a five star because of comfort but I simply can’t. I have the same problem every time. After a few washes the threads seems to come loose from around the wrist and sides which slowly makes the jacket fall apart over time. That is the only complaint I have.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Fabric is pilling. I heard they make special detergent for these things by the way,3,"It fit all right after I shrank it in the dryer. The only thing is, the fabric is starting to pill on the sleeves. You know, I think some of these “name brand” products on here are knock-offs and it wouldn’t surprise me if this one is. But the price was right. Maybe no one wanted the grey color and that’s why it was so cheap."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Solid,5,"I ordered a medium for my husband, it fits pretty well and I like the charcoal color. I have one for myself too, the only downfall of the fleece is that strong winds bellow right through the fleece so you feel it. Good for a layer under another jacket, or days that aren’t windy."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Good jacket,5,I use this jacket for work as we can’t use hoodies and to be honest it’s a good jacket. For only 25 bucks you can’t ask for much more it is a bit on the loose fit side of things but I expected this as my previous jackets fit just like this one 10/10 would buy again.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,dropped two STARs when the zipper FAILED just after a month,3,"I have another of these I obtained a couple of years ago, it is still good and has never failed.  After a month this one broke it's zipper.  Still using it as it is just an insert into my rain duster, but did not care for the failed zipper!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Very good product!,5,"My husband couldn’t be happier. He never tries clothes before buying it, so it took a while for me to figure what he likes so I could buy it for him from the first shot. He loves these jackets so much, and he got two of them already different colors. The size is XL Long, and it’s perfect for 6’4. Very soft and warm!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Comfortable, but bad zipper.",3,"This fleece was great. I thought it was very well made, and most of it is. Unfortunately the zipper fell to pieces in the wash. Hence, the fleece is no longer functional.  My experience is that Columbia products typically last much longer than 3 months."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Price was great and fits like it’s supposed to!,5,It fits great but I actually thought it was going to be brown and not green I see y’all don’t have a brown but the green is fine  so all is well!
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Great Fleece Jacket for Spring or Fall!  I own two,5,This is a nice fleece jacket!!  It is on the thin side as fleece jackets go but that can be just right depending on the temperature.. The sizes run large. I would normally wear a large and ended up getting a medium. I like the color and fit of the jacket. My wife keeps borrowing it so I bought a second one in another color so I would have two. The price is good as well and it was nice having it delivered.Would I purchase this item again knowing what I know now? Definitely!  Would I recommend this product to someone else?  Yes.Hope you have good results.David
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Very impressed,5,"My husband was looking for a jacket to wear in his man cave to avoid turning the heater on & this jacket has done nothing but exceed expectation. I was a little worried on color combo (brown blue) but I don’t hate it. It keeps him warm, he’s happy so I’m happy!! Worth almost getting another one for back up!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,An essential winter garment,4,"Pros: This fleece is really soft and warmer than it looks considering how lightweight it is. The elastic at the ends of the sleeves keep them snug while using much less real estate than your usual sweatshirt. The zippers on the pockets and adjustable waist are nice touches.Cons: I originally bought the large because that's my usual size. The sleeves fit perfectly but the rest of the garment was considerably too large. I returned it and got a medium instead, which fit wonderfully, with the exception of the sleeves being a little shorter than I'd like.Overall, it's a great product at a great price."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,This jacket does not breathe,2,"I was expecting this to be similar to my 2 other Columbia Fleece jackets-- I bought this one for the great color. But this fabric does not breathe at all so it becomes hot quickly. I have been intending to return it but missed the last day by two days.  Oh well, I'll donate it."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0, Soft Fleece with Classic Fit",4,Jacket is exactly what I expected.  A wonderful jacket.  I purchased a 2nd one as a backup.Jacket was $70.00 at Big and Tall store....$30.00 from seller.  Great jacket for a great price.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Columbia Quality,5,"Easily the best of the eight or so fleece sweaters I've got. The thick, warm fleece is hard to be when there's a slight chill in the air. Fits as expected, with nice features. Only knock I'd give is that it seems some colors are not available and are priced differently, probably supply/demand..."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Recommended Jacket!,5,"I bought this jacket and had it sent to my son who is a Freshmen in college.  The weather where he is at was getting cooler, so I did a Prime order to him.  I checked up on him with his jacket to make sure he got it and it was working for him.  Who said ""My Columbia?  I wear it all the time""  So with that response, I give this jacket a thumbs up.  My son is warm and he wears it on a regular basis.  The Prime order worked well also.  I love being able to get what he needs off of Amazon and get it sent to him Prime."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Quality material feels nice to wear,4,"Quality material feels nice to wear. Stylistically it's run of the mill but the neck isn't too tight when zipped as most are for me. I'm 6' and lean and ordered the large. And, while the waist fits well, the body tends to puff out. Definitely made to accommodate some serious beer belly. After going through the dryer it's shrunk a little and seems a better fit. Zipper is quality. Being Columbia, it will last. I may look for something a little more form fitting next time though."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,I live in these.,5,"I wear the Columbia fleece every day. They are very soft and comfortable. The zippered pockets hold my phone, wallet, and keys.  I wear it like a sweater even at home since it allows me to leave my apartment cooler yet to still be comfortable. I wear it under my winter coat, and as an outer layer in milder weather. When I was it I just hang it over the back of a chair and it dries overnight. I maintain at least two of these so I have a second one to wear when the other is being washed and dried. I have worn these for at least ten years. They are very durable and last a long time. The ones I have are still in good shape, but I bought this new one only because I have lost weight and needed a smaller size. I am ordering a second one in the smaller size."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Husband Loved It,5,"My husband needed something cozy while dealing with the chills of chemo.  This was so perfect and he loved it so much, I ordered a 2nd color to keep in the car so he always has one handy."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Comfortable house and pound around jacket,5,I wear this thing every day around the house in the winter months and outside a lot in Colorado.  It fit me great and has help up to daily use.  I like the exterior and interior pockets. I would buy again.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,A pox on pizza theif.,5,"Good jacket. Pretty warm, you will need to layer if you're getting into temperatures under literal freezing. That's 0°C/32°F, for those who dropped out of junior high. It definitely retains heat when zipped up. I wouldn't wear this if it's 70+. You'll get sweaty quick. Lots of pockets. Fits well, the black will show dirt pretty quick. I really liked this thing. It is made in China, for those whom it may concern. This jacket is so good, in fact, that some copulator of maternal figures had to go and swipe it while I had it in the break room at work. I bet it was the same guy that stole my pizza out of the fridge, and just left the crust in the box as if I wouldn't notice."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,SIZE UP FOR BIG SHOULDERS!!!,5,"It fits well, I'm normally a 2XT, but after reading the reviews, I decided on the 3XT. A bit big, but good through the shoulders. So when I layer it'll work out fine. It's just a bit big through the middle.Otherwise, a very well made and comfortable jacket. I'm going to wear it this morning, only 23° outside!!I highly recommend this jacket! But your normal size unless you have wide shoulders like me from sports my whole life!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Well-made mostly winter jacket,5,"I believe clothes shopping with my 15 yr old son to guage size, fit, and likeability in multiple stores my own personal circle of hell. There's a lot of deep breathing exercises. And in comes Amazon. This coat really impressed me when it arrived. Wasn't sure it would be warm enough. My son all of a sudden despised the Columbia type winter jackets. Wanted more, I don't know, lived in style. Think Beatnik practical. I humored him (anything to keep from going back into the hell of clothes shopping) and was really impressed. This coat is heavy. Seriously. Thick and lined. The price is great for a name brand item and the product you receive. Keeps my nightmare inducing offspring warm and we live in Idaho with stupid single digit weather for weeks. You live closer to Canada, may wanna consider a parka. This won't cut it. Oh! And for reference. He's 5'7"", lanky but really filled out because of weight training. The medium fits beautifully."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Great Fit, Durable Material",5,"I was skeptical at first about this jacket, but boy was I blown away when I got it. This jacket is the real deal. I am 6'1"" 160 lbs and the medium fits me perfectly. The body of the jacket is lined with a type of fur and the pockets are lined with fleece (perfect for my cold hands!). The  material a kind of durable cotton, super tough. The hoodie is nice and big so it fits over my head all the way (A lot of jackets I've seen have tiny hoods that don't fit). The hoodie part is removable, but I don't think I'll ever remove it. Everything about this jacket is super durable and I am very happy with it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,GREAT COAT,5,"Coat was $45 because it was a return “like new”. I always buy things when that are on wish list when Amazon lowers the moolah after someone returns the item without proper packaging, labels or something that really doesn’t have anything to do with item. I’ve found that the % Amazon lowers is all over the place on different items, some high, some low. On this coat the regular price was $68 bucks and I got it for $44 so I saves me some good samoleons.  Ok ok why am I wasting your time telling you how I save $$$$$ on this coat? If something you want has “almost new” buy it if it’s a great savings because I’ve done this a lot and never found the item has anything wrong. another example a pair of work boots that I saved 45%."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,I ordered black and got.... a very very dark navy? Or is it black? I have no idea!,3,"I'm rating this 3 stars, not because the jacket doesn't fit well or look good, but because I'm not sure if I got the right color!Let me start off with the good: This jacket is AWESOME! The feeling of it on is very comfortable and is a perfect fit for my body (Broad shoulders @ 6'0"" 170lbs) and looks absolutely amazing. I've never had a jacket that I felt looked this good. Genuinely! The interior lining is comfy, the pocket is quite deep, the hood can easily be removed, and can easily be worn on the daily!Now the bad (I won't be mentioning the color issue here since that's not a fault of the jacket itself): My levis logo on my chest pocket seems to have gotten hit by a bit of dye during manufacturing and comes off as low quality when you look at it (pictured). I'm sure this could easily be fixed so I'm honestly not too annoyed with this. The armpit area is actually quite tight. Personally, I've always had this issue with medium-sized jackets so I honestly don't blame the jacket for this, it's simply my body type. Something to know if you're thinking of buying this, though. Overall, these issues really don't bother me and wouldn't stop me from ever buying this jacket again!The reason I've subtracted 2 stars: The label on the interior of the jacket does indeed say ""NVY"" in its color ID. However, the label on the bag says black. DOUBLE HOWEVER, upon close examination of the sticker that's underneath the other inventory stickers, it states that this jacket is originally a navy jacket (pictured)! Although... everyone I've asked has said the jacket looks black to them but does have a bit of blue in there. I'm honestly not 100% sure this is black or not. To me, it looks very black but does have a smidge of blue in it and could possibly pass as a navy jacket, perhaps in broad daylight. This might be difficult to see in the pictures so I guess you'll just have to take my word for it.As of right now (9/8/2020) I've contacted Amazon support (Amazon was the seller in this scenario) and have arranged for a replacement which should be here in a few days. If the replacement is a genuine black label and it still looks the same, I'll tally this up to an error in the factory and be done with it. I'll be sure to post a few pictures of it on myself as well so people can get an idea of what it looks like on my body type!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great Jacket **two things to note,4,"I love this jacket (with two small caveats), but overall it is great!I am 5' 11"" at 165 lbs and the medium was a very good fit. I would say that anyone more than a couple inches taller than me should probably get a large because of the length.Bottom line is I would definitely recommend this jacket if you are ok with two minor things to be aware of (see below).Pros:~The jacket is very warm, with fleece-lined pockets (which is nice for cold hands) and it stands up to wind very well~Very good build quality - all seems feel very good and I don't see any messy stiching~Good, metal zippers and cord stops~Good fit for someone with an athletic to moderate frame (I usually find jackets too large in the stomach and too small in the shoulders, but this jacket is very good)~Looks much better than a standard winter coat for wearing to school, events, etcCons:~The color in the photos is NOT the color I received (ordered khaki, but mine is much darker, almost army green) - see photo~During normal use, the inside sleeve material has a tendency to fold out past the end of the sleeves. I have tried ironing them and pulling them back into the jacket, but they always end up like this after a day of wearing. - see second photoIf these two things don't bother you then go for it!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Amazon selling a batch of factory defects?,1,"I'm now returning my 3rd jacket.When I first ordered the jacket, the buttons were installed too close to the zipper such that the zipper was snagging on the buttons. Definitely a defect, so I sent it back with no hassle through Amazon.My replacement was defective too, however. There were no buttons on the cuffs, the sleeves felt shorter, and the inside polyester material protruded, all of which looked noticeably ""off"" to people who hadn't even seen the proper construction of the jacket. Also, the two pockets over the top of the buttoned pockets on the front of the jacket were sewn shut (or non-existent). Since my first jacket had both of these things right (if not the buttons), I knew this one was defective as well. So I sent it back.The third jacket I received was the same as the second. So now I'm sending it back again.I'm thankful for Amazon's painless returns, but it really seems like they're selling the Levi's factory defects. It's incredibly frustrating to think that winter might be over before I even get a good jacket."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Weird fit for tall, skinnier guys.",3,"I'll start by saying I'm about 6'1 and 170lbs, athletic/slender. I ordered a large because I like to layer in cold weather. From the pictures of the model wearing it and the reviews, I expected this coat to be a little more form fitting, but so far it seems a little boxy. It is also a lot shorter than I expected. It sits right at my belt. If I zip it and lift my arms shoulder height, it comes up above my belt. If I lift my arms over my head, it rises above my belly button. Also seems loose in the lower back, which will allow cold air in for sure. It fits well otherwise.. chest, shoulders and arms are comfortable. There's about a $60 difference between what I paid for the large and the large-tall size, so I may end up just returning it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,This jacket had potential,4,"The jacket is decent, I actually purchased two of them in the color navy/size medium. First thing I did was run it through the washer/warm water & threw it in the dryer/hot cycle & the shrinkage was very minimal but noticeable & fit me a bit too snug, I did stretch the jacket out a bit with my hands, manually & was successful in doing so. Am slim/fit 5’11 & 155 pounds, pants size 30x32 & the jacket sat slightly below my waist, not wide or baggy, just snug, sleeve length seemed normal, the jacket is restrictive in the shoulder area, don’t raise your arms. I don’t ever recommend going a size up or down but, that’s just me personally. The inside of the jacket is made up of some kind of rough furry material, the roughness was kinda disappointing. The jacket overall looks good, with or without the hoodie, the hoodie is removable. The jacket is neither light or heavy."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Makes me feel like Steve Bannon just after the election!,5,"This is a sweet jacket.  Feel very high quality and well made.  Looks kind of like that jacket Steve Bannon wore all the time just after Trump won the election, but this jacket has a hoodie, so gives off a younger vibe.  The ""hoodie"" is a faux hoodie zipped into the jacket itself.  It can easily be ""zipped"" out of the jacket.  It's thicker without looking thicker.  It's got a faux wool inner lining.  It actually looks like a light spring/autumn jacket, but I'm sure you can also wear it in winter too.  It's pretty warm.  Someone says you can't really wear it in 75 degree weather and I'm inclined to agree with that.  I usually fit into a medium and I got a medium here and it fit perfectly.  I got olive and mine was in a little darker olive than I'm use to, but I'm sure it will lighten-up after a few washes.  Overall very pleased with this purchase."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,I was pleasantly surprised.,5,"I'm only 5'9'' but have wider shoulders and chest than half of the NFL, so needless to say it's rare I find clothes that fit my odd body-style. I ordered a 3x Big and Tall, and to my surprise this jacket doesn't feel tight across my back and shoulders, but still isn't so huge and puffy that it looks ridiculous on me. Which I almost never find clothes that aren't at least one or the other.I'm so pleased with the fit that I'll be ordering a 2nd jacket to keep in the closet 'just in case.' Build-quality wise? I can't say anything about it's durability as I haven't owned it for any length of time, but from what I can tell by inspecting it, it looks well enough made. I'm sure this jacket will be adequate for West Virginia winters(15-30ish F, generally) if you aren't working outside in it, or maybe even then if you put on a thermal shirt under it.All in all, I would say this is a pretty good jacket at the price point."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Good fit, warm jacket",4,"This is just about what I was looking for in a multi-use lined jacket. Love the well-cut field jacket look and the removable “hoodie” bib is fine. Roomy enough to wear another layer underneath if needed (flannel or real hoodie, for example). The deep cotton lined pockets are a nice touch, though the lining isn’t very thick.The sherpa lining isn’t super heavy, though it’s reasonably warm. It’s the kind that will pill over time and need maintenance. Sleeves are lined with quilted polyester, which needs some help when it’s really cold out.Overall it feels well made, comfortable, and warm. Recommended!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Satisfied customer,5,"Bought this jacket for 25 year old son. Love the look of the jacket for casual everyday use. It has a false hoodie sewn into the coat - not removable, which ads to the look and provides a hood if needed. Jacket seems to be quite rugged and durable as you would expect from Levi’s. My son is 5’ 10” and quite thin. Ordered a small and it fits, allowing room for heavier undergarments. Had previously ordered from Kohl’s. It was in stock, but the processing took so long (weeks) that I eventually received a message that it was no longer available. Ordered from Amazon at a slightly better price and had it within days!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Great jacket, good quality, warm.",5,"This is a really great jacket.  It's comfortable, looks great, has plenty of pockets (two to shove your hands into, two on the chest, two that are under flaps on top of the hand pockets, and one interior pocket), the hood is voluminous, and does a great job keeping the wind out.  The interior pocket could stand to be a little bigger but not a real issue, my Samsung S7 Active with extra chunky case fits just nicely but i don't think i could shove my Kindle in there.  The removable hood comes off with a zipper if you dont want the hoodie look.  You could wear the hood separately if you wanted to look funny.  I looked at all the Levis jackets offered on Amazon and i went with this one and i do not regret my choice.  Great price too.Only one issue i ran into, when putting it on, make sure you do the thing where you throat your second arm in the air when you pull it over the shoulders, i heard a stitch pop when i tried to jerk my arm in the sleeve.  But that's more about body mechanics and the nature of a heavy canvas being sewn into a wearable form.  It's not a sweatshirt, so you know, no stretching."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Well I’ll be!!!,4,So I thought this was gonna be a spring fall jacket but it’s totally late fall winter jacket. There really is some bulk to it it doesn’t look like there is on the model… I’m thinking I could of went with a 2x being 5’6 and 259 lbs but I went with the 3x and well once I lose weight I can sell it to a bigger person.. even after like 2-3 years if I don’t get burn marks on it from cigarettes or something like that the way it’s made looks like it can be worth 50-60 dollars even after some good use to the right person who understands Levi is worth money… I will definitely buy it in smaller sizes once I lose about 100 lbs if they come out with this make.. this jacket will definitely withhold 30 degrees maybe even 20 with a flannel under neath!!! Thank you Levi and thank you amazon!!! I’m only giving it a 4 star because I thought it was a spring fall jacket and because it was a day late getting to me other than that it totally is worth 5 stars!!! This was definitely a good purchase!!! Can wait to wear it outside in late fall once it gets cold enough!!!
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,My new favorite jacket!,5,"I got this yesterday and washed it immediately following the care instructions. It came out fine. The brown is actually brown and the medium is actually medium but with some space for a layer (perfect for a hoodie). I’m 5’10” 135lbs so I’m thin with long arms. It fits great. The only issue I had was one of the main closure buttons fell off. Contacted Levi’s and they said to send it in for inspection and possible replacement with the same or similar item. I ordered a replacement through Amazon but just canceled that order because I reattached the button with Gorilla Super Glue Gel. It feels secure enough considering I mainly use the zipper and may never use the buttons. It sits just below the waist, has two outer chest pockets with button closure, two outer hand pockets with no closure, and one inner chest pocket with no closure. The removable hood is kinda cool but I removed and will be wearing actual hoodies under this jacket.I don’t know why people rate this jacket anything under 5 stars. Receiving the wrong color/size doesn’t warrant a bad review; it warrants a return/replacement. It’s actual denim and the care instructions say to dry on low heat. If you follow those instructions, you won’t have any fabric melting. I also don’t see how the sleeve lining can ever come out past the cuffs. I’m keeping this forever."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Tight in the shoulders, shoulder straps give cheesy look...",3,"Nice material and sturdy zipper. Didn’t like the straps on the shoulder, not a fan of the Bea Arthur look, I’m not a Golden Girl.My biggest problem was the fit. If you have broad shoulders, or even above average shoulder width this jacket will not fit. If you have little shoulders, which is the norm, you’re probably good to go."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"6'2 190 lbs, returning Large for X-Large",4,"I'm 71 years old, 6'2 190 lbs, medium build, and a Dickies Large pocket-tee is a perfect fit for me. Wearing a tee shirt and a thin Amazon Basics sweater underneath, this Large-size jacket is too tight across chest/shoulders and belly. I could barely zip it closed. Arms were short also, exposing about 3-4 inches above wrists with arms extended.  The olive color is deep and even, much like unwashed military fatigues. The one I received doesn't have a washed look at all, but it is a nice, soft dark olive. Very good looking.  The quality seems really good. I'm returning this one for an X-Large.UPDATE Jan 9, 2020:  The XL is a good fit.  I wear it with hoodie removed.  Zipped, with arms extended horizontal to the sides, sleeves cover the wrists; unzipped, with hands on a steering wheel or a keyboard, sleeves are about 2""-3"" above wrists, and jacket is quite snug across the back.  I'll keep this one, but if it shrinks and I order another one, it will be XXL."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Love the look of it, quality seems decent for the price, strange fit",3,"I'm 5'8"", 140-145 lbs, 30-31 waist depending on the brand of pants. I initially went with a medium. It was too big. The sleeves were too long and it just felt a bit sloppy on me. I exchanged it for a small. The sleeve length is good for me in the small. However, something about the cut or the way the sleeves are attached to the body results in the body hiking up a bit when I lift my arms. It's not a deal-breaker for me, but not exactly ideal. The other thing is that if I zip up the zipper for the outer jacket, the fit at the waist is somewhat snug. Again, not a deal-breaker. I can zip it, it's just a little tighter than I'd prefer. Leaving that zipper undone and zipping only the hoodie zipper results in a much more comfortable fit."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Very Warm and Tough,5,"I bought this jacket more than a year and a half ago. I use it in everday social situations, and also for rugged outdoor use (camping, etc). It looks nice to wear around town, but it is also tough as nails. It is not super duper thick and huge, so you can also wear it normally in the spring and fall. I washed it a few times, and it still retains its normal look and feel. It's simple and basic looking, and I like that.What I liked best is the surprising warmth that it provides. I wore it while I was up in the Arctic Circle in winter. Even out on a frozen lake in the dead of night, it was all I needed up there. I did not expect that. I was worried about freezing to death in those conditions, so had also brought along a big puffy snow coat for the cold, but I never needed it with this jacket on.Kudos to the makers of this coat."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Poor quality. Shop elsewhere.,2,"This jacket has multiple problems. First, it is way to tight around the shoulders to the point that squeezes my biceps like a vice grip. I know I got the ""right"" size though because all of the lengths are correct. However, it feels like the jacket was designed in 2 dimensions without considering the 3 dimensional movement of a person. Second, the zipper gets stuck and is a pain in the butt to use. Third, I had the jacket 2 days and I already found a loose thread as shown in the photo. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because it did technically keep me warm at work albeit with extremely restricted range of motion in my arms. Shop elsewhere."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Received 2, returned 2. Both defective.",1,"I typically wear an XL, so that's the first size I tried. When it arrived it fit pretty decent, but the arms and shoulders seemed very short. I returned that, and ordered the XLT instead. The new one arrived, and has the same exact issue. The jacket got larger in the mid section, but there was 0 change to the arm length. Also, this 2nd jacket I received had it's zipper jamming like someone else had already returned it and it had either white dog or cat hair on it. I will not be ordering from this online store anymore. I see other reviews suspecting these are all defective as well."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Actual size of the jacket is not the same as what the tags are showing,1,"When you purchase this jacket, the size inside the jacket is not the same as the jacket itself. For my own purchaseExample:I ordered a standard medium - I received an XXL.  Tags says medium.I Returned it and ordered a standard medium again. This time received a small (again tag says medium)The jacket appears to be made well, it is LEVI’S. But has been made in China.I am Purchasing the jacket for my Dad who lives in a care facility and is always cold.  This is causing me extreme frustration and unnecessary delays. There seems to be no way to contact the seller direct about this. I’m thinking that I cannot be the only customer this is happening to."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great looking coat,5,"I like the coat very much - cannot wait for winter.  It is a bit less khaki than I expected, and a bit olive, but not nearly as green as the olive green choice on the website.  I am 5' 11"" and 170 pounds.  I tried the Large with a typical sweatshirt I wear in winter and it was too tight when moving my arms as in driving.  I then tried the Large Tall with the same sweatshirt and it is a good fit - I like coat sleeves a bit long.  (The photo shows the coat hanging on a clothes line - the narrow shadow is the clothesline.)"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Pretty decent jacket,4,"Buttons on shoulder were defective right off the bat so I needed a safety pin so the flaps stayed on. That and the zippers feel a bit flimsy.That being said, it looks solid. It's exactly what I was looking for. Color was not very khaki as other reviews say. A little bit green. The pockets are smaller than I would like too. My phone feel like if could call out pretty easy.Very warm too. I do layer it but it's kept me warm in a midwest winter.It's a bit short too. Your lower back is exposed if you raise arms high or when you sit in your seat in the car."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Really Awesome Jacket!,5,"Bought the SM size and it fit as expected but felt a tad roomy for a small. I'm 5'8 and 155lbs, fit/slim physique. It is very warm with the fabric that's sewn on the inside. I also like how you can upzip and remove the hoodie. The fabric feels of good quality, durable stuff. As for the color, it's a bit off from the pictures here. I got the Khaki color but it's more like dark khaki and/or a shade of olive/khaki. Not a biggie since the jacket itself is still great. The jacket also matches with a lot of my other clothes which is awesome! Can't believe the msrp tag shows it as $180. Got it for $80, that's like 50% off!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Buy This!,5,"I LOVE this jacket. The jacket is amazing quality, super thick, and warm. I love that you can remove the sweatshirt bits and the hood as well. I bought this for my boyfriend as one of his Christmas gifts and he admires every aspect and now wears this jacket out all of the time. You will not be disappointed in any way. This item is worth even more than what I paid for. It is true to size, 100%. My boyfriend is 5'9 ish, 160 pounds, and we ordered a medium. Fits perfectly with wiggle room."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,This is a real Levi-Quality Jacket!,5,"I was very pleased when this jacket arrived as it lived up to all my expectations as to size, quality, and features. It is very sturdy and very warm, with plenty of pocket space. This will be my cold weather coat until it wears out, which will probably be many years in the future. However, be aware that the size is to fit so if you like your coats a little loose you may want to get a size larger. A nice feature is that you can drive comfortably with the coat zipped up."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Large was too short, large tall was too baggy (baggier than regular large?)",4,"Poor fit, jacket is too large.  I bought tge same jacket elsewere in a large and almost loved the fit BUT it was too short.  Showed my belly button when I lifted my arms.  SO, I order the large tall and give the large to my brother since he's shorter than me (I'm 6'2, 220lbs).  However, the large tall is MUCH baggier than the large.  It's just a much looser fitting jacket overall, anf not characteristic of the photos or description.  2 stars because it's warm and cozy, but poor quality control over at Levis."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Size 3X does not exist. Manufacturer and/or Amazon error.,1,"Went through two replacements through Amazon. The bag is labeled '3X', the tag attached to the sleeve is labeled '3X', but the inside tag on the collar reads 'XLT'. 'Extra Large Tall' is not the same size as 'Extra Extra Large', obviously. Called up Amazon and requested a refund, as obviously a bunch of these are mislabeled from the manufacturer. They told me ""after an investigation"" they would likely make this product unavailable, but I'm telling you now, do not order because they are all mislabeled and you will end up with the wrong size."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,More than expected,5,"When looking for an affordable light weight yet warm work jacket I began to suspend all of my searches until, luckily, I  found this one.  It was exactly what I was looking for and it's from Levis.  Zipper with snaps is one of the biggest pluses for me.  I don't know how many zippers on previous work jackets just split offline while bending or reaching that I've gone through. With the extra security of the snaps, there's little or no chance the zipper will pull apart.  Only time will tell of it's durability but so far, so good!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Nice heavy duty jacket! Tough, looks great, nicely made!",5,"Material is heavy duty and stitching is spot on, this is a quality made, casual jacket.I do like the casual look of this jacket, the style is relaxed and comfortable, but looks good. Jacket lining will certainly keep you warm. Not sure if I'll keep the hoodie/ liner, but probably will ... just takes a little getting used to, since it's not really a hoodie. Lots of pockets, it'll be my go-to jacket this winter. All in all, I like it!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Not for broad shoulders,5,"This jacket is awesome. It is well-made, looks great, and really warm. I bought this for my dad and he had pretty broad shoulders. He typically wears an XL, but I had to exchange the first one I bought for a size up. It fit him everywhere else, but the shoulders were way too tight. The XXL was much more accommodating in the shoulders. The sleeves also seemed a little short on the XL. I'd suggest going one size up if you have wide shoulders or find that sleeve length is usually a problem for you."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Perfect!,5,"I had been needing to get a new coat for quite some time, but I guess I'm kinda picky on coat styles. I had seen this coat at JCP (both online and at the store) and had decided to pick one up. I wanted to compare prices with Amazon before purchasing, and I'm glad I did! I was able to pick this coat up cheaper on Amazon (regular price) than JCP was offering it for close out a week ago! The jacket looks great and is quite warm. I'm a pretty big guy (6'3"", 220#) so I got an XL big and tall. When I first got the coat it seemed a little too big, but after washing and drying it once it fits perfectly for my tastes."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Used jacket was sold as new!! Uhggghhhh!!!!,1,I purchased this jacket for my brother’s birthday. It was advertised as new. It’s not. There were no tags on the jacket. There was lint on the lining indicating that it had been worn and there was a Bic lighter in the left pocket. I got it yesterday because his birthday is next Friday. I hope I have time to replace it. I am truly disappointed. I had to leave a one star rating in order to submit my review.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Levi quality is there!!,5,"I am very happy with the jacket honestly I was expecting to be disappointed! I have been wearing Levi jackets my whole life usually the black denim I guess they call them trucker jackets? With the white cotton liner. That said I was worried going with a different style. I must say it actually fits very well very comfortable and heck the price was fair.I still want the other jacket maybe Santa will bring me one or maybe he will bring one to another who may not have a jacket at all!John, Central Ca."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,fits just fine and I can zip it up with no problem,5,"Fits me well. Bought  the extra large. I am 5'9"", 225 pounds. Problems with most shirts and jackets in the hip area but this coat, although a little snug,  fits just fine and I can zip it up with no problem.  Very comfortable and I like the casual look. Haven't been in real cool weather yet but looks to be substantial enough to be good for 40-50 degrees.  Also the color, as mentioned by others, isn't the same khaki as pictured. It's more of a brownish- olive color which is not a dealbreaker for me."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Nice looking jacket,4,"First and foremost this jacket looks nice. I bought the black jacket and it looks just like the picture and being black it pretty much goes with anything.I've been wearing it the last few weeks and it seems fairly durable, and decently warm. Now depending on what you consider cold this may be a winter jacket for you. Here in the great lakes where it will drop to -10 to -20F I'd probably go with something a bit warmer, but further south where it doesn't get much below freezing this would be plenty warm enough.As far as fitment goes its a bit tight on me through the back and arms. I am a bit a bit of a gorilla though, but I do look good in this jacket so its worth the slightly tight fit."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Fits really snug for XXL, especially in the shoulders and chest.",5,"Normally xxl will fit with room to spare in case I need to add layers under the coat. But this Levi xxl is very snug in the shoulder area and the chest area doesn't have much room to spare either. I am returning for the xxxl so hopefully it'll be a better fit. As far as the coat itself, it's awesome! I love the color, style, and the quality of materials. Heavy duty thick cotton. Other than the fit issue, this is an excellent coat."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Awesome coat,5,"I got this for my overgrown teen. He loves it, and so do I. The construction appears solid, the hoodie under military field jacket style is great. With zipper beneath snaps, it'll keep out the wind, and attached hood is comfy. My son runs hot, so I think this will do for winter, but it's loose enough on him that he'll be able to layer underneath if needed."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Cheap Material,1,"It looks and fits great, I found it comfortable and fairly warm... however it has the durability of a cheap dress shirt. Wore it maybe 6 or 7 times, was just putting it on and it ripped right up the armpit. Liked it but would not recommend"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Ordered Khaki no-lining twice, got khaki (green) with sherpa lining twice.",4,"Amazing jackets. Solid, thick, warm. Too bad Amazon seems incapable of sending me the correct jacket. Ordered khaki, no lining, got a khaki (as others mentioned, it's not khaki) with sherpa lining. See photo. Had some extra cash so immediately re-ordered the Khaki with no lining and again got a khaki with sherpa lining. Luckily, I REALLY liked this jacket, so I kept one. Wonder where I'm going to actually buy a Khaki no-lining from now. Not Amazon. Consider it a crap shoot when you click that buy button. Kinda sad."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Perfect Fit,5,"Fits great! Looks great! Heavy. Hoodie (hood and front sweatshirt strip of material) unzip from jacket if desired. The material is heavy duty, will hold up well. Warm. Comfortable. Nice long arm lengths to meet wrist where expected. Zipper works great. Lining well made. Seams well sewed. Not too bulky to move in, even in the car with seatbelt on or shoveling snow. It was a perfect choice."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great jacket,5,"Great jacket. Looks good and fits good. Feels like it's well made and not going to fall apart on you. The zipper and snaps help with that as opposed to sewn on buttons. Feels sort of like a modern take on the M-65 field jacket, though a bit shorter. It's not really designed for winter weather but if you wear a hoodie underneath, you're good down to about freezing (32°F / 0°C). If you plan to be outside for an extended period of time in anything colder than that, or if it's snowing, you'll probably need more layers (and length)."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Wrong size shipped again,  Nice jacket..",4,Well I thought the 3rd time would be a charm but to no avail..  its a nice jacket but Amazon cannot seem to get it right..  3 times i've ordered an XXL on to recieved an XL.  So back it goes again..  OK now I have good news the 4th one just arrived and it's great.  fits good and is the correct size..  Customer service was really good about giving me the same price that I purchased it at originally which was 48.00.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Very Nice Jacket!,5,"This is a great jacket as others have said. Better than I expected actually. Was worried based on the reviews on the size but it's​ close to perfect right out of the box (I'm a 5'4 manlet and small fits perfectly). Some reviews have said it will shrink in the dryer which I think will make it perfect. The inner lining hood is great, quality and a quick zip out to remove. Love the hand warmer pockets with snaps. Well thought out with Levi's​ quality. Best cotton jacket I have ever bought."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,terrible.,1,"I can't believe this anymore, this is my story I bought the first jacket size L, in the levis brand I am usually in jackets I am L, but this one is very wide so I returned it and bought it again size M, but I returned them  3 times because they always send me a size S, I bought it again again arrives on Tuesday, February 25 I hope that size M arrives which I've been ordering 4 times, on the label it is size M, inside it is size S, but the safety guard was not even removed"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Stylish, warm, but not good for mobility",4,"It looks really nice, is plenty warm. However I find that while the Medium fits me perfect in length and width, I cannot lift my arms over my head or straight in front without the jacket binding up pretty hard -- the jacket's more ""for show"", than ""for go."" It's fine if you're just planning on walking or sitting (I prefer it for going downtown to grab lunch, or for neighborhood walks), but if you're going to be in the garage reaching for things, it can be pretty frustrating."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Nice Jacket, runs a size small",5,"jacket ran about a size small. I returned the large and exchanged it for an extra large. It fit much better but was still a little around the shoulders whenever i stretch my arms out. Otherwise the rest of the jacket is excellent. Nice hood, the zip out lining is really nice except for having two zippers that make it a little thick on the front. Overall, about a 4.5."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Absolute garbage,1,"Jacket fit fairly well. Was snug, but not too tight by any means.After washing it, however, I went to reach for something across the table and the stitches across the back of the right shoulder came loose. Two of them popped and the surrounding stitches are loose enough to pull them out.Not the quality at all I'd expect from Levi."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Very nice jacket, but...",5,"My husband's jackets and coats always have sleeves that are too short. He wears a 2X T-shirt so I bought him a big and tall 2X jacket. It was soooo way too big! I had ordered the khaki and received the olive. In the end, they didn't have another jacket in a 1X big and tall in this brand this style. I ended up ordering a different brand."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Fit great unless you want to use your arms.,3,"I have almost always worn Levi’s jackets, so I thought ordering online would be fine.  This particular jacket however had almost no range of motion in the arms (even though it felt great with arms down).  If I raised my arms to a typing position it pulled on the back really bad (even though shoulders felt fine). Even after unzipping jacket it was as if the arms of the jacket were tied to the middle of the back.  I almost always wear a Large Levi’s jacket, and even wear a slightly tight medium leather motorcycle jacket when riding and it has more arm movement.  I don’t think a larger version would help the way the arms pull on the body unless I just got an oddly sewn one."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Well made but sleeve to back is too tight for average.,3,"The plus side: Excellent pile, length covers kidney and lower spine excellent, very warm. Pockets okay. Snaps excellent, zipper does not look quality.The down side: I am medium person, 5'9"" and 175 lbs, ordered an X-large. The underarm stretch area too tight for a work coat. Fine for standing around/visit. Not good for working with tools, stretching to reach, bending, etc. Price too high, lack workmanship, but good material quality."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Good jacket,4,"Good jacket. I was pumped about getting it. I am  5’10”, round about 175 lbs. a wear a medium in almost anything. The medium fits well and comes to a desired length at my waist. If I raise my arms or stretch them outward in front of me, it gets a little tight in the shoulders. I think a large would be too big. Overall a very nice jacket."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,great fitting jacket,5,"I was looking for a mid-weight jacket for working outside and this jacket is exactly what I wanted. Not so crazy about the hood, but it is removable. I am 5'4"" and 150 lbs and the small fits perfectly, enough room for a layer or two on those colder days.  Great Levis jacket, seems well made, only time will tell how durable it is. Glad I purchased it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Sleeve Size Issue,4,"I am a female but I love the style of this jacket. In men's t-shirts, I wear a size large. I ended up trying on these jackets at a store and the size small was good for me. The large was far too big, so I recommend taking the size into account.I noticed another thing when I tried on all the different sizes: the sleeve sizes don't change. It's the same sleeve on all of them, so unfortunately if your arms are too big, going up a size won't help you."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great cold weather jacket,4,"Looks good, goes down a little past the waistline, fits great in the stomach/chest but it can be a little tight on the shoulders when trying to move certain ways.Plenty of pockets, hood is very comfortable and stays on even in the wind.Dark Brown color i got has weathered nicely through rain/snow and multiple washes."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Little Big,4,"I'm 5' 11"" 180lbs. Average build. Purchased large.The large sits nice at waist, but it is big in the chest and waist. A medium would fit nice, but it could be short in length and sit too high.It is definitely warmer than expected. I was looking for a jean jacket w/hood to wear on those chillier upper 40's/low 50's Northeast days."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Good light winter jacket,4,I needed a good winter jacket and so far I like this one.  I do wish however that the fleece lining extended down the sleeves.  I find this jacket keeps my core really warm; but the arms need a little more insulation.  Still a pretty good jacket though.  I did find the zippers to be a little difficult at first but they seem to have loosened up a little so they zip easier now.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Looks good. No hoodie.,4,"The hood is removable but it's just a hood, not a full hoodie. I was under the impression that a full hoodie was removable. It's just two strips with a hood on it. Otherwise it's good looking. Some loose strings here and there. I can tell the quality is not quite up to par but I expect that from Levi's brand."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Durable Warm Jacket,5,"Levi’s provides a very durable and warm jacket. I’m 6’3 215 lbs. athletic adult male and a X-Large is the perfect fit. This jacket will keep you warm in chilly weather. My friends asked me where they could get one, it’s that nice looking. Very happy my purchase"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Super warm comfy coat,5,"I love this jacket, it’s my go to on cold days. Great for spending the day outside we’re just walking the dog. If it gets a little warmer you can just keep the hoodie zippered.  I do need to take it off in the store, as I do get hot with it. But I guess that’s a sign that it works."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Fits great, more wrinkled look than the pics seem.",5,"This review comes before I use it for the winter. I’ll update it once this jacket gets some frequent use. Having just received it the medium size fits great for me (165 lbs, 6 ft talk, athletic build) and I like the look a lot. Definitely feels warm, like it would stand up to some temperatures up to 32 degrees by itself but once again I’ll update this review when the cold weather comes rolling through.EDIT: Guess I forgot to come back. Works well in the winter, once you get to 30 and below though you better bundle up underneath."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,The perfect jacket,5,"As soon as I bought this I was getting compliments. Very stylish, lots of pockets which are useful and the trend. It's heavy which indicates how warm it is...and if it's frigid outside you can remove the hoody and wear a real one or something similar underneath and still look cool instead of looking like the kid from ""A Christmas Story"". 5'9"", 155 lbs and the small fits perfect"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Small felt more like Medium,4,"I love the style and materials, it's a very cool looking jacket.  But the arms are longer than my other jackets/shirts.  I ordered a small which fit me everywhere but the arms (and I hate rolling them up), so I exchanged it for an XS and the arms fit perfect but now the shoulder area is a bit tight...since it's made of cotton it'll probably stretch a little bit though."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Love it,5,Such a good jacket. Fit is great. Keeps me warm. Looks very nice. My only wish that I would’ve been a bit longer in length but I’m still very satisfied.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Looks great but the quality isn’t ideal.,2,"I purchased this for my husband as a gift. It fits well, looks great and is warm however the quality isn’t great. He had it 2 weeks before there was a hole in the shoulder and then another week before the stitching opened near the pocket. I’ve purchased another coat in a different color somewhere else and it did the exact same thing."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great Jacket!,5,"I love the jacket. Of course the color is not as described but if you look carefully at the tag it says that the color may change over time because of the dye they used. I actually don't mind the color at all. I bought the Kaki Medium. What I do mind was the size is a little big, but I tried on the small in a store and it was too tight, so I had to make do with a medium. There's so many pockets in the jacket, which is awesome! Also the hoodie is a nice feature. The padding for the inside is the best part, because you don't get hot in a store as easily compared to North Face jackets. Plus I get so many compliments wherein this!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Listen to the sleeve reviews,3,"I'm 5'5"", so small appeals to me. Sadly, I should've listened to the review that said sleeve lengths are all the same for each size. It didn't register in my brain that it could mean it's kinda long. Wonderful jacket, very heavy and comfortable, and almost acts like two jackets, given the two zippers for both the removable hoodie and outer shell. Sadly, I look like a kid playing cowboy with the sleeves leaving only half my fingers hanging out. I'll drop off the return tomorrow."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Comfy Jacket,5,Yeah its a bit big around the waist. I have a shoulder span 4 inches bigger than most people. So a big waist area is an ok trade for an all around fit that doesn't feel restrictive. The quality seems good so far. I would probably try a couple sizes if you feel you will be difficult to fit then return the one that doesn't fit.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Not bad, small flaw, love it all the same",4,"Bought this jacket expecting it to be much lighter, but its very thick, but very comfortable.  As a tall man (6'6'') it fits very well, but not as tall as I'd like, but if anyone's out there combing the reviews for this information there ya go.Only big problem was one of the pockets tore at the seems slightly, but I just sewed it back myself."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Very nice. Accurate sizing,5,Great looking jacket. Was the look I was seeking out. Good for the colder temps in my part of the US. A little tight in the shoulders but not enough to make me dislike the jacket.Pleased with the purchase. I’m 6ft and 194 lbs and the large is a good fit.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Deceiving color, but fits nicely.",4,"The Khaki color I received does not match the picture. I dont mind it, but I was not happy at first when I first opened it. It came in an open bag so I assume it had been tried on by someone else and returned. I also received a small instead of a medium. The sleeve tag says medium but the neck tag says small. I will be returning this one and hopefully getting one correctly sized. I will update my review if I get one appropriately sized.Edit: I initially reviewed this product at 2 stars, but I got one appropriately sized after ordering another and it fits pretty well. All the pockets are stitched properly with no holes or imperfections. I cant wait to wear this next fall!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Love this Jacket,5,"I love this jacket.  I have a 22 year old Arizona jacket nearly identical.  As you can imagine it is rather worn, and so I bought this as a replacement since Arizona no longer makes them.  Very comfortable and warm."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Class, style and comfort.",5,It's great! It's just exactly the kind of jacket my husband needs and wants and he looks great in it.It looks and fits just like we likeIT LOOKS AMD JUDT LIKE WE WOULD WANT  A LEVI TO LOOK LIKE!THANK YOU!.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Nice Jacket,5,"This is a very nice jacket--have worn it all winter --& expect to remove liner & wear it when weather's a little warmer, too.  The only thing I would change is the liner & coat zipper: I would make them bigger & heavier."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Feel good,5,I bought this as a warm morning work jacket.. their colors are off because I had to send the first one back when I ordered khaki and got green.. for my second option I went with brown.. it’s not perfect but it’s closer..
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great jacket...but,5,I bought this jacket in November and love the fit and warmthI'm 6 foot and 215 lbsBending to reach something the sleeve ripped.UghThis is not what should happen 3 months after buying a jacketI hope they exchange it
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Excellent jacket at a great price!,5,"Ordered because I got a new GF and lost my old jacket as expected. Got this since it looked rugged and had a hood, was impressed at it in person. Tag said $200 so the price was excellent and I can see this being my winter coat for years."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"A well made, well fitting jacket",5,"Being 6'6"" its hard to find clothes that fit. I was surprised at the fit and quality of this jacket. It is really warm with the liner in and good for the fall with it out. Glad I bought it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Love this jacket,5,"This was better than I expected, I’m 5’9 187lbs and large fits me perfectly. Highly recommended as this is my go to jacket now with colder weather but not the sub freezing. Good from 30 degrees and up. And the color olive looks great"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Ruggedly Handsome,5,"It was time for a new coat for my husband and he wanted something that felt durable. He loves this coat. Said it fits better than expected. It's very cozy. The hood zips off, but he may never remove it. Perfect for autumn and winter walks with the dogs."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"This jacket is very nice, looking, fitting and it is comfortable.",5,"The jacket is perfect for my picky teen boy. He wanted the black one because he prefers to look more put together but still casual. The hood zips out which he likes. It goes well with jeans as well as nicer casual clothing. Its a good medium weight and very versatile. Fits very nicely. It is a good quality, nicely constructed jacket."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Excellent, quality garment",5,Good quality coat. Has removable inside insulation layer and attached hood for a lighter jacket. With inside insulation layer attached should be warm and comfortable for temperatures at and a little below freezing. Very much pleased with the fit and also the cost is very reasonable for this style jacket.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,I LOVE THIS JACKET,5,"I saw this jacket in Kohl's one day but decided against it. Then I picked up a faux leather version in JCP at a ridiculous price (low) but returned it after Googling the item number and found the denim version online. I LOVE THIS JACKET. Its warm, comfortable and fits me very well. I have a large - I am 6 foot tall and 198 pounds and it fits just right. Love the removable hood and all of the pockets. The ONLY thing I would say is that the khaki color online is lighter than what you will get but I still love it. Its casual but you can dress it up too."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Perfect fit!,5,This is an amazing jacket!  I’ve owned it for 4 months now and have put it through the wringer! I will be buying another very shortly.I am 6’1” average build and a large fits perfectly in all areas.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,1/2 size too small,4,"I wear a 2x size shirt and jacket. NO problems at. THIS is about 1/2 size too small. Zipper is a pain in the ass. It's on the snug side. Has built in sweatshirt. Definitely NOT for sub zero temps. Good for average winter temps..  Main complaint,too snug,at least it has snaps in case zipper doesn't work right."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great jackets but I believe amazon is selling seconds.,3,These are great jackets but I believe amazon is selling seconds? I’ve tried these on in stores and the fit is the same but quality isn’t. Lots of reviews talk about returning the jacket and I thought about returning mine but I chose to keep it. The zipper wasn’t sown in completely on one side and one of the snaps on the front of the jacket won’t snap. I took the jacket and paid to have the zipper sown in and fixed. If you order it really inspect it once it arrives.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great Jacket,5,Jacket is excellent.  Had trouble finding my size and had to order it through AmazonJacket arrived as promised and it is excellent.  Zipper lining and hood.This is the second one we purchased.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Favorite Levi's Jacket,5,"I got this jacket for the winter and it totally works its purpose. Actually it is coziest than I think when I bought it;  the jacket design is casual and looks cool.  I am very satisfied with the product and the seller. There was no any sign of ripped fibbers, all buttons are firmly attached and feel durable.  The zipper went all the way up and down, zero zipper stuck problems; all in all zero problems .Package was delivered on time and with its original Levi's tags. I totally recommend this jacket and the seller."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Better than I hoped for!,5,"From other, mostly positive reviews, there were a few that mentioned tight shoulders, stiffness, and zipper issues. I found none of them!It fit perfectly and has a broken-in feel. Looks nice and well made. I’m happy with it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Couldn't afford any more but needed a good coat. This is a GREAT one,5,"I paid 41 dollars for this thru a special here, after reading the reviews. Couldn't afford any more but needed a good coat. This is a GREAT one! Love it, styling, high quality sewn, top quality materials and it keeps my paralyzed body WARM out in the below freezing temps. No more teeth chattering shakes. BTW, the tags on the sleeve say 189 dollars. I'm 6'2"" and weigh 125 lbs with long arms and it fits great, as stated above, my body is a small build but this would fit the heavy folks out there, I expect a bigger fit because of my size, comfortable with it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Our son loves it.,5,"This is a great jacket.  It has so many variations, such as the fact that you can zip up the hoodie part but leave the jacket unzipped.  But then you can zip up the jacket.  And if it's really cold you can button the front of the jacket too.  Or, you can zip out the hoodie.  Our son loves it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Surprising Quality and Great Fit,5,"This is a high quality jacket at a very decent price.  Looks great.  I am 5'11"" and 190 lbs. and I purchased a large size - fits perfectly with extra room for layering."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Fits and its warmth,5,"Fits well even with a mid sweatshirt or hoodie under, it has pockets on the side and two buttonpockets and it has 2 chest pockets and one one inside the chest. The hoodie is removable (it's just the grey lining on the jacket, and its held in place with a zipper. Feels warm in 40° weather. Doing some lite activity it's a 3 star for me but that might be because the jacket wasn't broken in yet ... maybe."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Order your normal size,5,After reading the reviews i ordered a size up and got a 3X Tall. I'm 6'2 and weigh 275. The 3X was huge on me so ive ordered a 2X which should fit much better. The overall quality of the jacket is great just stick with what size you normally wear.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Rivits rough at wrist and great fit,5,Great fit and I like it very much. One problem: the rivits on the cuffs are rough and scratch at my wrists. I can't part with the jacket so I'm gonna fix the rivits myself.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Military Jacket, he’ll truly like, and it’s a Levi Strauss & Co. product even better.",5,Birthday Gift to be given in May of this year. Been my experience on some items being sold at a great price as well in his size. Best to buy the item now. For sure you’ll get it not have to worry if the gift is in stock will arrive on time?
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Love the look,5,Our son loves this jacked. He likes that you can zip out the hoodie and the inner lining. Looks and feels great. Our son is 6 foot tall and we got it a bit larger since he likes it that way.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great jacket!,5,"As you can see in the pics, the cords don’t dangle out it’s a nice design so even though it appears to be a rugged look it’ll always have a nice fit.  Happens to be very warm and looks great with jeans.  I’ll also recommend the Levi’s shoes for jeans if you’re trying to complete your look."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"6'6"", 200lbs, Large Tall fits great.",5,"I'm 6'6"", 200lbs, with a 34-36 inseam on my pants, so I have a lot of trouble finding shirts and jackets that fit. This one is pretty good though.I got the Large Tall and I love it. It's a little roomy, but not big enough for me to mind. I could probably wear a sweater underneath but it would be tight. It's pretty warm too. I spent a week at a cabin in the mountains, with a lot of fresh snow, and this kept me warm enough with just gloves. Not waterproof though, you'll have to do that yourself. Best fitting jacket I own. As in the picture t's not a tight fit, but it's not baggy either, very comfy."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Cool, reasonable price",5,"Like most Levis jackets, this runs small and I suggest you order a size up.  They are sized for 'young men' while i am an old coot.  Khaki color is indeed an army olive, just be aware, it's exactly what i wanted. You can get the same effect by buying an M65 field jacket (Rothco) and wearing a hoodie underneath, but still."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Just PERFECT!!!!,5,Has an inside pocket.  2 zippers as the gray jacket part also zips up. He wears a L shirt so i bought an XL to fit loosely at the armpits being its Denim.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,GREAT JACKET,5,I AM 5FT9 AND 185 LBS. I ORDERED A LARGE AND IT WAS A LITTLE SMALL. THIS IS WITH AN UNDER SHIRT AND AN  LL BEAN LONG SLEEVE SHIRT. I ORDERED AN XL AND IT FIT FINE.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Fit is great, quality is lacking",3,"While I'm excited to have finally found a jacket that fits my husband's long arms, I'm disappointed by the quality. There's a huge hole in the inner pocket lining."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Gift for Hubs,5,Got this as a Christmas gift for husband.  Love this coat.  Great casual coat.  Warm but not too hot.  My husband doesn't like heavy layers and this is perfect.  Not as heavy in the sleeves but warm through the body.  Great color options.  We would definitely recommend.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Enjoy the Fall in Style,5,"I bought this as an early holidy gift for my adult son, who didn't own a fall jacket.  It was either a light sweatshirt or a down jacket.He loves it!  It is perfect for temperatures in the 40s - 60s.And the price on Amazon was so much less than other supposed discount department stores."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Better than Expected,5,"This was better than what my husband expected. Fits well, is very comfortable and warm. He does a lot of rugged outdoor work. This jacket is perfect. Good price."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Nice coat!,5,I purchased this coat for my son.  He likes Levi products because of their durability.  He like that you can unzip the hoody if you just want it to look like a jacket.  He said it is very warm and comfortable!  Great buy.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,ES UNA GRAN COMPRA PERO,5,ES MUY BUEN PRODUCTO PERO ES DEMASIADO BROMOSO Y PESADO.ES SUMAMENTE GRUESANO LA PODRÉ USAR MUCHO PORQUE NO ES PARA EL CLIMA MEXICANO.TIENE BORREGA EN SU INTERIOR (Y ESO NO SE VE EN LAS FOTOS DE COMPRA) Y LA HACE SUMAMENTE PESADA Y MUY RÍGIDA. NO ME SIENTO CÓMODO CON ELLA
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Perfect jacket,5,Incredible jacket. My son is away at college in CT and it’s keeping him warm. It looks great and he actually wears it!
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"This is a great jacket. However - the ""hoodie"" isn't actually a ...",5,"This is a great jacket. However - the ""hoodie"" isn't actually a separate garment, it's a removable hood that's meant to look like you're wearing a grey hoodie underneath. I think they could have gone without it completely and the jacket would be even better - but it's not a big deal, it unzips easily and the jacket still looks great with an actual hoodie underneath."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,ACEPTABLE,4,"NO ERA LO QUE ESPERABA Y ME QUEDO UN POCO MAS GRANDE QUE LA MISMA TALLA DE LA MISMA MARCA, ASI QUE NO CREO QUE LO USE POR ESTA EPOCA!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Worth it,5,Definitely kind of short proportionally (lengthwise) for a Medium size if you're taller than 5'9. Otherwise AWESOME WARM jacket. Second I bought in 7 years and still love/use my old one!

Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Levi's Hooded Jacket Review,5,"This hooded jacket was WELL WORTH THE MONEY! I have other jackets that are similar but none are as well made or warm. The quality of the material is excellent, the fit is just right, and the price was just as excellent too. Extremely warm and comfortable to wear and comparable to any Carhartts jacket I've ever had. Very well worth the money. I LOVE this jacket and will definitely be ordering another soon."

It is a bit in the heavy side but it's no issue for me. Arm length is also perfect not too Long or to Short. It has plenty of pockets to store things very deep inside jacket pocket for your wallet, cell or passport."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Thumbs Up,5,"I already had a jacket like this one and brought this to replace my old Levi. Love it. Just what I expected. A little pricey, but Great Jacket"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Inside pocket,5,"I bought this for the size of the inside pocket, needs to be able to carry more than just a small cellphone, this pocket holds my phone while in it's M11 controller. Huawei mate 30 pro so it's a good size."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Good buy,5,"I'm a big guy, 6'5"" and 280. Clothes are not easy to come by. Was looking for a jacket that keeps me warm, fits my enormity, and looks good on a blue collared man without being mistaken for ironic hipster stuff. I like this jacket, and it feels like it will last for several decades no problem. Plenty warm, the pockets are pretty handy, and it seems to be a sound investment."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Why are Levi sizes always off?,2,"I am fit, 6' tall. That being said Levi shirts run small, coats run large, jean jackets run extremely narrow. What's up with the sizing? I was very excited for the coat and  am basically swimming in size M."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great Quality Multiple Options,5,This is a great quality jacket. This is another recommendation from Jen Reed ( Instagram: sister studio) I am getting it for someone at Christmas time. They never wear coats but this quality is amazing and it is so heavy and thick for colder days. Not disappointed at all with the quality
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Well-made but way too short,4,"Itsca nice jacket. Warm, has a hoodie that is very useful but it's way too short. To the extent when you dont even have to lean forward to get your lower back fully exposed which is suboptimal when its chilly outside"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Go with one size smaller than you normally would wear,5,"I'm 5'10"" 180lbs and the medium fits perfectly. Based on my chest size, the chart said I should have large, but having worn the medium I think I would have been swimming in the large, and the sleeves would have been way too long.Material seems very durable, and the style is pretty bad ass. I'm very happy with this jacket."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Warm and versatile,5,"I haven't tried the coat without the lining yet (zips out) but is very warm for 10°F winter weather. Good value for the price. (original unit shipped was tagged XL (which I ordered) on the sleeve, but the collar tag was XXL and it was way to big. I returned it to Amazon and received a replacement within 3 days - great service :)"

Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Very Nice Value and Fit,4,"Nice, rugged, casual coat. Body has cloth  lining but not the sleeves. Hoodie is just part of a grey lapel piece which is removable by zipper. Seems like it would be warm to 32 degrees, more with a full hoodie or sweatshirt. I am just over 6 feet, 180, size XL is great. Recommended for a relatively inexpensive coat."

Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great Jacket- fits a little tight,5,"It's a really nice jacket....was glad I got it on sale. It appears to be rugged and well made....definitely warm. I bought a medium because that's what I wear. It is a little snug around the shoulders. If I had it over to do, I would buy the large. I would recommend that if you wear a medium shirt, buy this jacket in a large."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,... of these in the same size at Kohls and liked it so much I bought a second on Amazon ...,3,I bought one of these in the same size at Kohls and liked it so much I bought a second on Amazon at the same size but in a different color. The one I got from Amazon seems to fit a nudge too snugly and even the pockets seem shallower. I'm wondering if the fabric shrunk in warehouse storage somewhere or if there's just some issue with consistency/quality-control.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great coat,5,Son loves this jacket so much so we got 2 in different colors.

Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,You'll Be Happy!,5,"Updated review: jacket continues to give outstanding service as the warmest short jacket I own.  I accidentally tore it on a door handle and ordered its replacement the same day.Good quality, excellent fit and finish.  Sturdy denim and soft and warm yet compact lining.  Hood comes out easily and in my case will likely never see the light of day again.  I'm very happy!"

Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Just in time,5,"Loved the jacket, material is not what I expected because as soon as you wash it the color fades slowly.

Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Sized wrong,2,"The quality of the jacket was good, but the sizing was wrong.  The fit was more like an x-regular than a xx-tall.  Very disappointed."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great winter Coat.,5,I bought this jacket because i had the same jacket and I really liked it. The zipper is no longer the heavy duty type zipper though. Afraid its just a matter of time before it breaks. Otherwise its very warm and a great winter (IN NJ) jacket.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Not made for people with a long torso or arms,3,The XL run a little small since I'm all arm and torso. The arms were short and the length wasn't exactly to the belt even though I followed there sizing chart. If you can fit though it's a solid jacket made out of quality material
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Simply a solid jacket,4,This jacket was purchased to replace a Walmart special Faded Glory jacket. It is comprable in just about every way. Except my pockets used to be big enough to fit my hand with gloves on.  The Levi pockets aren't even big enough to fit the gloves alone.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Nice jacket.,4,"A little darker than in the picture, but I like it.  Ordered the Khaki and had to double check when I received it.  Has a military green/light olive tint to it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Well done, very rugged construction",5,"I found this was a heavier jacket, but this was most likely due to the way it was constructed. It is very well put together, very happy with it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Nice jacket,5,Very well made. My son likes it. It looks good true color description and size chart
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Fit and comfort,4,"pleased with this purchase, the only criticism the sleeves are a little short."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great Looking jacket...Fit is a little too big,4,"Style:  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Comfort: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Sizing:  ⭐⭐⭐ (I'm 5'8"" & 150-160 lbs.)I probably should have purchased a M but the Large isn't so big, that I'm thinking of returning it.Jacket is very comfortable & perfect for cold winter weather (with hoodie.) And the outer jacket, (w/out hoodie) is perfect for Spring/Fall weather."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great jacket!,5,Got this for my husband for Christmas on a whim.  He loves it!  It fits great and is a good casual option.  I only wish they made the same jacket in boys sizes for our sons.  They love dad’s jacket and want one too.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Fits right at belt.,5,"Bought as a gift for a friend. Fits great, looks great, and he likes it. Good but for sure"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great jacket,5,Bought it as a Christmas gift for my husband. He loved it and wears it all of the time. He especially loved that the hoodie was removable. True to size and warm.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Great quality, fit, and function",5,"I love this jacket. I thought the lining would be removable, but it's great for maintaining warmth in different climates."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Incorrect Sizing,2,"The product quality is as expected although i received the incorrect size.  I ordered an XL. It seemed large so I had my son try it on and it is really oversized!! Although the tags attached to the jacket say the correct XL size, the actual tag inside the jacket states it's actually a 3XL. Of course I missed the return window and am now stuck with a brand new item that cannot be used."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Good jacket for the money,5,For the money it’s a really really nice jacket it’s good Levi’s quality and the other bonuses you can unzip the hoodie part out of it
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"two thumbs up, but some things to note",5,"I found this jacket looking to replace an old Carhartt jacket of mine. I ordered a similar jacket from Carhartt, and was unsatisfied with he fit when I found this one and I love it. Its perfect for casual wear, and isn't too heavy to wear on a daily basis. The wind and rain doesn't cut through and there is space for layers underneath. The inner liner is like a fluffy wool, and is super warm and the rest of the coat is well stitched and put together. Granted, I live in GA so that only means its great in weather from 20-50 degrees; much colder than that and this may not be your coat. You don't even have to order a size up or down, I'm 5'11 and 165 lbs and ordered a medium and it fits perfect. I took the hood out of mine (it looked a little juvenile to me) but the material it's made of is super soft as well.The only heads up I would give someone ordering this jacket is that the true color of the jacket doesn't seem to be what is pictured on the listing. I read reviews saying the khaki was much darker than pictured, and I decided to order the black one (pictured as a dusky grey) only to find it was jet black. Not a huge deal to me, it will probably fade in the wash anyway but just keep that in mind. Otherwise I love it, two thumbs up."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"It's great for around town,  not a work jacket unless you size up.",4,Fits a little snug if you are working in it but looks fantastic on hubby otherwise! Just about 3 inches below belt.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Look great on my boyfriend!,5,Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and it looks sooo hot!! I went one size up so he can put this on over layers (it gets cold here in Northern California) perfect fit. He’s a tall guy so I was worried this would be short but it wasn’t.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Heavy quality, nice details",5,"Bought this for my son for Christmas. Just came in today. Not sure about the fit yet but it looks true to size. Good quality. Nice details.The sherpa is a firm, heavy material, the sleeves aren’t lined with sherpa."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Wow that was fast,5,I literally got my order in a day! Great quality and like I said Fast Delivery!!!
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Wonderful jacket,5,"The fit is great, and it is simple yet has a really nice look. The faux sherpa lining makes it pretty warm. Depending on the weather this year it might even hold up in the winter cold, look forward to trying!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Wear in a variety of settings.,5,"Love this classic military jacket. I wear it hiking and to work. It wears well, always looks good with whatever I wear."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Chinese quality, you can buy if you have a seamstress at home.",3,"The color did not match the picture. There is beige, Amazon shipping a light olive. Everywhere sticking thread. The hole in the right inner pocket, it just is not sewn up. Guided by previous reviews, i realized that the buttons are fragile and used it very very carefully. And so ... on the second day one fell apart, what next?""Thank you very much"" Amazon.Now a little about the positive :) The jacket is comfortable and very warm, good for the off-season. The buttons are flimsy, but the zipper is good, you can only use it.Good luck to all."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Do Not Buy!!!,1,Gave as a Christmas gift & the arm ripped out on January 31.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,sizing chart,4,"i like the coat, be careful with sizing chart, followed chart instructions exactly, coat is a little big got xxlarge could have gone with xlarge since it is cotton material when it is washed it will most likley shrink and fit ."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Great quality, good fit, as warm as they get!",5,"This fashionable coat from Levi's is both great to look at and great to wear! Amazon has the best selection of colors and the best price on this coat, Get one!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Worth it,5,Super comfortable and durable
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,I really liked the look of the Jacket,4,"I'm 6'2"" 280, and wear a 2XL shirt, which is sometimes a bit too small, depending on brand.  I bought the 2X/Tall, and found it was way too big in the torso, basically cut for a guy with a gut, and too long for a jacket, getting into coat length.  For a tall size I was surprised to find the sleeves a little short for my 36/37 - 37/38 sleeve length.All that aside, I really liked the look of the Jacket, the olive color was pretty much perfect.  The removable hoodie was interesting, not really something I would keep in, and a bit light in color for the olive."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Fits big,4,"I wear a small levis denim jacket, and it's tight on me, so I figured the small would be good, but it was huge on me, so I ordered the xs which fits better but is still a little baggy.It doesn't feel like it would be very warm when you put it on, but it keeps the cold out pretty well."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Jacket is green,4,Got as gift for the hubs. He has worn it to work.  I think he likes it.He said that he likes it.He looks cute wearing it.My hubs is cute.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Easy exchange to get the correct fit.,5,It was easy to send back the Large size and the reorder the X-Large which was receives quickly in 3 days. Very happy.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Nice jacket,5,A little heavier than I expected but really nice.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,amazing jacket,5,"After my previous jacket was torn up at the elbows, I decided to get this one, and not only is it stylish and comfy, it's also great for insulating heat during the winter, and you can take out the inside so it's technically two jackets in one."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great jacket.,5,"I never liked a jacket as much as this. Very warm, has a great feel to it, looks awesome. I anxiously took it out of the box and was so excited at how good it looked and felt. I always look forward to wearing it and even feel more manly so to speak as it has the look and feel of ruggedness. Best jacket I ever bought."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Very nice jacket,5,"Great jacket, very stylish. Jacket is for extremely cold weather as a heads up though so if you live in Southern California you’ll be way to hot"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Great look, comfortable fit",5,My son saw this jacket at kohl’s for $79 so pleased to find exactly the same jacket for almost $20 cheaper. Fits great
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great Jacket for the Price,5,Great quality and love that the grey “hoodie” parts can be removed. Warm and comfortable
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great jacket for all weather,5,"I really like this jacket. It can be used in a variety of temps, thanks to the removable hoody. Lots of pocket room and is made of durable material. I went one size up from what I usually wear after reading other reviews and it fits almost perfectly. I am six foot three and about 170 pounds and got a large."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Love this warm jacket,5,This jacket fit me without squeezing me or binding my shoulders. Seller got it to me when and how they stated they would.
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"good jacket, minor problems",4,"This a good warm jacket.  At 49 dollars, it is a good price.  Not perfect tho, there is a hole in the pocket that I will just fix, also the denim is a bit thin, but that it standard these days."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,So warm!,5,This thing will keep you very warm and I love the fact that the hood can  come out with a quick zip of a zipper  if you’re looking for a stylist coat that I actually keep you warm this is the correct coat for you
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Buy 2 More - Love This Coat,5,"Far exceeded my expectations. Looks great, awesome LEVI quality."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Well made coat,5,This coat is well-made. It's a plus to have a removable liner making this coat usable not only in the fall but into the winter
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,3xlt for heavy set.,5,"I bought this for my brother who is heavy set with a big belly and the 3xlt fit just fine. He is about 5'10"" 280ish if that helps anyone."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,"Good looking jacket, bought for the Goretex!",4,"I bought this jacket because of its Goretex fabric.  Have not used it yet in the rain, but I purchased a large to be able to use this jacket as a winter shell, and wear a thin down sweater underneath this jacket.  Fit is perfect for that.  As a comparison, I have a Marmot Knife Edge jacket in Medium, and that fits great, with just a long sleeve t-shirt underneath.  I could not wear anything thicker with the Medium.For the price, this jacket is a good value(I paid around $100 for warehouse like new)"
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,A really great jacket.,5,"This to me is the perfect outer layer. I’ve worn it in the winter’s snowy cold and wind. I wear an Xl. It fits just right. I wear a base layer, shirt and down vest. It keeps me warm and dry. It keeps the rain out. The zipper never jams. The hood fits nicely. The simple Velcro straps on the wrists are easy to use, even while wearing gloves. This jacket is very light and quite packable.  I highly recommend it."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,cut is a little slim around the belly,4,"This is a very nice jacket. Breathable and waterproof. The fabric feels premium.The cut is large in the shoulders yet a bit trim around the midsection.  The Marmot Precip has more of a generous cut around the middle.  I was expecting similar tailoring from this jacket, but not so.It's a really nice jacket, but if you've got some extra padding around your midsection, it's a little snug.Also the breast pocket is on the right side, not the best solution if you are right-handed."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Nice jacket,4,Nice jacket but wish it were a little longer.  For taller people it rides up in back while riding a bicycle and water gets into the rain pants.
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,"Great for light-medium rain, good for heavy rain conditions",4,"- For the weight, it is one of the best in class waterproof jacket.- For warmth, additional layer under it would be sufficient.- Sizing is accurate.- Marmoot usually prices its products higher than their worth, that is why I got 4 stars."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Pocket on wrong side,5,Second one I've own. Wish the breast pocket was on the left side so it's easier to use with right hand like my older model. Everything else is excellent.
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,"Lightweight, comfortable, cool, and completely waterproof!!",5,"Lightweight, comfortable, cool, and completely waterproof!!"
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,light weight and wind proof,4,Great jacket its very wind proof but is NOT 100% water proof. Good for light rain but not a down pour. use as a shell for hiking
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Slim fit,4,I'm about 42-44 for jacket size. The coat fits slim with a tee shirt and flannel layer underneath. I've got to send it back for XL because I may want to wear a fleece or puffer jacket underneath.
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Beautifully Minimalist,5,Simplicity in design yet technologically advanced. This jacket just looks good and has a lot of well thought out details. Stuff it in a pack and go on a hike. Zip it up to walk the dog in a downpour. Layer under it and take it on on a snowy commute. It can do all that and like all Marmot gear it does everything in style.
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Excelente para invierno!!!,5,Muy buena para andar en moto!! La lluvia no es inconveniente!!
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Cozy,5,"Best jacket I’ve ever owned. Finally got it out in the mountain. A squall rolled through. Rugged, lightweight, watertight, breathable. I’m in heaven!"
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,It is nice and light but also well made,5,It arrived quickly. My husband is incredibly pleased with the weight and fit. Perfect Spring coat for changeable weather.

MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Excellent Rain Jacket,5,Excellent
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,love it,5,Love it.  Light weight and stylish
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Was looking for a lighter jacket that I could use in less harsh conditions - for that I have a ME Lhotse jacket, but that's OTT for dog walking and summer coastal path showers etc. Narrowed search down to a small number from Marmot, Patagonia, Berghaus and Mountain Equipment; all made with GTX paclite fabric. Ultimately it came down to price and availability, plus the Marmot consistently does well in reviews, both consumer and expert.So, I've had the jacket for a few days, spent about 4-5 hours outdoors in typical West wales weather of high winds and pouring rain, including the brunt of storm Christoph. First observation is that the material doesn't leak, so there are no faults with the seams of the membrane. One source of leaks is likely to the zips, both the main and the pockets, as they are not water resistant / water tight, buit the storm flaps that protect them seem to do a great job, although I always put my phone in a plastic bag, there was no sign of dampness after a a couple of hours in driving rain.The hood is excellent, I was sceptical that the single toggle design would be as effective as the older style, but it is, although it's as fiddly as hell to adjust with bare hands, let alone with gloves on, so best done before you go out. Once you've set it though, it's really good, not as well designed or as effective as the Lhotse, but you wouldn't expect that.Sizing is true to what I would normally buy, the length is adequate, arm length is fine, cuffs fit well with enough space to overlap a pair of thick gloves.Haven't tried it on hilly terrain yet, so don't know how breathable it really is, but that's generally a myth anyway, if you're working up a sweat, you will get damp inside no matter how good the material is.In summary:Pros- Good fit- Quality of construction, no leaks- Hood fitting- Lightweight and packable- Reasonable price for paclite GTX jacket- Napolean pocketCons- Fiddly hood adjustment- Zips not water resistant (though they haven't leaked)"
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"I have not used this jacket for long enough to comment on its durability.  It is lightweight and wind proof and the sizing is correct, although the sleeves are long - not necessarily a bad thing.  However in all my 70 years plus I have never been sold a cardigan, fleece, jacket, deep-sea oilies or even life jackets with left hand zips.  This jacket is supplied with the tongue of the zip on the left, which means you have to use your left hand to insert the tongue into the zipper.  Furthermore, the single breast pocket is on the right chest with the zipped opening facing the centre.  Again, the left hand has to be used to open the pocket and retrieve the contents. Fine if you are left handed, but most of us are right handed and you may find the design odd, and possibly irritating.  Nothing wrong with catering for left handed people, but there should be an option, and the odd feature should be made clear."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"This would have been my 3rd Marmot jacket, this one to replace a lightweight shell that's donkey's years old.  My other is a Solaris winter jacket.  The body length on the Minimalist is fairly short - 2in shorter than the Solaris and my old shell, meaning it stopped just above my bum, which is too short.  Add in that the sleeves are fairly long, and very wide, and it wanted to crease across the chest, and it all added up to a jacket that just looked odd when wearing.  Normally Marmots are a great fit which is what made this all the more disappointing."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"This is one of the best Gore Tex Paclite jackets on the market. Ideal for those times when you are not expecting rain but obviously need to carry something just in case. The jacket is lightweight and packs down small, so there is really no excuse not to have a waterproof jacket in your pack.The cut of the jacket is quite short in length, but I prefer this. If you prefer a longer length walking jacket, best look elsewhere. To aid breathability, the jacket has pit zips which are easy to access.Have only used a couple of times in the rain, but has perfomed flawlessly each time."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Smart looking jacket that’s light, totally waterproof so far and effective at blocking wind. I’ve had jackets that claim to be breathable but this is the first one that’s really lived up to the claim. I’ve worn it on a hot, humid, rainy summer day and barely broken a sweat. The zips all have covers and don’t leak. I like the stiff peak on the hood that helps prevent it drooping down over the eyes. I think that at this modest price point, this is a great, lightweight jacket that is very versatile and great value for money."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"I bought this blue Marmot Men's Minimalist Jacket (large) in July 2021. Despite being right-handed, I was comfortable with the left-handed format of this jacket and can live with the removal of the hood-tensioner and 'sealing-button' at the base of jacket compared to the same jacket I purchased 3 years ago (in a slightly darker blue).  However, less acceptable is the quality of the zipping. In particular, the zipping on all parts of the garment looks and feels flimsy/cheap compared to the more robust zipping on my previous jacket and is difficult to operate. A pocket zip has already snagged and the main zip on the front is unnecessarily fiddly to link up (to zip the jacket up), not good for what is meant to be a quality, outdoor jacket. I am not confident that the zipping will last, it looks like something you'd find on a supermarket product. I very much like the style of these minimalist Gortex jackets, but feel that Marmot have let their quality (and image) slip by undertaking what looks like cost-cutting."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"So it is very comfortable and price is similar to other gortex jackets, HOWEVER the main reason you buy this jacket is to have something waterproof and breathable for treks, and it is not waterproof at all, I've got caught on the mountain with a small rain and my jacket absorbed all the water...Will have to return it,"
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Had many so called “waterproof” jackets over the years and so far (only been using it for a few weeks) is has been much better than my expectations. It is a good fit, lightweight and very comfortable. Above all it is waterproof. Been out in a few downpours with no leaks, however only time will tell if this lasts."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Managed to keep the wind and rain out on a very cold fishing trip that was mentioned to be a treat. Ended up with 28mph winds and driving rain. I had plenty of layers on underneath but the jacket did a great job. Very light, easy to pack in a ruckack just in case."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Great quality, smart looking, nothing to fault."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,Great light jacket
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Great coat, keeps me dry in torrential rain"
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,Top quality outdoor kit
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Ja, sie ist wasserdicht. Ja, man kann sie klein zusammenfalten.Ich muss jedoch sagen, dass ich mir unter einer Regenjacke, in der ich trotz Gortex massiv schwitze, für diesen krassen Preis etwas Besseres gewünscht hätte - mehr Jacke, weniger Plane.Keine Kaufempfehlung!"
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Purtroppo rispetto alla versione dello scorso anno, che si trova in molte recensioni online, questa è molto peggiorata, in:-non ha più il bottone in basso, alla fine della cerniera-non ha più le regolazioni laterali al cappuccio ma solo una sul retro (che devo dire funziona abbastanza bene però)-la cerniera centrale è molto più piccola anche se sempre YKK-la tasca sul petto non ha più la cerniera impermeabile ma solo un flap di protezione-la tasca in basso non è più enorme come la precedente ma si ferma a metàPer il resto, è un softshell abbastanza robusto, non super comprimibile ma decisamente protettivo.Tessuto molto buono, piacevole al tatto e il goretex dà una bella sensazione di affidabilità.Peccato per il taglio del torso, piuttosto corto rispetto alle maniche.L'ho confrontato direttamente con il Patagonia Torrentshell 3L: quest'ultimo ha una costruzione superiore e meglio rifinito, il materiale invece mi piace meno, molto plasticoso e rumoroso. Il Marmot è decisamente più piacevole da indossare, anche in situazioni non outdoor, forse grazie alla membrana Goretex.Compratelo attorno ai 120 € come ho fatto io, non vale di più.Se trovate quello vecchio, prendete quello!"
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Gute Regenjacke mit vielen durchdachten Merkmalen. An den Reißverschlüssen sind Zippergaragen,die Unterarmbelüftung hilft gegen Überhitzung.Allein,dass der Hauptreißverschluss ungewohnt für Männer „auf der falschen Seite“ ist,irritiert etwas.Daran gewöhnt man sich jedoch schnell.Die Jacke lässt sich gut in der Kapuze verstauen und ist so klein verpackt jederzeit griffbereit im Rucksack dabei.Bis jetzt hatte ich auch bei stärkerem Regen nirgends Wassereinbrüche,die Nähte sind gut versiegelt.Ich würde sie wieder kaufen."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"This is my favorite for long spring fall wet hikes and whle camping knowing full well its going to rain hard. Seams well sealed, fit and mobility excellent. This newer style has only one waist cinch which I dont like and also one hood side cinch. Not as good as first variant. Long hikes I still like Marmot Precip which is lighter and breaths better ensuring wet summer hikes you dont sweat as much. For spring and fall or really heavy rain though this is the best I can find. Fits normal sizing. I would buy up one size though as this converts well to a 3 layer winter coat when its cold and rainy, with a simple mid layer vest and long sleeve top."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Fue un regalo para un familiar que llevaba tiempo tras ella, y nunca se decidía por su alto precio. En el black friday hubo una oferta y se la compré. Está encantado con ella.Se ha metido bajo la ducha para comprobar si cala, y hemos visto que es totalmente impermeable.De talla va perfecta.Un acierto"
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,Meine Jacke ist weder atmungsaktiv noch wasserdicht - kein guter Kauf nach 2 Monaten im Einsatz. Selbst Nieseltegen überfordert diese Jacke.
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"I’m loving this jacket so far. Great value for a lightweight Gore-Tex rain jacket. Highly recommend. The only negative comment I can make is that it makes a bit of a crinkling sound from the material, but I think most clothing made of Gore-Tex sounds similar."

MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"It's a Marmot just not the version shown in the photo. Jacket seems alright, and does appear on the Marmot website as the minimalist, but it is not the version i watched reviews about which is the pictured jacket.  Apparently known as the minimalist component. Anyway, seems to be the new norm on the 'zon🤔😐"

MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,Looks like a great jacket! I gave one less star for the color; it doesn't reflect the color tone on the product picture. The scotch color is much darker and I must return it as hunters could mistake me for a deer.

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"The listing is a lie, this jacket is only partially cotton lined.",1,"I got this jacket because I wanted a warm flannel lined jacket and I was sick of my current polyester lined jacket.This jacket was listed as 100% cotton lined for both sleeves and body. As you can see from my pictures, that was a lie.Which is too bad, I liked it otherwise.1 star for your lies."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",4,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Ron Swanson,4,"Not a heavy jacket. Good as an outter shell. Currently in use as a 'Shop Jacket'. I've had complements regarding its style. I, however, can not comment on style. This is not part of my skill set. I do however enjoy the feel of this garment as I work in my wood shop. That is all."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,READ REVIEWS...STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP!,1,"I should have read more reviews. The jacket STINKS horribly; by that I mean that it smells/reeks of chemicals, enough to give you a headache!  I have never experienced something like this. It’s a cheap, made in China, POS!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$!!  It fits all kinds of wrong!  It’s huge...long arms...It’s not completely lined. The pictures make it seem that the sleeves are fleece lined; they are not!  On top of everything, I have to pay $7.00 to return!  I spend thousands on Amazon and this is how I’m treated. Ridiculous!  Shame on me for not reading reviews. Live & learn."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Stitching is weak!,1,"This is a warm, good looking shirt jacket.But don’t let the looks fool you!I almost paid to have my logo sewn into it.The stitching is double on the sleeve cuffs, pockets & button placards. But in the places where it receives the most stress it is single stitched from the inside. This allows the armpits to blow out & reveal the crappy construction behind the material. Then the seams by the pockets comes apart. Then the Velcro rips apart the inside pocket.$70 is a lot to pay for a good shirt if it is going to fall apart so quickly!It’s not going to be an easy fix & im pissed off!Can’t bring myself to buy a replacement at these prices with cheap stitching!Wish there was a brand made with quality stitching that had this look & feel!I have been impressed with your brand & have bought many flannel shirts & Henleys.Very surprised you would put such crappy workmanship into a product you sell to be a jacket or outerwear. Which should be more durable than a regular shirt."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Awesome jacket!,5,"I find it hard to find women's jackets that come in the same earthy tones as alot of men's wear, so I ordered this in the small.  Awesome jacket!! Other than the sleeves being obviously huge which I had anticipated, it is a great fit and quality. Perfect insulation, and definitely a great light fall work coat.  Tops!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Much to the dismay of my wife, I hate this jacket...",1,"This may be great for a someone who wants to pretend that they are rugged, but if you are looking for a functional jacket, it totally misses the mark.CONS:1) Thin and lightweight, so it doesn't provide much warmth.2) The flannel lining is nice but thin. Definitely not traditional flannel material.3) Sleeves are not lined with the flannel material, only a silk-like lining (definite sign that this is made for looks, not work.)4) My biggest gripe is the side hand pockets... who in the world thought this position was a good idea? (3 and 9 o'clock positions). You need to reach BEHIND yourself to get your hands into the pockets! Either Legendary Whitetails didn't plan on users using these pockets or they didn't test it before production with real people. Since the pockets are sewn right into the 3-9 seams, I believe they were just lazy.PROS:1) Nice color2) Outer material has seems well-made3) Buttons are awesome4) Chest and internal pockets are greatFINAL THOUGHTS: The side hand pocket issues are a non-negotiable for me. It would never be remotely close to my favorite jacket even with this fixed. If you only want this for a light layer to go out in the evening and have no use for side pockets, then this is the jacket for you! If you are looking at this for use in the shop, the cold, hiking, or tactical, look elsewhere."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,You don't get what you pay for.,1,Jacket looks good. But is really cheaply made. Has zero warmth. No lining in the sleeves at all. And the lining in the rest is minimal at best. The snaps are a joke. They pop open with the slightest movement. The stitching was coming out down the front. And the top pocket and the inside pocket are small small your phone won't fit. Your buying the name and the hype when you buy this overpriced jacket. Looks good but has too many issues to recommend.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Not Really ""Rugged"" But Has Grown On Me",4,"I'm the kind of guy who usually gets my clothes from Goodwill or Walmart, so $80 was a big spend from me and I had pretty high expectations. I was really looking to replace a shirt/jacket I had that was very tough & rugged and that I wore outdoors all the time - a sort of heavy denim-type material (that looked nicer).This jacket isn't that. What LW calls the ""Weathered Cotton"" isn't that tough at all, though it kind of looks like it would be. In fact, it's kind of smooth, almost velvety but in a pleasant way. I don't know if their marketing phrase ""cotton suede"" is precisely accurate but it's sort of a good description.So I was initially pretty disappointed - I spent what, for me, was a lot of money and I didn't get the outdoors shirt that I could just walk through a bunch of brambles on a deer hunt, or throw under my backside to sit on a rocky beach while fishing, or whatever. But as time has passed, I've noticed that it is a great shirt/jacket for fall weather around town, and despite the rugged-ish look it's reasonably stylish. If you're taking the dog for a walk and then swinging by the bank afterwards, it's perfect. I end up wearing it a lot more than I thought I would, so that has made me come back and sort of reluctantly give it 4 stars.The sizing was fine, for me. The sleeves are longer than most shirts which is a huge plus for me at 6'5"". If you're on the shorter side of average that may be an issue. It's not super-warm, the sleeves are unlined, but if you're looking for a shirt/jacket that's more shirt than jacket, this is probably what you're after.TL/DR - this shirt isn't ""rugged"" or a better-looking version of Carhartt or whatever. But it is a pretty nice shirt and I've come to really like it and I wear the thing all the time now."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Money well spent,5,"I just received my jacket today. I read through the reviews and reviews on other websites. I'm a simple man and dropping this much cash on one article of clothing is way outside my comfort zone, especially buying online where I cant touch it and feel the quality and fit. After opening the package and trying it on I feel that my money was well spent. Its exactly what I was looking for.I ordered my regular size (XL) and it fits just as a jacket should. It's not billowing out anywhere but it's big enough that I don't feel constricted anywhere. I tried it on with a thin t shirt but a heavier shirt would be fine under it as well. I am 6ft tall and 230 lbs with a bit of a belly if that helps anyone with sizing. I also have a hard time with shirts and coats sometimes feeling a little too short. This jacket was perfect. It hangs past my waist, even with arms raised but it's not so long that it looks sloppy either.Some people complained about the pockets not being big enough or pockets being in an awkward position. I don't see that at all. My phone fit comfortably in the pocket and I wouldn't worry about it falling out. Keys fit as well. Not sure what else I'd need to put in a pocket that would be a deal breaker. I guess we all have different needs. The position of the pocket was pretty comfortable too. They are a little farther back than normal but not much at all.The jacket was pleasantly heavier than I expected. It feels pretty close to a well broken in denim jacket in weight and in texture on the outside. All the buttons look good and function as they should. The liner is nice. The inner sleeves are slick and not the flannel that is used in the cuffs and the torso area. I like that because it helps to not bunch up long sleeves when putting the jacket on.All and all this is a fantastic jacket for cool weather. It's very stylish yet very functional as well. I would not hesitate to buy this again."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,poor quality.,1,"blown out seam at shoulder. litter wore it maybe 3 or 4 times, and it hasn't been washed yet. just noticed the seam undone on the hanger. i get the feeling this was a factory second and it bothers me that it was sold without that being stated. unfortunately, i'm starting to find that irregulars are being sold on Amazon as regulars quite a bit now."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Nice Weight and Feel, But Runs Large",4,"They call this a shirt jacket, and it does lie pretty much in the middle between shirt and jacket. The exterior of it is a nice texture, but not quite the waxed-cotton feel I was hoping for - more synthetic because it's a poly-cotton blend. I generally like the look of it and the ""Army"" color is nice and neutral without being too green. My biggest problem with it is that it's cut very large. I'm 6' and around 200 lbs, and usually wear a size Large (42-44 which is the range this jacket suggest for a Large), but this garment in that size is definitely too roomy for me, particularly around the middle. I suppose if one wanted to wear a hoodie under this, it would be big enough to accommodate that, but then it's not really a shirt jacket, it's just a jacket. I might try a Medium size of this same garment but I'd be worried that it'd be too tight, since the size chart says that's really for 38-40 chest size."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Strange cut to this jacket,3,"The material feels a little odd, but seems to be good quality.For me, the issue is the fit.  Most 3X shirts fit me fine, and I've got short legs for my height and wear a 56L suit jacket.  This jacket fits me fine in the chest and shoulders with a comfortable amount of room while wearing a T shirt, however the waist would be uncomfortably snug if I weighed 50 lb less than I do.  This seems to be cut to fit someone with a 56 inch chest and a 36 inch waist, so if you're a competitive body-builder or need to carry a large firearm in a shoulder holster without printing, this might be the jacket for you (although the sleeves might be a little tight on a body builder).  Definitely returning this."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"I Really Like this ""Jacket""",4,"I really like this Jacket. It looks great, feels good on and is reasonably warm in chilly weather.As to water resistance I've only worn it in the rain a couple of times from car to door and I've not noticed water getting through so I'm not sure.Because others insisted it was about one size larger than the indicated size I ordered a 3X, Good Choice! I'm 6' 2"", 300 lbs and, while sitting about 60"" around at the belly button. I normally wear 3X or 4X shirts depending on the manufacturer.The sleeves are maybe an inch too long. The waistline is not as loose as I would like and it's a little roomy in the chest. My original thought, 4X, would have been too large.My biggest gripe is the snaps, hard to hit just right, especially with gloves. Someone indicated they sometimes didn't work. I already have one that comes apart too easily.I like it I'll probably order another eventually."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Nice shirt jacket, runs long",4,"I want to love this jacket.  It looks nice, feels of good quality.  I’m 5-11, 230 lbs...athletic with broad shoulders.  I bought both the L and XL with the intention of returning the one that didn’t fit.  The XL fits much better through the shoulders and torso, but it’s too long.  The L was too tight , but almost the same length.  Another thing that concerns me are the snaps.  I have a more inexpensive shirt jacket and the snaps are more secure.  I kept the XL and intend on taking it to a tailor to have it shortened a couple inches.  Overall, I really like this shirt jacket, even if it’s a little over priced in my opinion.  I gave it 3 stars because of the sizing and price, and the fact that I have to spend more money to have it shortened.  I also bought a similar shirt jacket by Gioberti here on Amazon, and I highly recommend it.****Edit....I had this shortened by a local dry cleaner by about 1.5 inches.  It’s no longer a “shirt” cut and I absolutely love it.  If it weren’t for the $15 I paid to have it tailored it would be 5 stars."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Poor quality, buttons fall off, too tight, looks gray online but more green IRL",3,"When reading the product info it says to size down. I typically wear XL but I did what it said and got a LG. I'm about 6' tall, 225lbs,  and 38 waist. It look perfect when I stand up however it feels a little tight on my shoulders. I have a bigger upper body than most I'd say not so much my gut but I have very wide shoulders. Sitting down it feels kind of silly as my shoulders free up but now its tight around the waist. One of the tracks fell off the cuff and luckily I saw it drop on the floor and fixed it or I would have been completely livid. The last thing that I dislike about this is the color. I know everyone's monitors arent the same and whatnot but to me this jacket looks grey. But in real life it's more of a green/gray. I'm not going to return this just for the fact that I dont want to deal with the hassle of doing so. But if I were to buy this again I'd get my regular size and not size down."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Pairs Well With A Beard, or Beer",4,"An excellent and recommended shirt jacket.  I'm about 215 lbs and 5' 11"", a size large is fits very well, particularly with a flannel or long sleeved shirt underneath.  I find myself warmer than most and this jacket is an ideal thickness for me, not too warm, not too thin.  It blocks wind well and seems to be waxed from the factory as it beads water.  Although if you're going to own this jacket, you should be receptive to learning how to wax canvas.There is a Velcro closed inside pocket, two outer hand pockets and two snap closed breast pockets.  Convenient for a cell phone, beard comb, lip balm, etc.  The side hand pockets hold keys without worry of them falling out.The inner arms are indeed nylon, which I prefer as it is easier to put on over a flannel or other long sleeved shirt.I should add, my fiancee asked that I wear this jacket for our fall themed couple's photos."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Size is not huge, tight when I ordered one size down and is not warm.",2,"The shirt is okay, but actually too small.  It does not have the robust feel of an authentic work shirt and is more of a facsimile of one, more of a fashion statement.  The material is thin from the lining to the outer material, so it’s doubtful to keep you warm on a windy day.  The big problem for me is that the company’s description said it was designed larger than normal to accommodate layering and to order one size smaller if you wanted a more fitted feel.  It is not larger than normal and the size small was too tight even with Just a t-shirt.  Also, if you get it on sale at Amazon, they won’t let you exchange it for the sale price if the price is raised again, even if you tell Amazon the product description is wrong about going one size down and send them a copy of the product text; you can’t go one size down.  Also, there are a ton of reviews saying the shirt is too large. It’s crazy."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Not to happy,1,"This shirt/jacket is perfect for me.  I wear it on a regular basis on the job site and love it for felling, cutting, splitting and stacking wood.  I'm planning on buying another one soon.UPDATE: I bought another one and it ripped the first day I had it.  I thought it was just a bad jacket so I requested a replacement.  Replacement received and the buttons wouldn’t stay snapped oh and 5 days in this one ripped as well.  For the price this should have been a bullet proof shirt/jacket but at this point I think I’ll probably try and find a Carhartt option."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Very comfortable, stylish and fits well",5,"Just returned from a guest ranch trip in Wyoming; use this shirt-jac for the cool mornings (30's) with a long sleeve t-shirt underneath and it was perfect. It was not my intention for it to be a really warm jacket, I wanted something for cool days, not necessarily cold days. It would likely be suitably warm with appropriate layering underneath. I am 6'1, 220 lbs and the XL it fits well, with room for layering underneath.I have not worn it in wet weather yet, so cannot speak to water resistance (hence only 3 stars for that attribute). The shirt-jac is well made, looks great and comfortable. This is my first Legendary Whitetails clothing, will now look at more of their line since I like this one so much."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Not 100% cotton, if that's important to you.",2,"Size X-large was way too big and billowy, looked like I was swimming around inside it. Returned it and bought a size Large, which was actually a bit too tight. Can't really wear it as a jacket, because it's also too short, looks kinda dopey. As others have mentioned, the snap buttons don't stay together on either size. Finally, although the description says 100% cotton, the tag inside the shirt reads ""Shell 63% cotton 37% polyester/ body lining 100% cotton/ sleeve lining 100% polyester"". The quality seems alright, but this didn't work out for me at all."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Looks great and feels nice,5,"I love how it's both a button shirt and a jacket at once. You have enough padding so you can be comfortable on chilly nights (though I'd recommend layers if youre getting to 40f or below) and I get many compliments whenever I wear it and its great for going out with friends or even date night.I'm a big fan of the pockets. Everything is properly stitched and doesn't feel like it was quickly tacked on industrially like other cheaper alternatives.I'm 6'4"" 450lbs so its hard to find something that fits, is comfortable, and stylish. This is one of the rare times I found an item that checks off all the boxes!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Neat Jacket,5,Nice jacket. I didn’t believe the other reviews and ordered my regular size. (4xl) It’s huge. Very roomie. The sleeves are a little long but I just roll em up. It’s definitely better with layered clothing but also makes a nice lightweight jacket. Looks good and feels soft. You may want to order a size smaller.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Hard to beat Spring jacket.,4,"The categories are ""Light weight""  ""Warmth"" and ""Water resistance"" This jacket kind of meets all three of these categories with a solid B+.And that's a pretty decent accomplishment. There's no jacket out there that's completely waterproof, warm, and lightweight.The only reason why I dinged it one star is because it's made in China, and for what Legendary is charging, they could afford to have the coats made in America. I mentioned that to them on their Facebook. You should too!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"I want to like it, but too big",2,"I love the way my large tall flannel shirts fit from Legendary Whitetails, but I am swimming in this. I was hoping I'd get use to it, but I hardly wear it. I waited too long and can't return it, so that's on me. I'm not sure if the regular large, or a medium tall would be the best fit... but I can't exchange it now anyway.I will say, aside from fit, I love the look of the outer material and overall quality and concept of this shirt-jacket. If I knew the right size for me, I think it'd look great.There is a design flaw with the hand pockets, which are a little too far back (by the side seams) to easily slide your hands into, or keep hands in pockets comfortably."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Good but oversized in the mid section,4,It's made well and feels nice the only thing I don't like i ordered a large because the medium is always too tight on my upper back and shoulders but the waist on it is way too big. I could add 30 lbs onto my stomach and it'd still have room to spare. I wish they offered a slim fit son their products but other than the sizing issue the side pockets are seat really far to the side which is really a pain in the a** when the mid section on the jacket is already too big. I pretty much have to reach behind my back to get my hands into the pecket. I took off a star for those because it's a mid section sizing issue but I'll just take it to a tailor and see if they can alter it to fit proper. I always recommend this company but always be carful about the size you order.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Disappointed... NOT well made.,1,I ordered this jacket for my son last November as a Christmas gift. With Covid.. we were not able to celebrate the holiday together until last week. I gave it to him. He wore it once and after an hour noticed the seem torn. It was not too small.. just not well made. I am very disappointed. I tried to find the order in my history.. but doesn’t go back that far.. so cannot return/exchange. Waste of money. I will now go and find another one.. different brand .. for him. 😔
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Oddly out of whack sizing and busted buttons.,1,"For a shirt jacket almost $100 dollars I would have thought quality would be a lot better. The sizing is just... way off. The torso area is perfect but the sleeves are MASSIVE, way too long and super super wide. The buttons are terrible, It would have been one thing if one or two of them weren't working properly but almost half of them are busted. the snap buttons don't hold into place if you can even get them to snap in the first place."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Great quality, surprisingly great quality!!!!!!!!!",5,"I live these jackets. It’s about 34° and these are decently warm. I was surprised it has pockets. Awesome! They feel good and fits true to size!!! Hard to find something that fits when you order online. The snap buttons are definitely securely fastened to the jacket on the front and sleeves. They easily snap on and off. I had to order two since I like them. The only issue, USPS did not deliver, they threw them over a privacy fence and did not notify me. The box and packages we all wet as this is the onset of late fall early winter. The great part, the are shipped packages in plastic sleeves that prevented them from getting damaged. I am definitely going to order some moreFor my two sons. Love these, love these love em!!!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,I love this jacket,5,"I try not to give many 5 star reviews so that they mean something. I love this jacket. Been wearing it for about a month. The only warning I will give people is that is its more on the jacket side of shirt jacket. If you are looking for something to wear inside and out, more like a heavy sweater, I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt jacked options. 5 stars because it delivers both on appearance and function. It looks great, kind of hard to describe. My wife said it looks like a ""farmer's version of a leather jacket."" The canvas-like material is pleasantly heavy. For a light jacket it is surprisingly warm. I was worried about how it would cut the wind but it does as good a job as the North Face shell it is replacing. Works as light jacket for temperatures in 40's and up, good top layer when colder. Highly recommended, unique product."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Good Jacket/Weird Pocket Placement,3,"This jacket is more of a 2.5 Stars jacket, but I rounded up because I do like it despite it's flaws. It fits well and it looks good. There are a few things that bother me about this jacket and some can't be fixed. Firstly when I took it out of the plastic it had an awful smell coming from it. It's difficult to describe what it smelled like exactly, but right away I tossed in the washing machine. Secondly, and honestly most importantly, the pockets on the jacket aren't placed where normal jacket pockets are. They are further back which makes it uncomfortable and awkward to put your hands in your pockets. Thirdly the jacket is made in China.Over all it looks nice and fits well. It would be a 4-5 star jacket if it wasn't for the front pockets."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Nice style, runs way too big",4,"Tried on a medium and immediately returned it.Like the style, workmanship seems good.Body and cuffs are flannel lined,Sleeves have a nylon linig, not being cheap, this is so you can layer and still get your arms in.Flannel would add friction and make it harder to put on.Size is ridiculous.I can always buy medium without tryin it on.Not this timeI had more than 8 inches of excess around the chest and the shoulders were more than 2 inches oversizedI am very medium, 39 chest, 32 waist, 6’, 160lbsThis felt like xxlI tried it over a bulky sweatshirt and it was still too big.I have ordered a small, but I am concerned that might not fit either."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great Jacket,4,"Love this jacket.  Only thing I thought was a bit odd are the side pockets.  For the first couple days of wearing this, I didn't think this jacket had pockets.  When I put on this jacket, I put my hands where I naturally expected there to be side pockets but I didn't feel any so I just assumed there were no pockets.  It wasn't until I started really looking at this jacket that I realized there are in fact pockets on the sides.  They just feel like they are set farther back on the jacket.  Other than that one minor detail, this is a great jacket."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Fit is off, not warm, and not comfortable to wear",2,"Was not what I was expecting; although to be fair it is called a shirt jacket, which is what I dislike about it. The outer material is jacket like; almost velvety. So if that's what you looking for, then this is perfect, I however, do not like it.The shirt/jacket/hybrid/thing is also not at all warm, nor comfortable to wear. It fits weird, as in it fits right around my body, so the liner is sized right, but it's almost as if the outer layer is a larger size and bigger (too much so) than the liner.For the price, it is not worth it at all, there are much better options out there. This feels and fits like a $25 shirt from a department store"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Wore it maybe 5 times and the threads are already separating.,2,"With such great reviews, I was very excited to get this for Fall but after one wash the threads started to come loose under the arm. I'll reach out to the manufacturer to see if it can be fixed."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,too expensive for what it is.,3,"decent thickness.  snaps come undone too easily.  waxed tarp feel(likely good in the rain).  left arm logo thankfully just sewn on and easily removable, would advise doing that prior to washing though to prevent shadowing.  pocket logo tag more difficult to remove without losing structural stitching, i just razor cut that very close to the fold. inside plaid nice looking, the buttons look like they would almost be reversible(making the shirt reversible), that would have upped this by a star. other companies sell nicer shirt jackets for equal or less. i would advise comparing before pulling the trigger on this one."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Wrong color fabric was used,1,The band at the top is the wrong color. It was supposed to be red but I got an orange one for some reason. As you can see the outside and flannel inside are correct. If the inside was orange too it would’ve at least been a bit more tolerable because red and orange don’t look good together. I really like the jacket but the orange band at the top drives me crazy and it just ruins the whole thing. Especially since you can see it while wearing it.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Cheap Crap,1,"Misleading pictures, poor quality, ill fitting, and overall unappealing. The fact that the company names itself ""Legendary Whitetails"" and then imports cheap Chinese crap says it all. This product is garbage."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Not for your standard big guy.,4,"I bought this for a man about 6 feet tall, 325 lbs. it’s a really nice shirt, but it’s not made for big bellies or short arms. The 3XL was at least 2 inches too long in the sleeves (I haven’t found this to be a problem with other brands). It fit around his big shoulders and chest but barely buttoned around his belly which isn’t a protruding beer gut, but bigger and wider than his chest."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Won't be Disappointed! Please READ,5,"Seriously try this jacket out, you won't be disappointed!! For me I'm 5'11"" 145lbs - (tall and skinny) I usually always wear XL but got Legendary whitetails in LT (large Tall) and it fits PERFECT!I am switching my whole closet over since I am a welder and work in a shop all day so this is the first clothing line I can wear daily and not destroy it like everything else I wear.I absolutely love this jacket and would recommend it to anyone. Legendary whitetails makes very high quality men's clothing that is still pretty reasonable considering all the name brands charge double and I still believe Legendary whitetails is nicer, more comfortable and very warm."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,2 month review,5,"was in my wish list for a year, price never changes. i'm 5'10 180# and ordered a medium, fits perfectly, can easily wear a shirt and a flannel underneath for extra warmth when needed. i was expecting it to be more of a fall/spring jacket here in massachusetts but it's been a fairly mild winter so i've been wearing it non stop, keeps me comfortable down to the teens, it hasn't gotten much colder but i'm sure i'd survive. don't see it falling apart any time soon, seems fairly rugged."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Okay-ish jacket. Slipshod construction. Keep shopping.,1,"Buttons on sleeves tore out within 1 month of wearing as a commuter jacket. Hand pockets are abnormally far back at your sides, causing very strange arm/shoulder position to get your hands in. All-in-all, this would be a fine $12 jacket. I definitely overpaid for the quality and for I received. I do not recommend purchasing this jacket."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Jacket as described, comfortable and sturdy.",5,"I'll preface this by saying I'm 6'5"" 220lbs average build. Bought the LT and it fits well. Chest and torso fit loosely, and sleeves are appropiate length for longer arms. Other reviews were spot on when they said you could fit a zipup under it, though it isn't uncomfortable to wear over a t-shirt. Build quality is good, two outside pockets 1 inside and material feels nice and study. Tested it on ~30° weather and was fine for it. I'll update the review if it falls apart in a month."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Worst buttons ever,1,The rings inside the snap buttons fall out extremely easily. I can't even button the jacket up now. Garbage.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Casual dressing at its best. Superior quality for a shirt/jacket. Highly-recommended,5,"First of all, this shirt/jacket is high quality, and incredibly stylish. My husband is that rugged guy, who always reaches for a heavy shirt/jacket in the cold months for the ease of layering his clothes, here in North Carolina, where one day is cold, and the next day, it’s 60 degrees in the winter time. This shirt makes casual look more dressy, yet comfortable. Can’t say enough about the quality of the shirt. It would be a welcomed piece for any guy to add to his wardrobe."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very disappointed for what it cost it should have lasted longer ...,1,Only had it a couple months and the stitching all the way down the right side from the armpit to the pocket has come apart. Very cheap made. Very disappointed for what it cost it should have lasted longer than this. I've had jackets that I paid less than half for that lasted 10 times longer than this.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Perfect Fit,5,"I found that 3XLT jackets were getting to be a little to tight a fit for layering. This jacket at 4XLT was a little large when it arrived but after I gave it a warm wash and hang dry it shrunk to as perfect a fit as I could ask for. It is as warm as you can expect a lightweight jacket to be, particularly with extra layers underneath. I bought some of the Whitetails flannel camp shirts to wear as a first layer. The combination is great"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great shirt/coat,5,Got this for my husband and he loves it. Very comfortable and warm enough to wear in fall. He’s actually worn it this winter on the warmer days. Light enough that it doesn’t weigh him down. Would highly recommend this just keep in mind it does run a bit wide through the body which was ok with my husband so he could put layers under if needed.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Must have for winter,5,"Great for cold weather, and water does bead off this very nicely, the material feels like a thin canvas but is very warm and the size of perfect, it has snaps which I like better than fumbling with buttons, great product!!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Changed their sizing,1,"Changed their sizing! Nothing fits anymore. I’m 6’3” 220lbs. Now Large tall fits a 5’9” 220lbs man and a XL tall fits a 6’1” man that weighs 280lbs! I’ve ordered 6 different shirt products and none fit. Great products, too bad they only fit short fat men. When did you last see an obese man climb up a tree to a deer stand? They need to go back to their old sizing!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Waste,1,"This product is way too big and boxy. If you’re a big guy, run with it. If you’re more athletic to regular size, you may want to consider a different product."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Perfect fit,5,"This is one of the best shirt/ coat I ever bought. Besides a perfect fit for being tall and thin, the material is superior inside and out. The inside of the sleeves are smooth making it easy to put on, take off.Probably buy a few more of these before it gets obsolete."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very nice materials & workmanship,5,"Nice quality & very comfortable, nice size side pockets. I doubt that the velcro closure on the inside chest pocket will last long before tearing loose, but otherwise I think this will be my favorite light weight shirt jacket for the forseeable future."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,My new favorite jacket,5,"Upon receiving the shirt jacket I was very pleased with the look of it. It’s just the right weight. When I put it on I was pleasantly surprised that the lining of the sleeves was a satin-like material which makes it super easy to put on and take off no matter what you’re wearing.  It has a great style and look to it and I have had a lot of people ask me where they could get one. It feels durable, but time will tell.  It’s very comfortable and worth money. I highly recommend this shirt jacket."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Better than ok, but could be more sturdy.  My son loves his.",4,"I bought this for my son for Christmas.  When he opened it he said ""Where am I going to wear this?!""  Needless to say, he loves it and wears it almost daily as a jacket.  The only issue he had was the one armpit ripped out when he raised his arm during the 2nd time of wear.  Luckily it was something I could fix.  It's a nice looking item, but quality of workmanship could be improved.  I more than likely will be buying more in the near future and he will just have to remember to use it gently.  Btw, he loves the material and all the pockets."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Snaps dont function!!!  Exchanged same problem different color,1,Nice jacket BUT for $80 you would expect snaps to function.  1/2 do and 1/2 dont.  Exchanged item different color and same problem.  Not the only one reporting this problem either.  Better off saving money and looking at CQR Jackets - excellent quality and quality control.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great Brand,2,"One button on the right wrist is too small and I can't snap it. Other than that, I love the jacket. Very comfortable. One of my favorite brands. I'd give it a perfect 5 stars if that one snap worked.Update, 2 wrist buttons don't work as they should. I didn't notice this originally. I love this jacket but find it very aggravating that the buttons are consistently popping off."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Reliable Lightweight jacket.,5,"When I went to Seattle I brought the jacket with me and it handled really well with the weather there.  Buttons up, but at times I wanted to put my hands in pockets.  It doesn’t have any, but overall not a bad jacket.I stand corrected.  The jacket actually does have pockets.  Before I only wore once while in Seattle, but now that it’s cold here today I found pockets.  Definitely buying another one now."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Cheap materials not cheap price,2,Felt great.Unfortunately for the money I would not have expected it to rip on the second day while I was only trying to adjust it by pulling it cause it was bunched up from my lunch bag.Ripped right up the left seem at the waist.Then about a week later I tried to open up the inside pocket and the velcro is stronger then the material and it ripped about 2/3 down and through the flannel.Cost too much for this sub par materials
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Could have been an awesome jacket,3,"When I first came across this item. I thought, that’s exactly what I’m looking for. When I received it. The first thing I noticed was the weight. It is not light weight. After a quick once over I laid it on my couch to get an overall view. I start scanning it from top to bottom. Everything was looking good until I got to the bottom of the shirt I mean jacket. This jacket has the same pattern of a long sleeve shirt. I was so disappointed that I paid $75 for a long sleeve canvas shirt with a flannel liner."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Underwhelming,3,"It was “ok”. I wasn’t blown away as much as I hoped I would be and I don’t find myself reaching for this as I head out the door. If the weather is brisk but not cold, it’s too heavy If it is cold outside it’s not heavy enough. It also fits bigger than it should. I bought a 2X and it fits like a 3x.I’ve worn it once in the past few weeks I’ve owned it. It’s not my favorite nor do I dislike it."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very attractive jacket,4,"Just about the coolest damn jacket I have ever had. I am 6'1"" 215 with a medium/large build, large arms and wide shoulders, and I got a large and it fits perfect. The other reviews are right on about the big fit as far as the listed sizes go. Get 1 size smaller. I wear xl in shirts and jackets normally.It is not very thick. Perfect for weather between 30's and 60's. Rain doesnt get through.One of the snaps just broke off and that pissed me off. Hopefully I can fix it."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Strange sizing,3,"I'm 6'0"", 195 lbs.  The large drowns me, but the medium is too short in the sleeves.  They really need to make a medium tall for guys like me that have a more athletic build."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Would Buy More,5,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband, who is on the shorter and more slender side. Surprisingly, the Small fit him without being too bulky, unlike a lot of shirt jackets I've bought him in the past. He has worn it several times already (yes, I know it is December 28th, he likes it that much) over a sweatshirt and he has commented on how well it keeps wind out and warmth in. Would buy again in more colors!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Runs big,4,"I'm normally between a large and XL.  I buy large T-shirts and either large or XL jackets as they can get tight in the shoulders and short in the sleeves.I bought a large and it is a little baggy.I'm 6,3"" and considered the tall but opted to just get the normal large.  The sleeves are the perfect length."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Perfect Fit!,5,"I'm 6'6"" tall and about 260lbs. I normally wear XLT shirts. Got this in XLT and it fit perfect. The overall length and length of the sleeves are just right. It's light weight, but still warm. It has enough room to still be worn over a long sleeve flannel. Been using it as my regular jacket the last 3 months and it still looks brand new."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Too snug fir my belly.,4,"This was to replace a simular shirt that I have worn out and is no longer available. The problem for me, as an older individual with a bit of a spare tire wasteline, is that with everything else fitting great body is too snug to comfortably fit."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Good Value,4,"Recently I took a look in my closet and found I only had black leather jackets. With spring approaching, I needed a lighter option. This Legendary Whitetales jacket was the solution to the problem. The lining is excellent and surprisingly warm. The left and right exterior ""hand pockets"" are a little awkwardly far back. Accessing them isn't quite as natural as I've come to expect wearing bomber jackets. Also, the internal pockets are a tad lacking in capacity. Won't quite fit my phablet (iphone xs max) which is a shame and the only thing keeping this product from 5 starts. A fair competitive option would be the Kuhl Burr. I went with this LW jacket instead as the I didn't feel the added value proposition justified the higher price of the Kuhl ($110-$120usd). All in I'd recommend this jacket as a great spring/fall option."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great light weight jacket,5,"I bought this jacket 3 months ago and it's held up just fine and looks great. I'm 6 foot 5 in and around 220 lb, the extra large tall size fits perfectly. Which is hard for me to find. It's not a very heavy jacket oh, I live in Florida and it's perfect for the winter is here, but I took it up North with me to northern Idaho and layered a thick hoodie with it and t-shirt and was fine. Highly recommended"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Feels like a comfy old jacket right out of the package.,4,"I like wearing this jacket.  For me it's kind of a tactile thing.  I'm told that it looks good on me, too.I do wish the sleeves were a little shorter. Though."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Didn’t like the shape.,1,Goofy fit.  Chest fit great then was huge around midsection down to waist!!!  Very odd shape.  Returned for quick refund
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great knock around/chore jacket,5,"Really like this jacket for temps in the 50s and doing light yard work-- or whatever.  I had non-working snap on it.  The vendor did an incredibly fast job of replacing it.  My brother liked the jacket so much, he bought one as well.If they made it with a little heavier material I'd buy one of those too."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Snaps are cheep garbage,1,I like everything about this shirt jacket besides the snaps... which makes the product pretty useless. I’m a farmer and bought it for work and it went in the giveaway pile in less than two weeks. Cheep junk made in China
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Excellent,5,Excellent shirt jacket. Outer layer is thick and keeps the wind from going through the shirt. Inside layer is nice and warm. Great way to stay warm without too much bulk. Highly recommend. They are also good looking shirts
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Nice,4,I like the fact that it is light weight has that little bit of insulation in the inside with a flareup in the outside appears to be water resistant so it’s just a nice all around the middle of the road warm but not too warm jacket
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Size down,5,Definitely size down like the other reviewers say.  My SO only wears XL.  There is literally nothing in his closet that is L.  I bought him the XL and he was swimming in it.  The L fits him perfectly.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Runs big.,5,"Great jacket. Runs big, so get a smaller size. I had to return it. I clicked the xl selection before reading the reviews.I will order a large. I do wear xl shirts/coats etc. But this runs larger. Listen to the majority of reviews before ordering and order a size smaller. I gave it 5 stars because the quality is great and cant wait to receive my replacement."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Weak snaps but great look.,3,"I am displeased with how weak the snaps are. I was shoveling snow this weekend and the snaps would not stay fastened. The snaps at the cuff are weak too.  Super annoying!On another note, I do get a fair amount of compliments while wearing this shirt/jacket. It does a nice job of breaking the wind and keeping the moisture out.It's decent enough looking and functioning garment. Don't expect to wear it to do any kind of manual labor while keeping it buttoned up."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Good product, but amazon charged full price for an open box item",1,"looks great, and is a comfy shirt. Has a pretty good fit, too.the only reason i am unsatisfied is that amazon sent me an item that was clearly previously opened. The bag the jacket was packaged in was cut open and the item had the tags removed from it."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Too bad about the snaps,4,"The shirt is exactly what I wanted in terms of materials and lining. Appears to be high quality but until I have worn it more and washed it a few times I cannot be sure. Maybe the description made clear that the fasteners were snaps rather than buttons. The snaps, particularly at the cuffs, tend to not stay closed. I probably would have bought it anyway, but I wish it had used buttons."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Even better than I thought it was going to be.,5,"I love the fit. It’s loose enough to wear a hoodie underneath it, but doesn’t balloon out. I wear it all the time. I am 5’7” and about 190, but I have an athletic build, large around the chest, shoulders, and arms and smaller around the waist.. I went with a large and it was a perfect fit."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very nice durable jacket,5,This isn’t light weight it’s heavy and perfect for fall and winter. My husband really loves it and I think it looks nice on him! Casual yet stylish
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Tool,5,I do like this jacket it fits me very well I was a little skeptical about all the reviews but when I got it not so  bad I just like the color and I like to how it  fits  keeping me warm right now I live in Arizona so we don't really need jackets and I would say this one kinda goes good with a little fashion depending on your line of work for construction it looks well on me
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very Nice... But could be better,4,"I really like this as a bridge between Ohio's winter and summer, in those spring days where it is very cool to start. Very nice material, it looks great and is very, very comfortable.That said, this would be a 5 star plus if they would lose the snaps and put a nice Carhart style heavy duty metal zipper in it."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Beautiful -,5,"A perfect spring/fall light jacket/heavy shirt. Nicely tailored. I've purchased 2 of these so far - highly recommend, well worth the price."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Worth the money!,5,My new favorite jacket to wear.  Light enough that you dont get overly hot during chores but warm enough that you dont have to wear a ton if layers to make it worth while.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great Shirt Jacket That's Perfect for Travel,5,Could not decide between gray and coffee. Figured I'd order one to see how it fit and if it's as good as others had said. Package was waiting when I got home. When I picked it up I immediately noticed the weight and how sturdy it felt. When I opened package I was thrilled to see it looked better than expected. Tried it on and really liked the fit. I'm 40 Reg and usually wear large but after reading other reviews went with medium which fits me perfectly. Leaving enough room for sweater. This will be a great jacket for travel.  Machine washable too. So happy with purchase that I just ordered the coffee color too.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Hints of greatness,3,"I've lusted after this jacket for awhile, and I just received it today. Long story short, it's laughably huge on me. I'm 5'10"", roughly 165 with a lean athletic build. Compared to every other medium jacket I own, this feels more like an XL. Needless to say, it's very disappointing considering the shipping took over two weeks.Otherwise it has a lot of potential. It's gorgeous, pleasingly heavy, and feels warm. I'm shipping it back first thing tomorrow to exchange for a small. If it's still too big, I will likely keep it and have it taken in a bit. I realize this is geared more towards hunting than fashion, but it's extremely nice looking.I plan to update my review then."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Disproportionate shirt tail.,3,"Very nice quality, but did not look good on me. I'm only 5'6"" and the shirt tail was way too long. Medium is not a large size for a man, so I thought the shirt tail was disproportionate. Had to return as I wanted to leave it untucked."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Nice shirt; but it’s big...(That’s what she said),4,"It truly is sized up.  I’m 6’2” and 275lbs and ordered a XXXL thinking it’d fit to where I wouldn’t HAVE to layer it.  I was wrong.  A thick hoodie will have to be worn under it to fit properly.  I was too scared to do XXL, but should have since I don’t want to layer."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great looking light shirt/jacket,5,"After wearing the short nearly everyday for a month,  the quality seems to be holding up,  with no problems with the stiches or snap closures.  Very comfortable lightweight over - shirt for inside wear un-buttoned, and It's been warm enough for brisk walks outside in temps down to 37F (3C )"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"It's a good jacket, it's comfortable to wear",5,"The only complaints I can think of are that I had to wash it to shrink it a bit, and it was a bit lighter in color than I expected. I thought it would be a darker gray on the outside.It's a good jacket, it's comfortable to wear, it has held up great through two or three washings, and I'm glad I bought it which is more than I can say for the majority of clothes I buy online. It is not as warm as you might think from the flannel lining, which may be a plus or a negative depending on your perspective. I was worried I'd be overwarm in it when wearing it as normal clothing while indoors but it's really not too overwarming in my opinion."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Nice jacket.,3,Lighter than I would have expected.  I was hoping for a sherpa filled flannel liner but feels very durable.  I should have bought an XL #covid15
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Too Bad...,2,"Loved wearing this as a light outer...but it ripped horribly on the second wear. No excessive stress was applied to the garment, as I didn't even notice it until I started to adorn it for the third time. Too bad, as I really liked the weight and feel."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Great quality, great fit, just make sure to get one size smaller if you get the ""TALL"" version",5,"Great jacket. I bought another after this of the plaid shirt/jacket. One thing though, the XL (which I usually buy) was too large, being 6'2"" the large was perfect (maybe even still just slightly big). The ""tall"" is great because its not baggy but rather just long in the height and sleeves, hard to find for us taller guys"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great buy,5,Fits great! Thinner then I thought it would be from looking at the pictures but perfect for the fall and outer layer over a hoodie. Material seems durable so far. Would buy another to have another color too. Looks great too friends complemented much on it. Overall very happy with it!
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Nice look,5,"I bought this shirt/jacket for fall weather in North Dakota.  I bought it as a medium.  I am 6'0"" and 175 lbs.  The fit was perfect, but I better not gain another pound.  I really liked the cut, look, and weight.  It was just right for that 40-55 degree weather.  It is fairly casual and outdoorsy, but I liked the look so much that I tried getting away with wearing it to my office job on several occasions.  It was a bit pricey for the weight of the jacket, but I would definitely buy again.  Happy with this purchase."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Get a size smaller,5,Very nice jacket for a very solid price. Get a size smaller though. I’m usually a Large in jackets but had to exchange it out for a medium. It’s good for casual occasions and anything outdoors.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Runs Big,3,"Runs large, had to return it. Didn't seem like a bad jacket but did seem a little expensive after seeing it in person, considering it really is just a heavy duty button down shirt.Looked nice though, seemed well made."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very nice,5,Kind of expensive for a shirt but the quality is great!  This is more of a shirt/jacket.  My daughter put some cool patches on it and I have gotten lots of compliments.  If you wear XL normally then get the Large in this brand.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Looks great but not very warm.,4,The style is terrific but the warmth is sorely lacking. It's a very thin material and is sufficient for temps in the fifties without serious layering. I didn't get any defects in materials or workmanship noted by others. I'm considering waterproofing it to make it a useful rain protective jacket.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Amazon packaging ruined the look of the jacket,3,The coat would be awesome if not for all the wrinkles and deep seams that didn't come out after wash and dry. Have to try another wash and dry. Amazon keeps denying rewiew so I can't give more details. The packaging is becoming a real problem.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Fit,5,"Hunting as I live in the desert and it would be to warm to wear here. It fits and looks good. Haven't had to use it in the rain,thus the 4 stars. I have several Legendary Whitetail products and are all excellent."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Soft and comfy; too baggy,3,This feels like a nicely made shirt. The flannel lining is really soft and comfortable. The outer shirt material is flexible and not stiff like some other brands. My issues are with the fit. I’m a slim guy and this fits big on me even after ordering a size down. The arms are really baggy and it’s really long for my taste.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Stout Jacket--For The Stout Fellow.,3,"This thing's huge. I wear a large in everything, so I figured I'd buy a large here. I would advise against making that mistake. However, this is a beautiful jacket, very warm and hardy. Since it didn't fit me, I gave it to a friend who wears XL/XXL. It fits him perfectly and looks great! I'd buy a new one for myself, but sadly my wallet says no."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Looks nice but bad quality,1,Coming apart along the seam... Bad quality avoid these
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Snaps..why did it have to be snaps,3,Overall this shirt/jacket is pretty nice. My only real gripe is the snaps..The ones on the cuffs tend to get caught on the backpack I wear every day. The price is too high also. the other flannel version of this shirt are half the price.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Perfect when paired with flannels and thermals.,5,"Great jacket, i love it. Only issue is it fits a little larger than I expected, however layer it with one of the legendary white tails flannel shirts and thermals, its perfect for us men up in the PNW."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Runs big!,3,My husband returned this because the large was way too big. I would size down a size when purchasing. Nice jacket though.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very nice light jacket,4,"I like this jacket. The sleeves are nice and roomy which for a larger guy like myself is very nice. It has lots of room, and I have had no issues with quality at all. This is not a very warm coat however, so you will want a layer or hoody beneath this for colder weather. It's not meant to be a parka."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,I love it and highly recommend,5,"Fabulous jacket. It's very comfortable and war,  It probably will not be warm enough when temperatures get into the teens and single digits.  Until then I will enjoy wearing this coat. Very handsome and I love the snap closures."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Poor quality,1,Less than 2 months and the jacket is falling apartWithin 2 months the pocket liner has ripped through as well the exterior stitch of right pocket are separating.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Would not call it a jacket, too light",3,"Nice looking shirt, a lot lighter then expected for the price. Bought a similar shirt/jacket for a lot less that was much more comfortable and warmer. I won't be buying another one of these"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Good Jacket,5,Love the jacket.  The quality seems very good and the size is perfect.  I am a 3xl big guy and it fits just like all the other 3xl I have not overly big like some reviews have stated.  The jacket looks nice and its a bit blacker then the picture looks and i like that.  Snaps seem made well so i look forward to seeing how it holds up..
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Perfect gift,5,I got this for my dad for his birthday and he has been wearing it out this fall and barely lets my mom wash it.  He’s tall and stretched out and this fits his frame perfectly.  He wears it for an extra layer for warmth.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great classy look ...,5,"Received this today. Fts perfect. Looking it over before wearing, Pop! Oh no! Shirt opened up...Thought a button fell off.. Nope it has snaps! Soperfect for a rough fellow as myself. Great look, classy. Great workmanship... i'll have this fr a many seasonal changes Going o ordr a different color."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Highly Recommend,5,"If you are considering getting this, DO IT! I got it for my boyfriend and he loved it! It is comfortable and dressy. It adds to any outfit and dresses it up."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Husbands favorite,5,My husband loves this jacket so much i had to order another one just like it.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"So nice, I bought a second in a different color",5,"Very nice shirt jac, warm and looks great.I bought the large tall and it fits perfect."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great shirt for the upcoming weather,5,"Great shirt for the upcoming weather. I noticed a lot of reviews mentioned the sizes ran a bit bigger than expected and I agree. I typically wear XXL shirts. I ordered this product in XL and it's baggy on me in a good way. Enough room to be comfortable if I have a couple layers on underneath. So definitely measure before you buy so you can get the right fit, don't just go based on what you typically wear."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Looks great and amazing quality!,5,"Very nice manly looking shirt jacket. I have gotten a few compliments on it and was asked a couple times where I got it. It is kind of pricey, but the quality is great! The snaps are very well made and I know it will hold up for years. The outside material is kind of leather, suede, and cotton... hard to decribe. Overall, great looking jacket and will hold up for years. I wear it to and from work in 40 degree temps and I am warm enough."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Comfortable,5,"Very comfortable. Exactly what I needed for this time of year, cool in the morning and 50/60 in the afternoon."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great jacket/shirt.,5,"Very nice looking shirt with a suede sort of feel type material on the outer shell, runs a bit large. I usually wear xl but I ordered a large and it fits just fine. The quality is good but the snaps look a bit flimsy. The color is as pictured, ordered the barley. This is by no way for cold weather, more like a spring or fall jacket. Canadian resident."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Snaps do not stay shut,3,I give this 3 stars because the snaps do not stay shut/together when I am riding.  Snaps look great but for me this would have been better with some buttons so the wind does not blow them open.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Im getting a lot of compliments...,5,"This shirt jacket absolutely rocks.  You need to buy one size down no matter what.  I am an XL in all things clothes, read reviews, bought a large, and it fits nice if not a micro-tad big.  I love it, though.  Also, I originally ordered the tobacco, loved it so much bought the tarmac - the difference between them is barely detectable.  To legendary white tails - make the colors more distinctive from each other and i will buy more."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Over priced,3,Looks nice! Doesn’t fit like it should. But it’s cheaply made. My husband tried to put his hands in the pockets and the side seam console the ripped!! Not worth the price at all! So cheap!
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great shirt jacket,5,Bought this as a gift for my boss and he loved it. Great fit and quality product. Would recommend.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Grab and Go Chore Coat,4,"This sucker started out as a morning firewood/feed the animals light coat but quickly became more a ""must have in my truck at all times"" type of thing. The side pockets are sweet, the textile material is decent weight with a gloss finish. Breaks in nice and fits good."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,More jacket than shirt,4,"It looks like a shirt, but wears more like a jacket.  outer shell is soft plasticky layer, probably somewhat rain proof.  Still this is nice, feels like quality and looks good on."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Nice warm hybrid between light jacket and heavy shirt,4,"Keeps you warm and appears to be decent quality, but pocket snap button broke before I even got it out of the bag.  I super glued it on and so far it’s held up.  I haven’t had the need to wash it yet, so I hope it holds up.  I like it and it does what I wanted it for, keep warm and comfortable around the house."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Love it.,5,"I think this jacket is supposed to emulate the look of the Cabela's/Field & Stream clothing, none of which is my thing, really. However, not having realized that at the time I ordered it, the fit and the warmth provided were perfect. Love this jacket."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Good size, comfortable",5,"I'm 5' 6"" ish, 165 pounds, and purchased the medium. Good size, fits well. It's a nice outdoor jacket for fall weather, but now that the weather is turning winterish, I also wear it around the house rather than a flannel shirt. Washed it twice already, no problems."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Sturdy work Shacket,3,"At 6'2"" 230 lbs, I ordered a L tall.  the length in the arms and waistline are great!  One issue is the armpits are tight.  I have big shoulders, and it's not the shoulder size that is small it's literally the armpit holes are too high.  When I lift my arms in the air I can feel the tightness in the coat.  If I cross my arms the shoulders have enough room."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,A snappy garmentI get,4,"I get complements on this garment. It's perfect for cool summer evenings. However, the snap closures are difficult  to ""spap"" shut."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great jacket,5,"A little pricey but probably worth it.  Dressy enough to wear out but also rugged enough to take in the woods.  Have worn to rainy ballgames and was pretty watertight.  Well made and overall a really nice jacket.  Fit well too.  I'm a very large 6'3""  300 lb guy and a 4x fit perfect."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Rugged look with a comfortable fit,5,"Although this shirt is rather expensive, I am very satisfied with the product.  It is well made, and fits comfortably.  Getting a size larger than normal allows this shirt to be used as a jacket, especially when worn over a flannel vest."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,and doesn't look like the picture,1,"This thing is really long, and doesn't look like the picture. There is something about the pockets that just looks off. Tight in the chest but way too long. I don't get all the rave reviews. I sent it back at my expense."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Looks good and wears great,5,"I'm not one to wear a coat; this thing is the closest that I can bring myself to wear. I love it in rain and cool weather! Not too much and not too little...just right in the cold, snow and rain!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,So BIG,4,"My boyfriend is 6'4"" 190lbs. and often has a hard time finding shirts that are long enough with sleeves that hit the right spot.  I ordered a large (his normal size) in the tall.  IT WAS GIGANTIC! I couldnt believe how big and wide it was.  So I ordered a regular Medium and it fits him fine. The sleeves are a tad short but the overall fit is much better."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"The shirt/jacket is nice. I am 5'11"" 180lbs and the large is ...",4,"The shirt/jacket is nice.  I am 5'11"" 180lbs and the large is a hair big but not bad.  I was a little surprised at the glossiness of the material as I was expecting more of a Carhert jean material and it Is more like a plastic coating over a very light denim."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,It's a great light weight jacket!,3,"It's a great light weight jacket, with one small complaint......the stitching on it isn't made for much durability! I, caught a door handle with the front right pocket, and turned. It tore the stitching over 10""!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Nice & lightweight,5,Very comfortable. Great for evening temperature drops.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Looks good, well made",5,"I really like this jacket. It's well made, but it's not very warm. Perfect for me!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Get a size down or you will be sorry.,2,"Dont get me wrong, its an ok jacket. But in my opinion, really not worth the 80$ price tag. Also, it runs really large. Order a size down for sure or else youll be swimming in it. I definetley should have ordered the medium, I usually get large but this fits like an XL. I dont know much about whitetail, but really seems like youre paying for a name. Plenty of other, better jackets out there for far less."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Feels very cheap,1,DONT BUY THIS if you're looking for something that feels and fits like a heavy shirt. Its not that. Its basically a crappy leather jacket. Very cheap feeling pleather type material on the exterior and the inside of the jacket is a very thin felt material. For around $80 you might as well just go buy a Carhartt.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Hubs loves it,5,"Bought this for my husband off of his wishlist, he loves it.  Every time he puts it on he mentions how it's so great, how much he loves it!  The quality, the weight of the fabric, how it's light but warm (thanks to the inner flannel lining."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Not very warm, but I like it",5,This is expensive for what it is but I like it. Wear it over a hoodie for added warmth.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Comfortable and warm,5,"Perfect middle weight coat, very comfortable. I don’t spent a ton of time outside in jacket weather. So all I needed was something more than a windbreaker. This is exactly what I was looking for!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,The shirt fit as expected the color matched almost dead ...,3,The shirt fit as expected the color matched almost dead on. My only problem is  the inside pocket with the velcro. From the constant pulling on the velcro the pocket has started to rip from the inner lining after 2 months of wear
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Husband Loves,4,"I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it. The only commentary as far as how it fits is he said it was an odd combination of tight in the armpits but long in the sleeves, if that makes sense."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Looks Great and fits as advertised,5,This made a great gift for a friend of mine who still wears it today.  Size fit him perfectly as he is Tall 6ft 3.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Cheaply made.,2,"It ripped under the armpit less than a year old and only minimal use (seriously, like worn 15-20 times total and then it was just out to eat, not used for working outside or anything)I loved this coat and am sad it was made cheaply 😕👎"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Nice but overpriced for its quality,4,"My son loves this jacket! My only complaint is I feel it’s overpriced for the quality, the material used is thin and low quality."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Quality control.,2,"2 stars, because the jacket seems very nice, but I will be returning it and reordering. The jacket was not packaged nicely, seemingly shoved into the plastic wrapping. It also smells horribly of cigarettes. I tried it on for 5 seconds and it’s strong enough that the smell lingered in my hair. Quality control?"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Looks good but not functional,2,"Looks good, fits good and pretty roomy, feels pretty warm, but the snaps don’t work very well.  Can’t keep it snapped which really defeats the function of it.  The smallest movement unsnaps the coat.  For as much as this is, the buttons should stay snapped,"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Excellent quality,5,"Excellent quality, very soft both inside and out, bought a 2x for him which was true to size (height 5'11 weight 220) machine washed very well and tumble dried on low it looks and fits the same even after"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great Quality Whitetail Shirt Jacket,5,"The quality of this shirt jacket is EXCELLENT!  It is well worth the price.  The quality is quite evident in the stitching, lining and fabric.  Very soft, cozy and warm, great for temperatures 40 degrees and above."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Excellent,5,"Nice quality and worth the money. Great with jeans (work, home or out to dinner). Perfect!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Fantastic!,5,"Great jacket!  Sturdy, warm, and looks good.  They recommend ordering a size down which I did.  It fits great but there is not much room for layering.  If you live in a colder climate and plan to layer definitely order your normal size. Really like this jacket!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Good but needs improvement,3,Style is great. Good shirt but snap buttons don’t stay put.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Was great for a few weeks...then lack of quality showed.,1,"I really liked this jacket (though it is sized one size too big...) Unfortunately, you cannot place your hands in the pocket or else the entire side of the jacket will rip apart. What's really weird about this jacket is that the pockets are about 1-2 inches closer to your back than a normal jacket. I would really like to have one that is ""roadworthy"". I did receive a number of compliments on the style."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Nice, I would have gotten another if the pockets ...",3,"Nice, I would have gotten another if the pockets were in a better position. Pocket placement was the only downside to this jacket.Ok so I've been using this as a shell with my hoodie under it now for about 2 weeks. I'm living in Germany and it can be a bit cold, the hoodie and jacket combo is awesome. Layering something underneath helps keep it warm and the shirt Jacket does well to keep the wind from biting.Jacket it well made and will last for years."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,its good,4,my husband loved the color. My husband is 6'4 and almost 300 lbs. He got a 3x and it was way to big. very heavy but nice looking.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very cheap material,1,I would have returned this if it cost $20. It is incredibly cheap. For $80 I expected a much more quality item.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Worth the money,5,Super cool jacket it fits well and is very nice
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Fit as expected,4,"We found the sizing to fit as expected. One side seam came unsewn but was easily repaired. This a great looking, practical coat."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,High Quality Jacket,5,This jacket is high quality and pretty warm. I mainly wear it around the house and it works well for that. Material is definitely sturdy and it feels well made.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,love LW! just not this one...,4,"peeves:1. lower pockets are weirdly set back too far, they are almost back by your hip bone. if you have the shirt open you feel like you can't even comfortably put your hands in your pockets.2. One of the other reviewers are right, the velcro on the inside breast pocket is way too strong and you feel like it's going to rip the liner when you use it, maybe it will loosen up over time3. I personally don't like that it almost has tails. For a shirt that is not meant to be tucked in, it should be more flat on the bottom. The pictures on Amazon don't really fully describe the bottom border of the shirt, it almost looks silly in my opinion but maybe that's a style thing I don't knowAside from these things, the shirt is beautiful. I plan on wearing it with a plain grey Hanes t-shirt and I have no doubt it will keep me sufficiently warm. It feels like it has a lot of quality in it as well, it feels heavy and solid and I don't mind spending a couple extra dollars for something like this. I have bought a number of their shirts, I like this one, I won't return it, but I prefer the flat bottom flannels with the hood or the plain lined flannel shirts better"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"For $89 you should receive quality, recommend the start doing heavy duty stitching",2,"For spending $89 you should get better quality, corner of pocket tore first day I used it. I returned it immediately and got something better made. I normally love legendary white tails but this was the first product I bought I was disappointed in. I still own over 13 different flannel jackets and heavy duty jackets/ vests from them that I love."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Be aware of sizes, follow your chest measurement for the best fit.",4,"I love this shirt jak, I originally ordered a LT but had to exchange it for a medium, which is on the tight side but a better fit for me than the LT which was huge. The return/refund and reorder was incredibly easy, so I thank Amazon for that! As for the shirt jak I gave it 4 stars because the only difference between a Large and a Large Tall is longer sleves. Legendary whitetail needs to change the sizing so that a large fits people who are in between Medium and Large Tall such as myself."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Just a thin jacket,4,"I bought this for my husband. Although we both really like it, we thought it was a shirt/jacket combo. It’s not. It’s jist a thin jacket with the flannel coloring on the inside. If we had realized, we probably would not have bought it but it looks nice and it durable."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Runs big, but nice and rugged",5,"This shirt jacket is great. Kinda disappointed that the sleeves are not flannel lined as well, but not a deal breaker. Does fit big, but it’s made for layering. Also pretty light, worn alone just keeps the wind off of you. Wash it once and it takes some of that shine out it and starts looking even more rugged.I wear it with jeans, a polo and some boots and it looks and feels great, but a good bit large on an already fat guy. Also got it in tall and the length is perfect."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very nice jacket.,5,We have bought a few of these because my husband loves them. They fit well and are great for all occasions.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,All-Around Great Buy,5,I like the suede exterior and the flannel lining.  I typically wear a XXL shirt but the XL Tall fits me perfectly.  Very nice - I like the weight of it yet how thin it is.  I’m going to enjoy wearing this in the fall and winter.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Wear this. It’s awesome.,5,Runs a size big. I am a large dude. 6’ tall and 300 pounds. Got a 4 xlt and I am swimming in it. It’s a great coat though. Love the feel and looks great!
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Worth the money,5,Very we made. Love it!
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Poorly placed pockets,3,"The opening to the pockets are much further back on the jacket than most, making it awkward to put your hands in them. A hole has already opened by the pocket, most likely from the extra tension from the poor placement.Otherwise decently warm and comfortable. Probably not worth the price."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Nicely made shirt!,5,"Like the color, fabrics and construction.  Too bad I won't get to test it until mid-late Fall."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great Looking Jacket,4,"I really like the way this jacket looks and feels. I'm a bigger person and usually wear 3x. I bought this in the 4x size to ensure it would fit even over bulky sweatshirts. It is a bit big on me so I could have probably gone with the 3x. My only gripe and it a minor one is the sleeve length. Hence the loss of one star. It's not a huge deal though as you can flip them once and there is a nice flannel pattern visible when you do. For the price in a plus size jacket, this is a good deal."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,As expected,5,Usually buy this for a gift each year and this company has never let me down... quality is great and worth every dollar! Thank you
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,It's true to size,5,Purchase a 3X for my husband he's a tall man not heavy fit him beautifully with a little room to move looks very smart and good quality thank you
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Warm and water resistant,5,Bought this for my fiance for Christmas. The XL is longer then expected but fits true to size every other way. It has a waxy coating on the outside that makes it water resistant.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Low quality,1,I got this shirt as a gift for christmas.  The seams started unraveling along the sides and under the arm.  Had it less than a month.  Never washed it or did anything crazy with it.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very nice shirt jacket and what a great invention by the ...,5,"Very nice shirt jacket and what a great invention by the way! Very classy, warm, and a great fit for my husband. I bought him the tobacco and it is a beautiful dark brown. It has these great side pockets I like to put my hand in! 😊  and a nice sized pocket on the inside. Perfect for MN fall with a base layer. He is 5'9"" 175 and the large fit nicely. Arrived on time with fine packaging.Great purchase."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Cheap,2,"Very thin, not a tough jacket like expected. 3rd time I wore it the jacket ripped by the right pocket just from hanging my hands in the pockets."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Quality garment,5,"This garment is amazing. My husband goes out in the woods, hunts, gets dirt rubbed all over it from reaching into the back of the truck, etc. the first just brushes off!It handles snow pretty well, layers nicely under his outdoor vests, and is sturdy."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great coat/jacket,5,"This is a great jacket that I have been using since I have got it. It's been a little warm around Pittsburgh lately, but is now starting to cool off. This works well even in colder weather with a good sweater to go with it, I wouldn't recommend wearing it in colder weather with just a t-shirt. It fits great and has a nice look to it.ProsGreat coatFits wellLooks nice enoughConsFront pockets for you hands seem to sit maybe just a little far back, and I have longer arms, but not a deal breaker, I wear it several times a week."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,This jacket is big man friendly,5,"A gift for my Dad who is a big man. Usually wears a 4XL, and this was the perfect size even a little baggy but that’s his style so he loved it. It’s perfect for outdoors or a party. It’s a great jacket for the price."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Nice Jacket,5,Nice jacket. Exactly what I wanted.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Awkward pockets,3,"This is a good piece as an over layer, just know that the pockets are at the side seams.  It makes for an awkward go of it to try to put your hands in your pockets. Otherwise, it was well received."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Looks soooooooo much cooler in the pictures,3,"Looks soooooooo much cooler in the pictures than in person. Sent it back. If it was $30 I would have kept it, but it wasn't."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Not as advertised...,1,"Expensive, but the quality seems ok. The issue I have is that I ordered the Tarmac color that comes with red quilting on the inside and a RED collar to match the quilting. However, this shirt came with an ORANGE collar and doesn’t look right with the red quilting. For as expensive as the shirt is, you’d think they could get the details right...SMH"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"True to size, this is a tall, long sleeved, good looking, comfortable, well fitting jacket.",5,Finally a true tall jacket.  The body and sleeves are very long and it fit just right.  Was pleased with the quality and how nice it looked.  Well worth the money and nearly as warm as my winter coat.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Not good,1,Doesn't look like photo at all and I got a size Large and it's more like an extra large
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Quality product,5,"Nice quality shirt/jacket. Washes well, fits good and looks great !"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Weird sizing!!!$,3,"I bought a medium and it was way too big, I returned it for a small and that was way too small/tight I returned it for a refundI really liked the feel and look of the jacket I’m bummed it didn’t fit 😞😞😞"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,really great quality,5,really nice looking. just like the pictures
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great quality,5,Very nice light weight jacket ! Great to wear out and put under a jacket for warmth. Does run a little large
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great fit,5,I love this on my hunny and he likes it as well. Its a little stiff at first but after a few hours it was good.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Good shirt bad snaps,4,Love these shirts for work but the open snap buttons on this shirt wont stay snapped. Bad design I guess . Was surprised.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),It even looks pretty good on little old fat guys.,5,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   I'm happy with my purchase. When I bought mine (from amazon.com), it was about $12 cheaper for some reason. Even at the current price, though (about $35), it's a good buy.Anyway, please see my video review.Oh, just for reference, I'm about 5'5"" = 165cm tall (or short, depending on how you view things)."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Fit For My Body Size,5,"Plenty of good things have already been said about this jacket which I agree with, so I won't bore you by repeating them here.  My only concern isn't about the product so much, but about how descriptive reviews concerning the fit often fail to describe the person that's wearing the jacket.  To say it's a ""great fit"", ""too long"", ""too tight,"" etc., is worthless unless the reader knows more about the wearer's body.  So here goes . . . I bought a Large size jacket.  I'm 5'10"", at 202 lbs, and have slightly long arms.  (A 34"" sleeve shirt sleeve ends the cuffs near perfectly, about 3/4 inch below my wrist.)  I mention this because this Large size jacket also fits my arm length perfectly, which might make the sleeves a smidgen long for men with more average length arms. (Probably not a big deal tho, as the cuff's snaps should stop the sleeves from sliding into your hand.)  Believe my shoulder and chest width is about average for my height, and the jacket fits well there too, with some jacket slack.  Am happy with the general length of this Large size, but (alas!) I've got a fairly significant gut which makes zipping the jacket a tight fit in that area, so, I'll likely just wear it unzipped, which is rarely a problem in Albuquerque's mostly warm temperatures.  Hope this more descriptive info provides some extra help in figuring out the best size for your order.  PS - Just have to add that the jacket really is a quality buy for the $$$ and ""free"" returns removes any real sizing anxiety."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Say It's Name. London Fog.,5,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   I bought this specifically for impersonating the Walter White character. I am a medium to slim  build guy, very average body type. This fits perfectly. The color is Camel. Washed and machine dried, no issues. Money well spent for the purpose I wanted it for.I'm 6'0"", 180 lbs. I take a 40 Long Sports coat or suit jacket. So you can see how this jacket fits me by comparison.UPDATE: Bought my third one, in black this time. Heisenberg - ""Breaking Bass"""
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great price for the quality,5,"I was looking for a lightweight jacket for spring, fall and warmer winter days. I have lived in Boise, Id for 10 years and have not seen below zero yet.The jacket is very well made, no loose stitches or threads hanging out. The style  is quite nice, more than just a casual jacket. Very nice attention to detail and finish. It has partial elastic waist bands, shoulder expansion pleats, 7 pockets!!! (3 inside with Velcro closure, (4) outside, 2 with zippers and 2 open for quick access.After seeing this jacket in person and wearing it, I ordered one in Brown. I have spent money on things that were well below my expectations but, this jacket has far exceeded my expectations. I have included a pic of the inside of the jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good As A Packable Jacket,4,"I needed a lightweight jacket that would pack well, had some rain resistance and would match up with a white shirt and black slacks (work attire).  Although not perfect, this London Fog fills the need pretty well.  It has sold well and has, at last glance, over 1700 reviews so lots of details are out there.  Here are my pros and cons:Pros:True to size fit. I am 5'11' and 190lbs. The fit is very comfortable and even has some room for light layering.Packs well and resists wrinkling.Lots of pockets, including three inside that secure with hook and loop fasteners.  Big enough to actually be useful.Bi-swing back provides a wide and comfortable range of movement.Quality workmanship throughout.Cons:Not a ""true"" black, I'd call it a dark, matte charcoal.  Close enough but could be better.Elastic around the waistband tends to cause the waist ride up with movement and stay there, giving a very ""blousy"" look.For the price, fit and workmanship the jacket is five stars.  The two ""cons"" knock it down one star."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very comfortable soft everyday water resistant jacket made well.,4,"Feel inside is great..Very comfortable. The coat is not heavy in weight.  The XL fits around my 5-10 230LB belly. It is light- its a golf coat. For me, its good to 40-45°. But you can wear it inside like when at the store and not overheat.  The BEST part is the 2 ea. dual front pockets.  There are really 4 pockets on front.  2 have zipper closures so your phone doesn't fall out.,.the other 2 are good for your hands.  Also 2 inside breast pockets and 1 little pocket down low inside. The jacket does not restrict your motion- you really could use this golfing!They have elastic around waist-Good. The cuffs are button closures- too bad they have no elastic in the cuff.  I usually have to unsnap the cuffs to take off the coat past my hands. Then put the coat back on and snap the cuffs back. But once on, the cuffs feel good.Weak points  (1) Gray material  under collar.  Should be black like the coat..It is not seen when  collar is down as you would normally wear coat. (2) a bit of static electricity in material. I need to wash it with fabric softener or some other anti-static treatment.Wish list? A little elastic in cuff and maybe a light weight water resistant  hood tucked into the collar. The microfiber outer is Water resistant."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Perfect But Pay Attention to the Sizing Comments,5,"First a BIG THANK YOU to all who wrote about the long sleeve length and fuller body fit. I am 6'3"", 230lbs with a 34"" waist and routinely wear an XL. Based on other's comments regarding the sleeves running long, I bought this in Large. It fits perfectly!! Plenty of great pockets, functional and well placed. The extra shoulder flexibility makes arm movement easier. The black I ordered sure looks as black as my other black coats.This is exactly the light weight jacket I was looking for.  I thought the price was great and could not be happier with the purchase."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Exactly the jacket I was looking for (once I got the right size),4,"I originally purchased a medium, because that's what I usually wear, but it fit more like a large.  So I returned it and purchased a small, and it fits perfectly.  This is a really nice jacket.  Not fussy.  Very soft and comfortable -- with plenty of pockets.  Besides two inside  pockets with velcro tabs, it also has an third inside pocket for cell phone or even a wallet, with a velco closure and a flap. Outside has four(!) pockets: two open ones to tuck your hands, and, inconspicuously behind them, two zippered ones for your stuff.  The jacket is not stiff at all.  It's a the right weight for spring or fall. Made in Vietnam."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent light jacket,5,"In my area it's only really cold a few days of the year.  While I own several coats and jackets that keep me warm during those few times, they are too warm the rest of the time.  I needed something light, something to keep off a chill while holding off the wind and the occasional light mist.  Enter two great choices:  The London Fog Auburn Jacket and the Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket.  Both jackets were available from Amazon at reduced prices so I bought both.  The bottom line is I like both and I'm keeping both.  Both are similar and both are winners.  My advice is to buy based on color and cost because you can't really lose.The Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket differs from the Auburn Jacket by having knit cuffs and bottom edge.  The Auburn Jacket has elastic in the bottom edge and the cuffs snap closed.  I have no preference either way.  The outer fabric of both is microfiber polyester (whatever happened to poly/cotton twill, I wonder).  Both feel like the same weight and look like they could have been cut from the same bolts of cloth except for the colors.  The liners are a little different with the Weatherproof being slightly heavier but in no way bulky or thick.  The Auburn has a lighter feeling fabric inside.  Again, I have no preference either way.  Fit-wise they are very much alike.  The Weatherproof is a little longer in the body than the Auburn when the Auburn is bought in standard sizes.  Personally, I probably should have gotten the tall size of the Auburn but reviews indicated the Auburns sleeves are a bit too long and tall sizes usually have even longer sleeves.  I'm almost exactly six feet tall with a long torso so I can usually go either standard or tall without either seeming off.  I ordered the Auburn in standard length and it's okay but just a tad short.  However, I wouldn't want the sleeves to be any longer.  The Weatherproof fits me perfectly in length and the sleeves are okay too--not as long as those on the Auburn.  I ordered XXL in both jackets and I cannot detect any difference in the fit around the chest or waist.  They're roomy enough in my case for wearing a heavy sweater if need be.  I've worn them with thick sweatshirts but nothing heavier.I've worn both jackets in 45F weather but not in the rain.  Both cut the wind well.  I don't expect either to be waterproof like my Eddie Bauer rain parka.  Probably fine for a light mist or a quick shower.  What I find so great about these jackets is that they're comfortable over a wide range of temperatures.  I can wear one while driving without having to deal with the bulk of a heavier coat and I can wear it indoors for extended periods without feeling overheated.  Even on cold days, I usually only need a jacket for those times I'm outdoors between buildings or from the car to a building.  I only need a really warm coat when I'm outside for more than a few minutes.Which to buy?  Both are great.  I have a tan London Fog Auburn and a light blue Weatherproof Classic Golf.  Both colors will coordinate and match with other colors fine.  The London Fog has more color choices here on Amazon so that might be a factor.  My decision was made based on price.  At the time I bought both jackets, the prices were at a low point and both jackets were bargains.EDIT 01/18/2019:I've worn both these jackets for a while now and I have to give the edge to the London Fog.  That's based on a couple of things about the Weatherproof that wasn't evident at first.  Mainly it has to do with the knit cuffs on the Weatherproof.  In a very short time, they are beginning to pill on the right side of my jacket.  I'm not sure this speaks well for the quality of the fabric for the longterm.  Another thing I did not notice early on is that the cuffs on the Weatherproof do not match.  The left cuff's knit is different from the right.  This might explain the pilling of the right cuff.  However, I admit I like the way the knit cuffs fit compared to the snap cuffs of the London Fog.  On the London Fog, the cuffs feel either too tight or too loose, depending on which snap I use."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent Light-weight Jacket,5,"I had been looking for a wind-breaker style jacket for a while in navy and ran across this on amazon. I own other London Fog coats and jackets so I knew the quality would be there without question. And, it is. Being able to purchase it at a great discount on amazon (with quick delivery, I might add) was a great plus.There are four exterior pockets, one on top of the other on each side. The ""top"" pockets are zippered, which is a very nice feature, as I seem to use them a lot. No more having smaller items fall out. There are three interior pockets. Two are actually pretty spacious and are top open access, one left and one right, and secured with velco. The final, lower left side, has a flap, again with Velcro. And there have been times I have used all of them.The material is soft and feels good when wearing. The adjustable snap cuff is an added bonus. The jacket is well-made with good London Fog attention to detail. Two snaps on the sleeve to fit probably any size arm. Sometimes, I even unsnap them, depends on the look I want. As of this writing, my jacket looks exactly as pictured on amazon.Make no mistake. This is not for extreme winter wear. I bought it for spring and fall use, as well as the occasional crisp summer nights. It is perfect for that use. It has even kept me very dry in rain, including some pretty heavy downpours. The microfiber dries out fairly quickly. I have not had any issues with wrinkling.I am quite pleased with, and highly recommend, this jacket. So much so, that I also purchased one in black."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Nice mid-weight old-school jacket,5,"25 years ago, I bought a beautifully made golf jacket in a Van Heusen outlet in Kittery Maine, and I'm still wearing it. It refuses to wear out, but is too stained to keep wearing in public. It will now become my yard work coat.I shopped long and hard for a replacement. I love Carhartt, but they too heavy and stiff. I love Columbia, but they're too light and fragile. Others have way too many cargo pockets. And I hate hoodies.Out of the blue, Amazon recommended the London Fog golf jacket, which is just the right mid-weight and old-school styling. It has a real collar that lays flat or flips up to protect you from the wind.It has three inside pockets for my smartphone, wallet, and note pad. I love that each on the two outside pockets has a zippered area to secure my keys plus an unzipped area for warming my hands. Finally the back has a pleate over each shoulder blade to give you room to swing a golf club or do manual labor. My only complaint is that it needs a slightly heavier lining.I bought a large in the titanium color, which was illustrated on the website as dark gray but arrived as light gray. I like the color so I've kept it and bought another in green. They won't last as long as my old Van Heusen, but I should get a couple of decades of wear anyway."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),A tried and true brand comes through,5,"I had been looking for a golf jacket/windbreaker for a few weeks. I didn't want to go overboard on price, so that limited the search somewhat. I was disappointed by a lot of cheaply made options. I'm a big guy, so needed to get an extended size. This one, by London Fog, hit it out of the park.That is one plus (extended size ranges) London Fog has over many other vendors. The fit is very good. I have a gut, and the waist and front close comfortably around me. I worried about some reviews complaining about the length, but the jacket fits like a golf jacket should, at least on me. If you have a long torso, it may feel short.It looks like it's made well, with tight, even seams. The fabric is a brushed polyester that looks and feels more substantial than the name polyester evokes. It has a mesh lining, and snap closures on the sleeves. There are 4 pockets discreetly on the outside (two of them with zip closure) and three on the inside.  It has a plastic zipper, but a good quality. If I had to fault anything, I would prefer a metal zipper.But the jacket looks and feels good on me. Most importantly, it really is a wind breaker, and has been keeping me comfortably warm on blustery March days in the 40s here in New England. (Note: I am wearing a t-shirt and sweatshirt underneath.)Years ago, as a teenager, I needed a decent raincoat to wear over a suit. The clerk at our local department store pointed out London Fog as a quality label. It proved true then, and holds true today in my opinion."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Great Fit, great pockets, great quality.",5,"Great jacket.  The outside pockets had a cool surprise.  They're dual.  There's a zipper pocket (for a keyless entry key), and then a standard pocket (for salt packets at a movie theater perhaps).Then the inside pockets.  While they're not zippered like I hoped, there are 2 on left side, and 1 on right side.  All 3 inside have a velcro tab. The bigger pocket on each side can hold Galaxy S9+ (in an otter box) if you put the phone sideways.The smaller pocket inside... while they're not big enough to velcro close with an iPhone 7 (with rubber case), the smaller pocket will hold a  wallet EASILY.The smaller pocket inside could also hold a hardened glasses case too, but I didn't try that yet.So it pretty much can hold all your stuff well, securely, and look sharp.So I just ordered two other colors.  My XL fits great for 187 lbs with room in shoulders.  I suspect it could easily accommodate a sweatshirt or sweater too.But I also ordered a L because I think the sizing feels 'versatile' and if I want a lean-cut look, I bet it would work.This jacket looks sharp, seems to be a great quality windbreaker (probably because its London Fog), and will work GREAT for work and holding my stuff in a car, plane, or movie theater.  Great job.  ThanksPS I'm around 5'11 and 190.  I think i accidentally clicked ""3 feet"" for my height, but can't seem to fix it."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),LOVE IT!!!!!,5,"I have had this jacket for a month now and it immediately became my favorite light jacket. It has two inside pockets (vs. 1 that most coats have), has dual hand pockets on each side (one zippered one not, which is very handy), it is very comfortable, the interior is lined with a material that helps it slide on and off easily without catching my shirt via friction (rare coat in this regard), it isn't too hot (a problem with most of my coats), and I find that I can wear it outside then come inside and somehow I'm comfortable in both temperatures (right now its December in Denver, CO), it has an elasatic waistband but it isnt tight and doesnt ride up, it doesnt wrinkle much and the wrinkles come out fast on their own. The only problem is that my wife thinks it looks too nice to wear to work (I'm a general contractor) because she doesnt want me to get it dirty, but she's fine with me wearing coats that cost twice as much, lol. I'll have to tell her that its not expensive.This kind of light coat is PERFECT for me, and I had one years ago but can never find it in stores. Finally I searched online for hours until I located this one, and it is every bit as good as I had hoped it would be. I like the quality too (I am a stickler about things being good quality). The zipper is sturdy, and the tassle on it is very helpful. I did manage to get the little flap that runs along the zipper caught in the zipper once, which alarmed me, but it came back out easily enough.I didn't come on here to give a review, I actually came back here to order another coat (different color), partly because I'm scared that they'll stop making this coat and I want a backup, lol. Thats how much I like it!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Nice jacket but you may want to size down,5,"This is a nice jacket. The feels like microfiber and it appears to be of very nice quality. There are the two ""slash"" pockets outside as seen in the photo and three inside. Two are quite sizeable - good for your cellphone, and the other is smaller - good for the key fob for your car.I usually am a medium in everything I try on in the stores, but it seems like things I get from Amazon (at least the jackets) are one size too large. I ordered both sizes suspecting this would be the case here and sure enough it was. The small fits me well except it's just a little tighter in the waist then I like it (I have a 31"" waist. The rest of it fits perfect.The jacket works with jeans or casual Fridays - basically a classic design. I like it."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Fits great! Nice jacket!,5,"I wore this to go out, immediately after trying it on. I'm a big guy- 250 pounds, and 6'-2"" tall. I have a pretty good sized 70 year old guy gut, too. This XL is perfect for me, or someone of similar size. It's really thin, which I wanted- with an inside vented material... seemingly for sweat/ moisture absorption. There are several inside pockets, two main pockets, and one smaller one... all have velcro closures... and I need that.The color is a really nice rich dark brown. This is exactly what I was hoping it would be. It's reasonably priced, too. Recommended!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Look out for returns,1,"The first of these I ordered had a defective (or just plain cheap) zipper. It would zip up but wouldn't zip down except with extraordinary effort (pliers helped).  I returned it and got a replacement a couple of days later. Except this time, what I got had been returned* by someone else, probably because they saw the spots on the front of the jacket, too. It appears that Amazon will try to resell something defective that had been returned.Zipper worked, though.* The ""ready to ship"" bag had been torn open, just like I had done with the first one."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Not that happy with this item,1,"The fit was about as expected, maybe slightly short..could use another inch or two of length on the body.I have two problems with the item.There are two overlapping side pockets on each side - one with a zipper, and one without. Nice concept but the zippered pockets jam up every time I try to open or close them.Second issue - the lining in the sleeve ripped loose the 2nd time I put the jacket on...terrible construction. Based on this, I can't recommend the product.UPDATE: the first rip was up high in the left arm sleeve, near where my arm goes in. A few weeks later it ripped down low in the same sleeve, so now I have two chances to catch my arm on the lining every time I put it on. This jacket is poorly constructed, which is too bad because I like the basic exterior material. But now I REALLY don't recommend it, and I've downgraded it an additional notch, to one star. Wish I had returned it right away when it ripped loose right after I got it."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Color slightly different,4,"Excellent jacket, I usually order medium size, but in other brand jackets medium size is too big for me, especially the sleeves, Amazon was out of medium size, so I took a chance on small.  It turned out the right size for me with one exception, which is not a big deal, seems like the waste band is a bit more aggressive in elasticity than most.  I'd say it's me, but there's a lot left to pull out, so it's just a strong elastic.  Not a biggie.  The reason for one less star, I chose the Pacific blue color.  What I received was closer to a peacock blue, leaning more toward turquoise, especially in certain lighting.  It's still a rich blue and I like it enough to keep, but was a bit surprised.  Will be just right for fall travel."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Best jacket EVER!!!,5,"1) Pockets all over the place - pockets IN pockets!2) Both external pockets (the ones where you would naturally put your hands) actually have TWO pockets each, and one on each side has a zipper!3) Microfiber, or whatever it is, does not wrinkle and makes NO ""whoosh whoosh"" sound when you're walking,4) Gentle elastic at waist hugs the waist and looks good without being too tight and riding up5) Easy on/off without fighting it (had a heck of a time with a Columbia jacket in this area)6) Lightweight fabric is perfect for Spring/Fall.  I'd wear it down to 40/45-degrees Fahrenheit.7) I'm nearly 56 years old, this is probably the best jacket I've ever owned (sad, isn't it, how excited I get over these things, huh?), but my 20-something year-old coworkers have asked me where I got this jacket and a couple have gotten one."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Five stars..BUT Beware of size reviews!!!,5,"I'm 6'3"" and weigh 240 lbs. Mostly every review said this jacket runs big and to ""order a size down"". I normally wear a 2xl in every shirt and jacket that I own so I ordered an XL Tall in this jacket and it was definitely too small. The jacket itself is very light and beautiful with plenty of pockets which is why I ordered it! 😄.  It was too snug in the chest/belly areas but I'm sending this back for a 2 XL Tall. Sleeves were perfect though so I'm expecting them to be slightly long on the 2 XL Tall but that's okay.. this jacket is worth it.  Just a heads-up for the bigger guys out there!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Just what I was looking for,5,"This jacket is very nice quality for the price and just what I was looking for. I wanted a lightweight jacket I could wear on cool mornings, evenings, or even at work because of the cold a/c but not something too bulky to cary around if not needed. After reading the reviews, I was concerned about the fit but I went with my gut and stayed with my normal size (L). I am 5'9"" / 180lbs / 34 waist and the jacket fits just right around waist, chest, and arm length. The number of pockets is an added bonus and the other pockets have zippers. The only negative has nothing to do with the jacket. It has to do with the shipping. It was delivered in a white clothing bag so the jacket was jammed in there and was very wrinkled. No big deal but just FYI. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and might buy another in a different color."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),LONDON FOG MEN'S AURBURN ZIP-FRONT GOLF JACKET (REGULAR & BIG-TALL SIZES),5,"I was going to buy the rust colored Jacket but they did not have my size, so I bought the AURBURN, and I am very happy with it. It fits great and has zipper pockets and regular pockets too. Really nice to have all those pockets. Especially the one for your cell phone and it closes at the top so you can not lose it or fall out of your Jacket. NOW THEY CAN SEE ME COMING DOWN THE STREET AS BRIGHT AS A ROSE, AND ROSES ARE MY FOVORITE FLOWER, AND MY MOTHERS TOO, BUT NOW SHE IS LIVING WITH JESUS. I WILL SEE HER AGAIN. (I WANT TO GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN AND PETS TOO, AND THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR YOU TOO. James D. North"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very good jacket with plenty of pockets,5,"Most of my cloths are 3X, some are 2X so I purchased the 3X version if this jacket.  Let me tell you from a big mans perspective that the 3X is more like a 4 -5X.  Even the sleeves extend 6 inches past my hand.On the other hand, the jacket is made very well and has a good feel to it so I ""bit the bullet""  and went and purchased the 2X.  It fits perfectly and looks very good on me.  There are pockets everywhere (inside and outside). The outside has 2 zippered and 2 open pockets.Overall I highly recommend this product, just select the correct size."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Slightly nicer than the 3 jackets I compared it to,5,"Slightly nicer than the 3 other jackets I compared it to from Amazon (and returned), so I bought it, despite its being a bit more expensive.  Very simple, no gimmicks.  Nice, informal look.  I preferred it over 2 others that had fairly stiff fabric, which might have shown fewer wrinkles and might have been more rain-proof, but this one was almost equally wrinkle-free.  Note that this is only for cool, not cold, weather, since it has little in the way of insulation.  I especially like the 2 snaps at the bottom of each of the sleeves, which (when I use the inner snaps) prevent the sleeves from going down much further than my wrist--otherwise, the sleeves would be too long, as all the jackets I've checked out all are, for my 34"" arms at least."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Not for me,3,"This jacket seems to be well made but perhaps because I got it in black the soft suede feeling material picks up lint like crazy and even came with light white marks where the jacket had been folded in shipment that did not come out.  The marks weren't apparent unless you looked at it up close but wherever I placed the jacket unless I brushed off the lint that sure was apparent and the jacket was very wrinkly.  The style also just did not suit me.  I am a 50 year old man but still found the styling of this jacket to be the look of an ""old man"" jacket.  I considered trying it in another color but with the extra long sleeves and not quite right fit in the chest I decided to return it and keep using my regular old spring jacket for now till I find one I truly like.  A light spring/fall jacket should be a no thought purchase that provides that added layer of warmth when needed without being a hassle to maintain."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very Nice Jacket.,5,"This jacket is well worth the price I paid. I love that it has a ton of pockets with most of them either zippered or secured by Velcro.  My large Galaxy Note 9 with leather case fits securely in the inner breast pocket. The color (Navy) comes exactly as pictured.  It zips and unzips easily with no snags.  The material feels soft and comfortable.  The jacket seemed to fit a bit looser than I had expected, but may be because I recently lost about 30 lbs. and am in the middle of a Large and Medium  I would think that a Medium would be too tight for me though.  I am 5' 10"" and 155 lbs. I cannot vouch for it being rain proof yet.I would say that it seems to be a great deal for a quality look and feel jacket, and I would recommend this to any guy desiring a lightweight classic look jacket for Spring or Fall."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"The color is not as per picture on iPad screen, looks “warn”. Scratches the wrists.",1,"The color is not as per picture on iPad screen, looks warn couple of years even it is obviously new. Scratches the wrists, the tic-tack buttons are not mounted property. Seriously thinking of returning it, so far the first product to consider returning from Amazon.In addition inside pockets are not deep enough to hold my 5.5” pixel xl cell phone and lock the Velcro at the top, zip would have done better job.Note to designers - please consider today’s electronics sizes, not the decade old and I am an old fashioned guy who does not like looking like somebody that just got out of the dumpster, when I buy “espresso” i’d like to look like my espresso beans or as pictured on sRGB screen, being the most common."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Too Short,2,"I am 5'10, which is pretty average height, and 180, an average weight. This jacket was well priced and I ordered it, but it was short in the waist. Skimpy is how I'd describe it. A longer one cost a lot more money, so the net effect was correcting my misconception of London Fog from a premium American made brand, as well as my misconception that there is a price for products relating to what they cost to make and market. A little research confirmed that the London Fog name was sold to Herman Kay, making apparel factory in the Dominican Republic. I bought a Columbia windbreaker which fit well, and was from a company which had a good product for a good price. Columbia manufactures in where it's cheap, too, with the biggest output from Vietnam. But the clothes aren't cheaply made."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),True sizing,5,Nice lightweight and full of pockets.Perfect jacket for travel or the chilly Florida days we encounter fr a brieft time yearly.True to size...I always order XL to leave room for sweaters and like a loose fit!The CAMEL is a darker camel than the pcitures shown..more of a true dark beige with yellow undertones.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Classic London Fog 'look', fit and quality. Really nice gentlemen's light jacket",5,"I'm in my mid-60's, and wanted something other than a hoodie for cooler or wet weather in the fall and spring. This jacket is perfect! Unlike so many former American brands that are now manufactured in other countries, this jacket has the classic London Fog fit across the shoulders and arm pits. No binding.The fabric is very attractive, the construction is solid and the style is conservative but timeless. Maybe not something to wear at Coachella...but, just right for a trip to the local pub ;-)"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great jacket!,5,"Bought this jacket because I was traveling overseas for a spring vacation. Kept me comfortable in 50 degree weather, also kept the wind and rain off. It has several interior pockets where I kept my passport, wallet, phone, boarding passes, etc. Had no worries about any of those items being stolen. The only complaint I have is that sometimes with the outside zippered pockets, the fabric would get stuck in the zippers, which was cumbersome to fix. Otherwise its a great light-to-medium weight jacket and I am very pleased with the purchase."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Really nice, light jacket",5,"I specifically bought this for the London Fog label as they have had decades of experience.  The jacket arrived quickly and is really a nice, lightweight jacket for chilly weather.  The fabric has a nice, soft feel to it and the fit is exactly as expected.  I have been losing weight and needed a lightweight jacket smaller than XL and above.  I ordered this in large.  It provides enough room to accommodate a light sweater underneath.  I also like the fact that the cuffs are NOT elastic (which I think tends to stretch out over time).It's a really good value for the money.  I highly recommend it."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Nice jacket - watch sizing,4,"I really like this jacket. I ordered an XL, my usual goto size. It's a bit tight around my waist (42"") but not a dealbreaker. It zips up and doesn't look stupid. I have short arms, so I hate jackets that hang down over my hands. (I also have a short inseam on my legs (29"" - I'm 5'11""), so I'm used it it, but don't like it. I'm not a mutant, btw lol) Anyway, I really like the jacket. Only other gripe would be the Velcro on the large inside pockets. I like to be able to just slide stuff in there without having to mess with the Velcro."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),FINALLY found a windbreaker that works!,5,"Have bought three or four cheaper windbreakers in the last 2 years,  A fleece-lined one was impossible to get on and off if wearing a sweatshirt, never mind a sweater, due to friction.  Another one had a zipper that snagged the lining 3 times out of 5.  Third one had velcro pocket closures that were a PITA to open, along with the fore-mentioned faults.  All have been handed off to the Sally Army, virtually unworn.This London Fog scores five stars on all parameters.  I expect years of wear out of it."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Looking Jacket,5,"I bought this jacket for my father.  He loved it.  It is a really nice material and the color of a tan to off white went with everything.  He wore it everywhere.  He was a small size and lost a lot of weight.  I got him a small and it fit him very well.  If you are thinking about buying this jacket I would say do it.  It is one thing I was very happy I bought off line.  The quality was very nice.  I bought this for my dad last year.  He passed away last month.  But, it is one item of clothing I can say I bought him that he had on almost all the time living in GA."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),great jackey,5,"I really like the Jacket.  I'm 6'2"", 175 lbs and chose the large size which fits perfectly.  Has plenty of pockets both inside and out.  Both outer left and right side has two pockets, sort of one pocket on top of the other with the bottom ones having a zipper to keep contents from falling out.  There are 3 interior pockets, one large on both sides and a smaller pocket on the left side for keys or a small wallet.  The interior pockets all use Velcro to keep the pockets shut.  Its a good buy"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),London Fog always and still lives up to its name!,5,"Beautiful jacket and gave to my husband for Father's Day.  Got the Navy in an XL and it fit him perfectly.... I don't know his exact measurements but he's 6', roughly 215 lbs. (Incidentally and FYI, the navy IS a very dark navy...  more darker than most navy shades if that makes sense).  His BD is coming up in a couple months and am ordering another color or two....  nice looking jacket that could be worn casual or with slacks as well.  Very happy!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),London Fog golf jacket,4,"The Jacket is a nice quality feeling lightweight jacket. I'm 6'1"" at 320,  I ordered the 4XL big, with my 58"" chest it fits perfect, the length is at my belt, so if I bend over I have to pull the jacket back down when I straighten back up. This fits kind of like a Bomber Jacket, with comfy hand pockets on each side. Jacket has plenty of room in the arm pits to not be binding, with the arm length just a little long and adjustable cuffs, perfect so arms don't get binding on full movement."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Nice Style, Nice Fit",5,"I first bought a Weatherproof jacket at a department store, but it had puffy sleeves reminiscent of the nineties and a button misplaced on the collar and a tight band at the bottom that caused the jacket to balloon out around the mid-section. Overall, it was a bad fit. The London Fog is a much better style and fit. Three inside pockets will keep a phone, keys, and wallet dry. It's lightweight and easy to wash. A bargain for the price. The only negative I noticed is the microsuede texture of the material seems to pick up a lot of dust from surfaces."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Much Too Warm for Spring or Summer,2,"I wanted to replace my husband's old Nautica golf jacket, which he loves but is getting shabby looking.  He wears it when the temperature goes over 75 degrees to give himself some sun protection.  It is very light and unlined, so it's ideal for weather up into the high 80s.  It seems to be impossible to find an unlined jacket anymore, or a light one.  This jacket is heavy and very warm.  He said it would be great for days under 60 degrees, but he has several for cool weather.  Returned it.  If anyone knows where to find a LIGHT, COOL jacket please say so in the comments."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Wrinkles from packaging are a big problem with this one.,3,"The jacket arrived with wrinkles in the left sleeve area. I ran it through a rinse cycle and then dried it according to the label.  The wrinkles themselves actually came out but the spots where the wrinkles were are darker than the surrounding fabric. So it still kind of looks wrinkled. Coloring may even out over time. I don't know. Also a lighter colored jacket may not have this problem.  It would've been a good buy, price wise if it weren't for the wrinkle problem."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"RIDICULOUSLY short for a ""big and tall"" item",1,"Look, I'm definitely a fat guy.  However, I can wear 4X jackets from Columbia just fine, and even 3X from other manufacturers.So I buy a 4X of this London Fog jacket... and I look like mid-1990's Britney Spears!  It literally hangs ABOVE my belly button!  If you're selling jackets at sizes up to 4X and even 5X, then you know your customers have guts.  So why cut those garmets for bare midriffs?I'm not even mad.  It was hearty laugh.  But this is certainly a return."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Just what I wanted,5,"My wife and I lived in South America for over a decade and I had a London Fog jacket all during that time period and I really liked it's function and fit.  We returned to the States without it and I have wanted to replace it for the past 5 years.  I was very happy to find the same London Fog jacket here on Amazon in the exact color (Cement).  I liked the color because I always felt like I was dressed up and yet casual.  We were a little worried about buying it online without being able to try it on, but followed the order instructions.  I couldn't be happier with the fit when it arrived because it was ...just what I wanted!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Nice Lightweight Jacket,4,"Overall, it's a good jacket.  I needed a lightweight one that looked good and had plenty of pockets.  It fit those needs quite well.  I have to agree with another reviewer that it came somewhat wrinkled.  After a week of hanging, it hasn't settled itself, and even the collar turns up a bit (kind of a pet peeve of mine)  I may try washing it to see if that helps.  The price could be a bit lower, but I would buy it again, as I like the London Fog brand, style, fit and quality."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"features the greatest number of pockets, both inside and out, of any high-end golf jacket available today",4,"London Fog sold these high-end golf jackets both under their own label and under the Stafford label for JCPenney, where you may rest assured that both are in fact the same jacket. Please be aware, however, that there are several VERSIONS of the same jacket being made available today.Okay, what I am about to offer to you next is a trifle confusing, but here goes.Some of the Auburn jackets feature the outer 'slash' style hand pockets being situated on the INSIDE of the zippered pockets, whereas in some of the other Auburn jackets, they are situated on the OUTSIDE of the zippered pockets. If you are using these pockets to store your gear, AND this feature is important to you, then skip the online shopping process entirely and try on the jacket in person at one of your local Carson, Macy or JCPenney stores.Additionally, the 'old' version of the Auburn jacket featured two inside pockets that were so darn small, that they were barely suitable to carry anything larger than an iPod or cell phone. The 'new' version of the Auburn jacket comes equipped with two inside pockets that are large enough to carry larger and more bulky items such as earmuffs, golf cap, or even airline tickets and passports.The London Fog Auburn jacket is a tad long in the sleeve - it is designed to be used as a golf jacket after all - BUT if wearing a high-end jacket with a longer sleeve length is an issue, go with the 'Weather-Proof' brand. These two jackets are virtually indistinguishable from each other, however the 'Weather-Proof' jacket comes with a knit cuff, which is consequently a tad shorter, whereas the London Fog jacket comes with a snap cuff, resulting in a fit that will naturally be a tad longer in the sleeve.Also please be aware that indoors, the London Fog Auburn jacket in dark 'Navy' appears almost black. It is not until the jacket is viewed in the direct sunlight that it appears to be dark navy, if that is an issue.The 'Weather-Proof' has the nicest tailoring of any mens' golf jacket. Millionaire attorneys wear them, but bear in mind that they always have caddies nearby just to lug stuff around for them.The London Fog is still a nice jacket, but it features the greatest number of pockets, both inside and out, of any high-end golf jacket available today, so if you are like me and have to carry your own stuff around, bear that in mind."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very nice light weight jacket with good features,4,"I read the reviews and decided to purchase this jacket.  I'm very happy with it.  I like the double pockets, the fit including the shoulder feature which gives extra relaxed movement and it's very light weight.  For me for what I wanted it's perfect.  However, I just want to warn others that this is a light weight jacket, not just in actual weight but warmth too.  This is a middle/late spring and early fall jacket.  But for those looking for such a jacket I'd highly recommend this one."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Really nice jacket,5,"I can't find anything I don't like about this jacket.  It has some really nice features, and seems like it has really good build quality.  If you're looking for a lightweight spring jacket that looks nice, this one is a winner.  It has a mesh lining, pockets on the inside, dual pockets for your hands, one set with zippers, one without.  Yokes at the shoulders, and snaps at the wrist. I'm very impressed with this jacket, especially for the price.  Just what I was looking for and happy to find it in my size, 3XL tall.  6'6"", 280 lbs, and it fits me perfectly.  Thumbs up."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great All The Way Around!,5,"This is just a perfect jacket. It fits exactly right, as for pockets, there are Two Hand pockets on both sides. One that zips shut for security and the other to warm your hands. The quality is as if it was made in the USA and maybe it was! Just Great all the way around!  Buy, you won’t be sorry!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Great Style, Quality & Fit",5,"What a nice jacket.  Love the Sapphire blue color and it fits me perfectly in size M.  Instead of a shipping box it came via a USPS plastic mailer bag and the jacket was sheathed in a sealed clear wrap.  All in all, it was in great condition with minimal wrinkling.My dad wore several London Fog golf windbreaker jackets and top coats, a couple of which he handed down to me and I just finally discarded the last one a few years ago.This is a great jacket and I will soon order a couple more.  Very happy with the style, fit and quality of this product and Amazon's fast and convenient service was the frosting on the cake.  Ordered it on Thur. and received it Sat."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent lightweight jacket,5,"Purchased to replace a longtime favorite 'Field and Stream' jacket that had finally failed and was not repairable. It fit well and with a very light mesh lining, it works well in late spring and early fall. I have not yet tried it in weather so I don't know how well it sheds water. My only disappointment was the limited colors for my size. I wanted to replace tan jacked with a tan jacket but ended up getting a light green."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Good Material, Odd Fit",4,"The body portion of the jacket is somewhat shorter than I would like; this piece of clothing was clearly designed for skinnier people than me. Overall however it is a comfortable, reasonably warm jacket of high quality. It has six pockets; one normal and one zippered layered over each other on either side of the zipper, and more discreet interior pockets inside of the coat itself. You can carry a lot with this thing, though it does make it bulky to do so."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Bit too wide on the shoulders, despite ordering one size smaller then what I normally wear!",3,"I wanted a thin, but durable dressy Jacket.  It is thin, durable, but not so much dressy (better suited for jeans).  I ordered the darker blue, and when I received, it appears more like ashy-black, depending on the light level.  I almost always wear a Large, but since I'm short, I was concerned the sleeves would be too long, so I went with the Medium.  Well, the sleeves were still a bit on the long side, but the second fastener on the sleeves helps out.  The biggest issue I have is that if fits too wide on the shoulders!  I had to take it off and double-check the size as I had ordered Medium, but fits like a large!  Looks kinda bulky on me, mostly on the shoulders (not good for a short, slender guy!)  Length-wise it's perfect (but only if you prefer to tuck your shirts-in)."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Nice Light Weight Jacket,5,"This is a light-weight jacket that easily fits over a sweatshirt to make it good for layering.  It's loose fitting which I like. There are two snap closures at the wrist to adjust the cuffs, or one can easily role up the sleeves if desired.  The length fits me well as do the sleeves.  The pockets are generous enough for my Covid mask and a small bottle of sanitizer, and my hands if it's a bit cool.  Very happy with this jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Just what I  needed & color I wanted.,4,"Fit just like I wanted for a short rotund old guy except sleeves were longer than expected. But, I like these adjustable snap button cuffs instead of the elastic kind (made clothing difficult for me to get off and on easily).The color on this jacket is my favorite. Like all the pockets. I'm in Florida but my age keeps me feeling cold. This jacket is perfect, not too light yet not too heavy, I feel warm (comfortable) in it.Don't understand the sizing choices? The write up had 4XL 4XL-Tall  Big-4X. I ordered Big-4X and received 4XL which was OK, just don't understand the difference?"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Beautiful and Functional Jacket,5,"Bought this jacket for my boyfriend and he loves it. We used to have a London Fog factory close to us and I have always known about the great quality of their outer wear. The jacket is soft and the inside and outside pockets are wonderful. The outside pockets are really two, one is zippered and one is open. Would highly recommend this jacket. My boyfriend is short with short arms. He is also plump and a d XL worked great for him."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Who did London Fog design this thing for?  Not for me, anyway.",1,"I'm 5'11"" and 195 pounds.  The arm length of the jacket is just right for me.  Jacket is on the heavy side and more of a light winter jacket than any other season.  Fit is on the loose side at the upper arm and upper chest area, on the short side (just below the belt) length-wise, and way too tight at the waist if zippered and will ride up your body and stay there if you raise an arm while zippered.The jacket appears well constructed, but for me it's useless."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),This Isn't Your Dad's London Fog,1,"I expected to receive London Fog, the same jackets, and coats I've been buying for 40 years.  What I got was a wrinkled, cheap looking microfiber product bearing a London Fog label.  This isn't your Dad's London Fog, and neither is it mine.  It's going back."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Can't dry clean!,3,"First time I bought clothes that I wan't in a store.  I figured I'd be safe on a London Fog windbreaker.  Been wearing them for 40 years.  Anyway, this one arrives and fits fine but of course it's wrinkled from packing.  I discover it can't be dry cleaned.  Can only be ironed on low setting.  I don't iron, my wife doesn't iron.  We work.  For us, the dry cleaner irons when they press it.  The whole thing is made of polyester and nylon so I guess that's why.  A lot of people don't iron anymore, they don't have time.  Clothes need to be able to go to the dry cleaner."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Jacket,5,"I bought this as a gift for my 87 yr old dad who has always been very particular about his clothes.  I thought it was a very stylish jacket but was hesitant because I was judging from a photo.  It surpasses the photo of it online.  It is a very well made and beautiful jacket.  The material, style and fit were perfect.  My husband wanted one when he saw the one I had bought for my Dad.  It is perfect for mild weather.  My Dad is cold natured and often is cold in restaurants even in the summer, but this is ideal. It is also water repellent and machine washable."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Buyer beware!,3,"The jacket is well made and stylish, however the color was completely OFF what was pictured in the Amazon ad.  I ordered the ""Cement"" color, which appears almost white on the website.  What I received was a color more like wet, khaki-colored sand, even though the package label read ""Cement.""  I immediately returned it and ordered the ""Poppy"" color instead.  Fingers crossed the second color is accurate."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Loved This Jacket,5,"I was looking to replace a light jacket I had that was getting old and worn looking and had cuffs that were frayed.  I looked for ""windbreakers"" at Amazon and the London Fog jacket came up at the amazingly low price of $19.95 for a black one and the picture looked interesting so I jumped at what I perceived to be a great deal ordering an XL.  I would have ordered an XXL but that was too much of a price jump for me.  It was $79.95 for just the jump to XXL, so I took the chance that XL would be fine.  Well it came and I really like it.  The pockets are fascinating.  They are double side pockets one open and the other zippered on both sides and you also have inside pockets.  It's light weight and comfortable.  I love it.  In fact I loved it so well I went back and ordered one in the cement color so I now have two."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Not for a Slim, Young Man",2,"This jacket was darker red than I was expecting (not a fire engine red, but more dark, maroon). It is waaaay to big if you are trying to fit it on a slim, young guy. My son is 5'10, moderate shoulders, long arms, 117 lbs. The general length of the whole jacket was ok, but it was voluminous in the chest and waist. He was trying to dress iconically like James Dean for a school project, but the jacket color and fit were completely off. Overall, the jacket would still be nice for a bigger guy (but it has some old man vibes). Nice construction and quality materials. I returned, since it didn't fit in sizing or his needs."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great lightweight jacket,5,"Update - Amazon sent a replacement and its perfect: well made, beautiful fabric, fits nicely.  Great for those cool summer mornings and cool fall days. I appreciate that Amazon sent the replacement while the return is in transit.This jacket got two stars because it is a very nice jacket. HOWEVER......the one my husband received was dirty, had a huge oil stain on the front of it and also had animal hair on it. DISGUSTING!!!!! If it has been clean and unworn, it would have been a keeper."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),A nice jacket available in limited sizes,4,"Overall, I like this jacket.  Unfortunately, sizes are limited.  It seems to fit larger than its indicated size.  I ordered a large tall, my usual size for outerwear.  The jacket was way too big in all dimensions.  I returned the jacket for exchange but was disappointed to find that there were no large sizes or medium tall sizes offered.  I settled for a medium.  It's almost right: fine in the shoulders, sleeve length a little short and chest a little tight.  It works OK over a light shirt or tee.  I'll keep it as I like the look and materials.Recommended, but make sure you can get a size that fits you correctly."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Casual jacket for warm weather,4,"Got this for my son who is 5'11"", 170 lbs.  The medium is actually a bit large.  I suspect a small would be too small so he decided to keep it.  Nicely tailored, straight seams and stitching.  The microfiber has a suede-like feel but can show impressions from things laid on it.  Wrinkles but can easily be ironed if that happens.  The interior mesh is nicely stitched and there are two velcro close pockets inside and one additional with a flap close.  The outside pockets are dual - an inner pocket and then the outer zipper pocket.  The back of the neck has a strip of lining which is white with stripes, not the same as the jacket material, if you like to pop your collar (does anyone do that anymore?).  Overall nice quality and I only wish the sizing was a bit better for my son."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Poorly made,1,"The jacket itself is very nice looking and fits perfectly. The issue I have is that the lining inside the left sleeve has already come apart at the seam, and I don’t think it was ever sewn. I just received the jacket yesterday and today is the first time I’ve worn it."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Travel Jacket,5,"I had a very similar jacket that was stolen and I wanted a traveling jacket to replace it. This one fits the bill almost perfectly. I love the soft mirofiber material and the fact that it packs very compactly into my suitcase. It also doesn't wrinkle very badly. I pretty much keep this jacket packed in my traveling suitcase as I travel extensively every month and it's a great all-around jacket unless it is bitterly cold.The only negative that I can think of with the jacket is the inside of the snaps that are on the cuffs can be a little irritating on my wrist if I am wearing a short sleeve shirt. It would be better if the metal was flatter, or even better if it was covered with some fabric.Overall though, I love the jacket.The jacket is not charcoal,  but black."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Nice lightweight jacket,5,"I have rather long arms and this jacket has plenty of arm length.  It also has vents at the upper back giving more room for flexing my arms out and up.  It's lightweight, slips on easily, and just about right when there's a little chill in the air.  The outer fabric has somewhat of a  brushed suede-like texture.  The zipper seems like a good one and overall it appears to be well made.  I liked my black one so much that I ordered a second one in navy. (I think I like black the best.)"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great lightweight casual jacket,5,"I would have returned the jacket for replacement due to a small blemish, but future stock of the item was uncertain, as is the variable price, and it is otherwise perfect. I’m 6’2”, 215lbs, with a 36” waist and fairly long arms, and the large regular fits me like it was tailored. Except for this jacket, I wear extra large (usually tall) or 48 long. The item came nicely packaged, unwrinkled and the light blue is an attractive and versatile color. I’ll keep an eye on the price fluctuations and may buy another!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Perfect,5,I needed a jacket that I could wear to work that isn’t as heavy as my leather coat. This jacket is perfect. It is lightweight and is a comfortable fit. The two pockets on each side was a great surprise. You can put your phone in the zippered pocket and still have a pocket for your hand. It also has two inside pockets. It’s a great jacket.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Poor quality.101,1,"Absolute garbage. It's rare that you buy a new coat and it makes you look like a bum that just  rolled off a park bench, but this is it. Faded color ( black ) and permanent creaeses and wrinkles that even after extended careful ironing ( including spraying water directly on them ) didn't even budge. Maybe their higher end stuff is still good but this item was just sad . Shame on London Fog and Amazon for peddling this crap but I guess that's why it was discounted. Still........"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"This is a good , every day sort of jacket.",5,"This jacket looks good and fits good.  Sometimes the zippers get stuck in the material that is supposed to separate and make way for them as they pass. I wrote a review a couple years ago detailing how this problem led me to almost set myself on fire,  and at least one guy commented that it was one of the funniest things he had read in a long time. I tried to find it today to edit it but apparently somebody was able to persuade  Amazon to make it disappear."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),London Fog L/W Men's Jacket,5,"Just received the jacket via mail this noon. I absolutely love the jacket.  Beautiful brush felt feeling on outside. Super great looks. Very classy jacket. Like the double snaps at the cuff.  Just an all around beautiful light weight jacket.  Even though I just purchased another L/W in Blue from Member's Only, I believe I am going to buy a sky blue London Fog as well.  I wear a Medium, chest size 40 to 42 and this jacket fits just right."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Classic Style Golf Jacket,5,"This jacket is exactly what I wanted.  It is perfect with a light sweater for most of the coldest Phoenix weather, and works as a wind breaker when warmer.  Pockets are adequate, three inside, two with zippers outside.  Be aware that true red is really bright.  I wasn't sure at first, but now that I'm used to the color, I like it.  All in all, a excellent garment."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Perfect lightweight jacket,5,I like this jacket so much I bought a second one. I now have a black and a brown one to go with nearly everything I wear. These jackets are the perfect size and weight for going out on the town in mild weather.They are soft feeling material with a light liner inside. They fit perfectly and the length is just below the belt - just like the advertised picture shows. I do recommend this jacket. I love them.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good jacket,5,"I had bought one of these a few years ago at a closeout store and loved it so much I researched the RN number on the tag to get a duplicate on Amazon. Overall the fit is great, I often wear it when out on long walks and when traveling if the weather is right. I especially like the double front pockets. I always tend to have my compact camera on me for photos, so being able to put my phone in the inner zipped pocket on one side, camera in the inner zipped pocket on the other side, and have my hands in the outer pockets is perfect. One small downside I'll mention with the sizing is there was little difference between the XL-tall size I got on Amazon and my older one that is just regular XL. The tall version seems to be perhaps an inch longer in the torso if that."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very nice jacket,5,"I had exhausted Amazon's catalog of men's Big & Tall jackets, looking for a poplin jacket in camel or beige.  I finally, reluctantly, settled on this one.  I'm glad that I did.  I ordered it in 4X Tall and while the sleeves are a little longer than I would have liked, it is a good looking garment and big enough that I can, if I want, wear a sweater under it.  So, I am pleased."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),The jacket I have been looking for,5,"Never know how clothes purchased online will fit so I was hoping... To my surprise, it's great! Love the quality, the fit (I'm 5-10 & 200ish but trying to lose weight!), the look, the elastic on the side hip area, the lining & how the exterior texture feels. Wish the sleeves were elastic around the wrist but at least they're snaps instead of buttons. Really it's just what I've been looking for in a lightweight jacket.  Very happy I purchased this particular jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Spring Jacket!,5,"I ordered this jacket to replace one I have had for years that had got some kind of grease stain on it while going through security at the airport, and could not be removed despite several attempts to remove it.  This London Fog jacket came in 2 days delivery time thanks to Prime.  I was very impressed with the quality of it, having 4 outside slash pockets, 2 with zippers, and 3 inside pockets, all very roomy.  The zipper is of high quality with a leather pull tab.  The material feels like it would be very rain repellent.  I ordered a large, and it fits well, with some room for any time I might wear a sweater under it.  I am very pleased with the quality, and that I also got it on sale.  I would recommend this jacket for any man looking for a nice quality Spring jacket for semi-casual wear.Oct -2015 Update-  I liked this white jacket so much, that I just bought the exact same thing in black, and it arrived in 2 days, and fits just as nice as the white one.  I wear an XL, and there is plenty of room to move around, stretch, reach, etc. Plenty of pockets.  I still highly recommend this jacket, now that I have two of them!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"I am 5'9', broad-shouldered, and a little wide. XL fits me fine.",5,"The fit is perfect for me, but I don't have long arms, so the sleeves are about 1'2' inch long for me, but that's not bad at all. I don't know whether it sheds rain, but another fellow said it dries quickly. It looks great. The color I bought is Espresso (dark brown). I like the look & fit so much that I think I'll buy 2 more in other colors, if they don't hike the price. It came pretty wrinkled, so I'll try an easy rinse in the washer and a gentle warm setting on the dryer. It should come out fine. There's a thin liner inside. I wasn't expecting it to be warm at all, but it is. The liner is not removable."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),fits right,5,"I like the style, even though I don't golf anymore. I like all the pockets, though I'll have to disable the Velcro on at least one of the inside ones, just to make it easier to get in and out of. I like the elastic waist; and the cuffs, as they are 2-position snaps, so I can unsnap them to free my wrists. I don't know why the color is called, ""iron"". There's not even a hint of red; seems a slate grey. If it wears well, it will have been a great replacement for a 40-year old jacket, at least until I can get its zipper fixed."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Still great after all these years!,5,"With so many classic clothing companies providing reduced quality now, I was pleased London Fog retained their high standard of quality for this jacket.  My husband had this EXACT jacket for over 20 years!  I bought him this replacement and everything was the same except the color (navy) which was a bit newer looking obviously.  Wow!  He doesn’t like change, so he of course was delighted as well. Totally expect this will be the last jacket I need to buy for him. The old one is going to Goodwill for still many years of use."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Windbreaker and Pretty Rain Resistant,5,"I have been pleased with this jacket and have used it often in the last 3 weeks.  Great windbreaker and looks good on. Obviously not meant to keep warm but to resist wind and rain. Got caught in a downpour going from store to car and the jacket repelled the water pretty well.  I expect to use it as an outer layer when shoveling snow to combat the wind.  This thing is loaded with pockets!  The slash pockets that then unzip for additional space is great design.  Only  ""not perfect"" thing for a wind breaker is it would have been nice at the waist to have elastic that clamps to hold it tighter to the waist so that wind couldn't get in but that shouldn't be a deal breaker...Great product"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Thinner than I wanted but very nice Jacket,5,"Ordered and returned the Dickies version of this jacket which was nice but sleeves were way too long with no adjustment at the cuff and jacket was very stiff. This jacket fits perfect and its soft. Looks really good but its a bit thin, more like a windbreaker. The quality is exceptional and we'll be keeping this one."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Its made in China,3,"I am 67 years young South African. I possessed 4 London fog jackets in the 60s, 70s and 80s. They were the best jackets I had worn and they were handed down to my sons and grandsons. They were different from the one I ordered recently. They were standard with external side pockets the insides were lined the cuffs were either with a button or elastic. There were no inside pockets and no mesh. The material and jacket were on the slightly heavier side and rainproof. On the inside right-hand side was a label which read London Fog made and styled by the Londontown Corp. Baltimore, MD; a space to write your name and washing instructions. The zip had a strip of leather attached with London Fog embossed on it. I still have one and tagged it onto my new jacket. It's obvious that my current London fog is not the same jacket. Its styled differently and made in China. I love the mesh and the additional pockets both inside and out. Its light and fits well. The material is completely different. I am 75%  satisfied because it's not what I expected. I was impressed with the speedy delivery to my door by courier."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great jacket,5,This is the perfect spring and fail jacket. Not too light and not too heavy. Lost my first one abd this one is a replacement. Fits as described perfectly
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Well made and looks great!,5,"The jacket looks very nice, and feels comfortable.  I am a male, 5'8, 185 lbs, and the medium size fits perfectly.  The jacket is a heavier weight than I was expecting (or wanted).  It will be a great coat for cooler spring and fall weather in the Pacific Northwest, but is much to thick for summer time. Also, the waistband of the jacket has a strong elastic band around the back, which makes the jacket fit very tightly around the waist. That might be desirable for some people, but I prefer my lighter coats to hang straight at the bottom to allow for more air flow."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Not Colorfast,3,"This is a nicely sewn jacket and it has more pockets than a billiards table...two complaints however: (1) it arrived in a plastic bag and was horribly wrinkled; (2) when I hand washed it in warm water a lot of dye came out in the water (it's the reddish ""chili"" color)...also, the sleeves are quite puffy."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good Quality/Fits True to Size,5,"Overlooked that the jacket is a microfiber shell, but was pleasantly surprised.  The jacket is of the expected London Fog quality, no loose threads, no bad seams, etc.  The color is not as dark as the picture, it's a noticeably dark grey, not almost black.  Another pleasant surprise.  Fit:  Body size is 6'2"", 205 pounds, slender but broad shoulder, shirt size is 17 1/2"" neck, 35/36"" sleeve and the XLT fits perfect."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),The Revenge of the Plastic Bags,2,"This jacket will be returned.  I don't know if it set too long on a shelf in a warehouse somewhere.  The plastic bag did its thing to the finish of  the coat on a hot day in a storage facility somewhere in Nebraska.  The finish is splotched and ugly all over--at least where the plastic shrink wrap came in contact with the fabric.  The quality appears to be OK otherwise.  Mind you, however, I didn't try it on and wear it for a few days.Why doesn't somebody check this sort of thing?"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Jacket just beware of sizing mainly xb sizes.,5,I ended up ordering this jacket 3 times. Initially I wanted a 2xb as they are roomier in the torso than a normal 2xl.  Apparently 2xb's dont exist or the warehouse worker just kept shipping regular 2xls.  On the 3rd I figured I'd just get a regular 3xl as the 2xl was too short.  We'll 3xl was out of stock so I took a gamble and ordered a 3xb..well well just as I expected I recieved a regular 3xl.  It fits fine probably not as well as a 2xb would but much better than 2xl as these jackets are cut a bit short.  Jacket is great just watchout for sizing.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"It fits well, but the fabric is not durable",2,"The jacket looked good for a week (the cutting good, the sewing clean), then a light color stain appeared along the fold of the collar.  I am not sure but it looked like the brushing of the fabric came off due to wear and tear (after only a week).  I liked it when new.  Not after a week.  I know what I am talking about, because I was in the garment business for decades.I have never seen a jacket behave like this."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Quality garment,5,"The London Fog jacket fits perfectly and the color is very attractive.  The quality of the jacket is excellent:  fabric, fit, stitching, attention to detail, available colors.  Even the metal zipper is sized perfectly.  Too many zipper jackets have very thin plastic or metal zippers that seem to fail all too quickly.  London Fog has always made quality clothing and this jacket is no exception.  The price is more than reasonable  for this jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),sales stickers left ugly discolored stripe on fabric,1,I only just noticed that one of the stickers on the garment left an ugly discolored stripe on the left sleeve. It's a great jacket but this looks really janky. Someone cheaped out in the last mile and used a sticker with a bad glue instead of tying a label to the zipper.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Light and great quality,5,"This golf jacket is perfect for cool days and light rain. As someone else mentioned it was very wrinkled due to the tight packaging but 10 minutes in a dryer with a wet towel and then immediate hanging, took away all the wrinkles and made the jacket look pristine. It is comfortable with lots of room in the shoulders and arms and the bottom fits around the waist thus giving complete freedom for a golf swing. Both arms have two snaps at the wrist, which allows either snug or loose fit. A great coat for the money!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"A reasonably priced ""full cut"" golf jacket.",5,"I like this jacket. I ordered the black and the material is soft and has a brushed look. I read several reviews before purchasing it because my size runs between large and extra large. I am 6'1"" tall weigh 205 lbs and I purchased the large. It fits great with plenty of room for a sweater under it. The jacket is well made with a light lining, perfect for my gulf coast location. The cuffs have adjustable snaps and a spare snap was included. It has plenty of pockets but still looks sharp. all in all a nice golf jacket at a reasonable price."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Cheap material, small fit",1,"First, this package arrived crumpled up into a small ball slightly larger than my hand.  By the time I opened it and shook it out, it was all deep wrinkles.  The wrinkles may come out once it is hung up, but between the overall size (too small and not as described), plus the shiny, cheap sateen of the material that slides around, I'm returning this jacket.  If I had seen this coat on a rack in a department store, I never would have looked at it twice."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Nice S Florida jacket, longs are long, runs big",5,"Great South Florida winter jacket (for below 70f down to about 45f or so, with room to layer if necessary. I'm a 3x tall but returned for 2x tall. Rain beads off and it doesn't get too clammy in S FL humidity. Each of three interior pockets are sufficient for more than a phone (velcro, one with flap) and the outer pocket zippers somehow aren't uncomfortable against your wrists. Comfortable neck."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),A good buy.,5,"A nice early fall jacket.  Fits nicely for a 5'8"" man with a bit of a belly.  Goes slightly below the belt line.  The sleeves are about 1 inch longer than I want,  but not annoying."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Comfortable Casual Jacket  - Great Product,5,"I had this style London Fog jacket for over 15 years!!!  the previous jacket was comfortable and wore well.  After 15 years the only thing I had to replace was the zipper after 14 years and the jacket became a little faded but still looked good.  I thought it was time to get a new jacket and knew I wanted the same style and same company.  The new updated version has some additional pockets , a softer outer material and mesh lining that made it feel ""broken in"" from the first time I put it on.  This is a great product and I hope I get the same wear as the previous one."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Excellent jacket, better than I thought it would be. Order actual size.",5,This is a terrific light jacket. London Fog is a great company. Not only does this have zippered pockets in front but also a non zippered jacket over these. this is perfect for zipping gloves in pockets and still  place to rest hands if you have gloves in the others. Several inner pockets. I wear a large and this was a perfect fit as large. This is a nice fit but easily would go over a thick sweater and fit comfortably.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Nice Jacket,4,"Nice jacket that I bought for my dad. He likes the inside pockets on each side as well as the two zipper pockets on the outside. The fit was good for him. A 4XT lays a couple inches below the waist line. He also has enough room for a thicker shirt or sweatshirt if needed. Not sure why the under collar has a blue and white plaid material, but not a deal breaker. Would buy again."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good Value Spring Jacket,4,"Excellent price. A bit lighter in color than expected but that was ok. Interesting texture: the outside jacket has a suede-like appearance but it's still a good look. The jacket is light-weight and has handy pockets: 2 zippered ones on the outside of the jacket and 2 inside Velcro-secured pockets. The fit is inconsistent: a little too flowing thru the shoulders and chest but less flexible In the waist than I anticipated. That lack of flexibility may come from the combination of unstretched and corrugated stretch fabric at the bottom of the jacket. I would have preferred a totally unstretched bottom to the jacket. From reviewing the listing photo, I thought that all of the jacket bottom would be unstretched. The sleeves are long which is fine for me at 35"" but might be too long for some men. Nonetheless,  an excellent value at $50. Not sure that I would get this particular jacket again, but the price is right and I have always found London Fog products to be high-quality and durable."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Nice jacket that wrinkles.,4,"Good: Jacket is very comfortable, with lots of pockets, and comes in very cool colors.Bad: I've ordered four of these, and they all arrived extremely wrinkled. I solved the problem by soaking them in water, and putting them in the dryer for thirty minutes. This got rid of about 80% of wrinkles. Jacket still wrinkles in the back from sitting in a chair!Verdict: 5 stars for jacket style and colors..... 3 stars for non-wrinkle resistant material."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Just Perfect,5,"Wife had been telling me for years to buy the same one I bought 12 years ago, which is really my favorite for daily wear regardless of the season.  Finally found them at Amazon, same brand, size, but with great selection.  They are comfortable, stylish and great for golfing."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),About what I expected.,4,"Pretty good jacket for the price. Don't go expecting a luxurious feeling jacket. Bear in mind that it's pretty affordable. That being said it's a solid jacket, nothing special just a solid jacket. I would recommend it to someone shopping in the price range I paid for sure."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Year round jacket,5,"This is a great jacket. Lightweight enough to be worn year round. I sometimes wear mine in the Summer, especially when going to some offices that are kept cold, such as doctors offices, hospitals, movie theaters, etc. This jacket is almost indestructible. I have another one of these that I have been wearing for 11 years. It still looks the same as when I bought it, but I recently broke the zipper when it got caught in a crevice and I jerked it out. My fault, not a problem with the jacket. I do wish that the black color was a litter blacker though. It has a faded, worn look when you get it, but the color never fades from that."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great quality. Band makes waist too small for size,4,"Very well made, as I expect from London Fog. Mesh lining minimizes sweat. Color is exactly as pictured. The band is too tight, makes waist much too small so I'm getting the elastic altered. Otherwise fits slightly smaller than size; no room to layer."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Fit seems a little wonky,4,"Jacket is a bit larger than expected. Arms a tad longer. Not a huge problem. With a shirt and sweater underneath I expect it to fit comfortably. Just to throw on it though, it seems like I should have gotten a medium. Fabric seem a bit thin and shows wrinkles. Not sure how rain proof it is."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Nice Jacket,5,My husband wanted to replace an old golf jacket of his. This London Fog jacket fits him very well. He ordered it in Navy and it is just what he wanted.The only negative comment is that it was shipped in a bag and ended in our mailbox. It would have been much better if shipped in a box. It was wrinkled when we received it.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),It's ok,4,"Arms are a bit long and cuffs would be better if they were not buttons and, I had to cut the elastic on the bottom (in the back) so it doesn't pull around to the side of the waist. It fits at the waist just right after I cut that, it's ok now."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great features,5,"Took it overseas and it was great. It has four outside pockets, two of them close with zippers. Two inside pockets close with Velcro. A third tiny inside pocket also closes with Velcro. Relatively pick-pocket proof, although the inner pockets can get unwittingly closed and then quickly slipping in the phone or wallet is a tiny hassle. It was just a bit cold at 45F with just a dress shirt, but great in the 50s and 60s with just a dress shirt or polo. And mostly rain-proof. And it fits nicely, not too baggy but not tight."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),A Great Summer Evening Jacket,5,"It's a very good lightweight summer evening jacket. It has no lining. It has plenty of pockets; 2 on the outside and  3 on the inside ( 2 breast pockets, & 1 smaller pocket on the lower left side). Only the shoulders width is slightly big, but I like it a little loose anyway. I give it two thumbs up."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very happy with my new jacket.,5,"Just a real nice light jacket. I'm 6ft. and 140lbs., ordered a medium, and fits about perfect. For me, an inside pocket is a must. This jacket has 3!  Plus the double slash pockets. 2 are zippered, and 2 regular. I've always heard about London Fog, and now I have one.For a light jacket, for the price, what's not to like?"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Can't go wrong with a London Fog!,5,"I've had a cement colored jacket from another brand for years and years, but it became too stained and tattered to wear for any outing other than chores. It also was a regular XL. The arms were always too short as I am 6'3"" 250lbs. So I saw the London Fog in cement and XLtall. Bought it. Love it. Fits perfectly and the arms are finally the correct length. Sits on my hips perfectly.  Gonna buy another for sure."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),6 years and counting,5,It's been 6 years since purchasing this jacket and it's still like brand new even though my husband wears it almost daily ... well worth the investment.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Jacket,5,I have bought this jacket from  an outlet and I liked it because it has to  4 pockets in front and two inside in addition of small one for holding phone or medication. But I can't find this in any shop anymore. The jacket holds very well and is made by not cutting corners. It arrived on time and was packed very well. I will most likely buy more as my older ones start of wear out.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Great Fit, Weird Color.",4,"So I just received this jacket in the mail about ten minutes ago and was both pleasantly surprised and less than impressed with different features of the item.First off, I want to say that I was looking for a jacket like the one James Dean wore in 'Rebel Without a Cause.' This popped up in my results and it seemed to fit the bill, right down to the shirt-style collar. I ordered it in ""chili"" because it looked to be the appropriate shade of red.Now I typically wear an XL jacket, regardless of the brand. After reading some reviews, however, I decided to go down a size and I'm glad I did. I run warm and don't often layer clothes - a shirt under a jacket is usually all I need. I ordered it in a Large and I'm very pleased with the cut and fit of it. I prefer my clothes to fit more snugly than most because oversized jackets tend to make me look heavier than I am. It fits well without being tight and, in my opinion, is very well made. The double-entry pockets are a nice, modern touch, but the jacket has a vintage style to it that I really like.My problem with this jacket is only in regards to the color. On my screen ""chili"" appears to be a crimson/burgundy red color. The jacket, however (which has ""chili"" on the tag so I know I received the correct color) isn't terribly red at all, it's more of a deep orange color. It reminds me of some of the scenes from Breaking Bad - that reddish-orange sand out in the middle of the New Mexico desert. I'm a little disappointed by the disparity in color, but am so pleased with the cut and fit of the jacket itself that I will most likely just keep it until ""red"" becomes an option."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good Jacket.  Nicely Fit,5,"Read other reviews.  Was skeptical about the wrinkles and suede-like material as other reviews mentioned.Just slight wrinkle on one arm when received.  Washed in cold water, dried in the dryer for 15 minutes then hung dry.  Looks better after being washed.  The color black is not really black.  Over all, pleased with the purchase."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Perfect for spring/fall,5,"Comfortable light jacket with enough lining for slightly chilly evenings but not heavy like a winter coat. Good looking design. It fits tight with an elastic band around the waist, not like a standard loose fitting coat, but it's not too tight. Good color options."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Nice, but issue",4,"Good looking light weight jacket.  My only complaint is that when opened the jacket had many wrinkles.  Did not go away over a few days, so I washed it.  Only a small improvement.  Without the wrinkles this jacket would have been rated 5 stars."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),I want to describe detailed sizes on this product page ...,4,I want to describe detailed sizes on this product page.I purchased Color: Black Size:Large Tall from Japan.I measured the size.shoulder to Center of collar : 28.5 cm  11.2 inchArm : 65.5 cm 25.8 inchChest : 66 cm 26 inchlength : 72.5 cm 28.5 inchstomach? : 64 cm 25.2 inchWaist : 51 cm(Rubber stretch 64 cm) 20.1 inch (25.2 inch)
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),This is the jacket that I was looking for!,5,This is a jacket that I’ll use most of the year. Very versatile with most varied temperatures. Comfortable from short sleeve to sweat shirt. Very useful pockets. The positive reviews are accurate. I originally ordered a large but immediately returned for Xlarge and it fits perfectly. Very satisfied!Update:I ordered a second one (different color) and noticed an improvement on the cuff snaps. Very nice! I love this jacket!
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Just what I needed,4,"I wanted a rain-proof, wind-proof jacket.  This jacket serves the purpose.  It fits perfectly, arm length, etc.  I got a medium blue shade, that's neutral enough to blend with anything.  However, it does wrinkle easily (the reason I gave it 4 stars)!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Color Blind,3,"The fit is ok, but the color is kind of a joke. It was supposed to be dark brown and ended up looking like a puke-grey."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),What More Can One Say? It’s a London Fog,5,"Well made jacket, looks great, fits well. I really haven’t had a chance to wear it much; abbreviated Spring and all. Went from my wearing my winter London Fog trench to not needing a jacket at all. Can’t wait until Autumn though."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Fabric was permanently creased,2,"I looked for a Navy golf jacket at several brick and mortar stores. I did find this same jacket but only in five colors (what London Fog offers as Navy is to me essentially black). But, I was able to try one on for fit before I ordered the Sapphire Blue on Amazon. The color was actually close to what I call Navy (the included picture showing the collar is close for color in good light). I liked everything about the jacket except that the fabric was creased (see pics). I thought these might wash out but they did not. I also could not iron them out. Because of this I had to return the jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Perfect Light [Travel] Jacket that has it all!,5,"Bought this XL size jacket primarily as a [light] travel jacket to temperate/cold climates (since I live in AZ).  I took this to Switzerland and Germany the first week in March.  It was perfect down to about 45 degrees, without a lot of wind.  It does have some wind-breaking ability and sheds rain/snow well.Pros:1.  Four external pockets!  Two on each side with one zippered and one not.2.  Three internal pockets.  One on each side with velcro closure, great for securely holding a wallet/camera/passport. The third internal pocket holds my Samsung Galaxy 5 phone perfectly, with a velcro closure.3.  Feel and look of coat is very nice, a micro-suede.  It looks classy enough to dress up or down. This jacket screams quality from the zippers, to the material to the stitching.  If you've ever owned any other London Fog product, you know what I am talking about.4.  Will keep you warmer than you think a light golf jacket could be.5.  Two snaps on the wrist, for a close fit or looser fit.6.  All this for $39?!  Seriously a great value.  I'm thinking of ordering another to keep in reserve after this one wears out.Cons:Only one minor observation that wouldn't prevent me from ordering this again or recommending it.  Regarding the fit, I checked ""Fit as Expected"", which it mostly does.  However, it seems the sleeves tend to ride up and seem shorter than they really are, especially when driving.  When standing, they are fine.  I am over 6 ft. and have a long torso.  Normally, I have trouble finding coats long enough but it fits just right---I wouldn't want it any shorter.  The gathering around the waist, took some getting used to at first, but now I don't even notice it."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Nice overall jacket...,5,"To be honest, I wanted a light-weight windbreaker and thought this would fit this role.  It's VERY nice, but warmer and thicker than I expected.  But it's durability and comfortable fit makes this my current go to jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Fits my large shouldered husband perfectly,5,"My husband picked out this jacket for himself. He has extremely broad shoulders, he usually buys an extra large in shirts and jackets but some of them don’t have a generous enough shoulder width. This jacket fits him perfect. The shoulders are not too tight and he’s usually able to move in it. In fact he plans to buy the same jacket and another color as well."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"PLEASE, CAN YOU MAKE IT JUST LITTLE LONGER",1,"Disappointed, fit GREAT everywhere but the length....up to my belly button looked like a Mariachi band jacket.....weird."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),It is not tight because the material is very comfortable and moves with my body,5,"London Fog Men's Zip Front Light Mesh Lined Golf...The size is OK. I wear an XL jacket and it fits. This one is slightly snug. The jacket fits me as my A2 jacket does. It lays against my body as a jacket should so it doesn't add weight and sloppiness to my appearance.  It is not tight because the material is very comfortable and moves with my body....but some people, as myself  like for their jackets to be a little loose and not snug. If I  were to  gain 15# or 2 inches in my stomach I am afraid it would be too tight.That being said the jacket seems to be very well made and looks very nice so I gave it 5 stars because it is what​ it was advertised to be. . I think the price is fair."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Quality, traditional jacket",5,"This is a comfortable, well-made jacket. The material feels soft, the zipper is sturdy. London Fog has been around a long time, a solid brand. This is a traditional-style jacket that has been, and always will be, in style."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),London Fog Still Has It,5,"After trying several of the slightly lower priced ""other"" brands I decided to try a brand I had known for many years. The other jackets I had to return because they were too small even though I had ordered all in the same size. The London Fog fit. Also, the material , water resistant as the others I ordered, had a better quality feel to it."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),The London Fog Golf Jacket is an excellent one and enjoyable to wear!,5,I have to say that the London Fog Golf Jacket at the Extra Large size really helps me in wearing it so nice and comfortable all together. I highly recommend it for men who are large-sized and it is an excellent one as well.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Nice jacket, color not as expected",4,"This is a nice jacket.  Simple, but nice.  It's light, with smooth fabric, and multiple interior pockets.  The size seemed accurate, and the sleeve buttons mean its sleeves can probably accommodate just about anyone.  My only disappointment was the color.  It's a nice shade of orange, w/ an appropriate name: chili.  It's just more orange and less red than I expected it to be from looking at pictures on various websites and multiple computer screens.  Ever make chili yourself or try more expensive canned chili that looks more red than orange?  It's not that color.  It's more like Hormel or Wolf brand canned chili.  Neither sounds like a particularly good jacket color...don't worry, it does actually look nice (it's a nice jacket).  Just expect it to be a bit more on the orange side than on the red side."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very lightweight but a sturdy wind breaker,4,"It's a quality light jacket and is good against the wind. I've been wearing it with a puffy winter vest and it's been effective until it hits single digits and then I break out the heavier coat. On its own it's good through most of the midwest spring, fall, and early winter weather. Nice useful pockets and a quality zipper yet it seems sturdy enough to last for a number of years of fairly constant use. The only problem I've had with it is that when it warms up during the day and I sweat a little it will stain the collar area. I used some Shout on it and it came out easily in the wash. I wash it in warm and dry on high and it didn't shrink. It's lighter than I expected, but it's well made and seems sturdy enough to last. The large fits me well with and without the vest and I usually wear large to extra large shirts (about a 44). I recommend it."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Five Stars,5,"I like this jacket.  Each side has two pockets, one zippered and one not - so four pockets on the outside (good for putting your hands in, and carrying items that need more security.  Inside, each side also has two inner breast pockets that secure with a small square of velcro in the center opening, so it doesn't totally close (like coins could fall out if turned upside down) but wallets and the like would be too large to slip past the center velcro square seal.  Then in the inner lower left, there is a 4"" wide, 5"" deep little pocket with a flap that secures with velcro - smaller, but more secure than the other inner pockets.  I don't use it, myself, but maybe keys or something small and valuable could be put inside there with reasonable security."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Barely acceptable,3,"The jacket is too short. It should go a little further below the belt line.The biggest problem is the zipper.The zipper pull should ALWAYS be on the left side, it's been reversed.The zipper seems very weak."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Jacket!,5,"Nice looking and comfortable jacket for a good price.  I bought a XXL and it fit perfectly.  I am 240 pds, broad shoulders, 40 inch waist."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Quality exceeds price, how novel.",5,I'm a picky shopper. I know what I want but finding what I want is much too difficult anymore. I expect quality at a reasonable price. I have bought a lot of jackets trying to find just the right one only to donate them to charity. Success finally. Fits as expected and quality exceeds price. Not often the case anymore. I guess there are still a few companies the take pride in the product they sell and value their customers. A winner jacket and a winner company.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),The jacket I've been looking for.,5,"There are very few options trying to find a decent jacket in a retail store these days. This one is perfect for me. lots of pockets, excellent fit, and the fabric is nice. Much better quality than those mad in China. I will buy another just have  a spare."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Quality Product at Great Price!,5,"Good quality material and construction.  Fit perfectly.  I am 5’ 10” 150 1bs. and Medium was recommended and Medium it was.  In contrast to several reviews, jacket is slightly more substantial than they indicated.  Perfect weight for spring or fall weather."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good Spring jacket,5,"Got these for my father as a Spring jacket.He likes them and its not thick.My father is 5'11"" and about 180 lbs.Medium fits him well and not snug."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),I likely wouldn't have found a better fit in the store,5,"I have 38' sleeves, and have a very hard time finding jackets that fit. While the sleeves could have been a tad longer for ideal it still is quite acceptable. I likely wouldn't have found a better fit in the store. I do wish they put the sleeve lengths in the size chart. Jacket came in handy as I got it yesterday and the weather was too warm for my winter coat and we had strong storms come through and it did it's job, kept me dry."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),FITS WELL AND FITS EVERYWHERE !!,5,"Fits chest, waist and arms, including length !!  Can be hard to find something that is a comfortable fit ALL the way around AND zip comfotably, but LONDON FOG does it well !! Comfortable on the waist band, not tight thru the shoulders nor does it hang loosely with too long sleeves!!  Can wear unzipped or zipped with equal comfort !!  Good color selection !!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),I am very satisfied with both the fit and the feel,5,"I just received my London Fog Auburn jacket today. After trying it on, I am very satisfied with both the fit and the feel. I am around 5'9"" and about 170lb, and the medium size fits me perfectly. The coat has a lightweight mesh lining which makes it just a little warmer than a windbreaker. It is exactly the jacket I wanted for those in-between fall and spring days in which the temperature is from about 45 degrees to about 60 degrees Fahrenheit. The color I bought is called ""chili"". It is a very appealing shade of rusty red. My initial impression is that the quality seems very high. But obviously I will need much more time to determine how well it holds up with wear."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Nice Jacket.,5,Nice jacket. Down south don’t need a heavy coat. Great for weather we experience here.  Has pockets in the jacket both sides inside left and inside right. VERY IMPORTANT. I am very happy with this jacket.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great quality and features,4,"Everything is terrific about the jacket except the material it is made of.  I was replacing one from a number of years ago and tried to get the same thing.  Mostly it is as good and better than the previous jacket except I wanted polished cotton and this seems to be microfiber.  A little heavy for a restaurant or a chilly summer evening jacket. I love the pockets, the zipper, the style, the fit, etc. - great quality."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Fit and stylle,5,I like the style/color for a spring and fall jacket.The first one I bought was to big so I bought the next size downThis size fit much better although it is roomy. It’s nice though because I wear a sweatshirt underwear
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Gorgeous spring/summer jacket,5,I bought this jacket for my husband because white jackets/sweaters for men are hard to find. This London Fog is a beauty and he loves it. It fits perfectly and is great for chilly spring days to play golf or whatever.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very Nice Jacket,5,"This jacket just arrived today and it fits my husband very well.  It's a 3XL and true to size - zipper closes comfortably without leaving excess room. The jacket is nicely designed, with convenient pockets inside and out, as well as a mesh interior and silky sleeve lining that allow it to slip on and off easily.  The olive color is a nice soft shade - suitable for Spring or Fall."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great jacket for price!,5,"Wow was I surprised at this jacket. I purchased this to go along with my boyfriend’s Halloween costume (he was going as Fry from Futurama). The color, fit and style was perfect. I was really (pleasantly) surprised at the quality of this item. It seems really good, there’s a ton of pockets, and I can definitely see my boyfriend wearing this for more than just Halloween. Wow!!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good Quality London Fog Jacket,5,"I am really pleased with this jacket.  It fits as expected and has a nice inside shell, zippered side pockets and also left and right inside pockets. Good outer appearance too.  Would recommend this."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Fit, finish, comfort are excellent",5,"This jacket is my second London fog. I’m 5’11 and weigh 160, and the medium is perfect. 5 pockets, just the right amount of insulation make this a perfect 3 season light coat- occasionally layer with a sweatshirt. It fits low enough and has elastic along lower that makes it look like a bomber jacket. My arms are long 34-35 inches, and the sleeves are ample. Great price, great purchase"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good value,4,I bought the large and found that this would fit better on a shorter and heavier person.  Sleeves and body were too short and was too loose. Not a good fit. I am 5'-11 and 170 lb and normally fit L.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very Nice Jacket,5,"Good quality, very nice jacket. Nice soft feel to outer shell. Fits true. I'm 5'10, 165lbs. 41"" chest, 32"" waist. I wear a 15.5/33 regular dress shirt or 16/33 slim cut. I originally ordered Large but too big in the shoulder and waist (way too baggy in the body) and a little too long in the sleeve. Returned and re-ordered medium - perfect. It is a lightweight jacket. Body lining is a light mesh with two inside pockets. I'd suggest good to wear for 60F and above wearing a T-shirt or short sleeve polo. I would be hesitant wearing it in temperatures below 60F, maybe with a long sleeve sweater, could get away with 50F. Back gussett extends from shoulder to armpit. Stays relatively close to body versus opening like a flapper upon body movement. I'm thinking of maybe taking the jacket to my tailor and sew down the gussett so it stays flat."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),A Quality Jacket!,5,"Great Black Matte Jacket! I got this product from London Fog, and it's really nice! I believe it is, 95% Polyester and 5% Nylon, it is Water-Resistant and Wind-Blocking or Resistant. I got mine in a Blackish Color, and I spent 36.99 on it, nearly 10 dollars off from 60 dollar's, the original price! Great quality, lots of pockets to hold all your item's, 5 to be exact! The only thing that is slightly annoying, is the green plaid under the collar, and sort of the bigger part on the upper arm. Other than 2 small things, a great quality Black Jacket, the package was nice and it also comes with a extra button! 5 out of 5 from me!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very wrinkled and cheap looking.,2,"Item was ""ok""  for money but no bargain.  It came in a 9 x 12 envelope and was so badly wrinkled that we could not iron them out.  Took to laundry for professional laundering and pressing.  Looks better but still wrinkly and cheap looking....unless you like this really casual look.  I guess it's ok for the money.....fits ok and fairly well made.....just makes a bad impression for London Fog.  Wouldn't buy again, even for the cheap price."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great feel high quality jacket,5,This is a great jacket.  Nice feel of the fabric and lining.  Good fit all around provides flexibility for golfing.  Many pockets with zippers.  Highly recommend this.  High quality materials should last a long time.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),London Fog Light Weight Jacket.,5,"Fits great, the zipper works flawlessly.  The only thing I didn't like is that there is a button inside the lining.  I don't know if it's intentional. You'd have to open a seam to get it out."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Looks great.,5,"Looks and fits great. Quality, brand name, merchandise( not made in China). Like it so much I'll keep it, even though it's not as lightweight as I was expecting. Perfect for spring and fall."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Big and tall beware.,1,"This thing does not make to your belt line. I have never purchased a jacket so short from anywhere in the U.S. It is a BIG AND TALL size, but the length ends between your belly button and waist. Hard pass."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Nice golf jacket,5,Nice lightweight golf jacket with several large pockets that zip and with velcro closure The polyester fabric seems to be durable and nicely stitched. The zipper works well. The price reasonable.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent garment for the money.,5,"My wife had to make one modification, that is releasing the elastic at the waistline. Too tight for otherwise perfect fit and construction. Being poly it washes and dries very well with no shrinkage."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Jacket,5,"This jacket is wonderfully conceived and made.  It has a modern sporty look with attention to comfort and convenience as well.  The color of ""olive"" is like a khaki green but not as drab.  Actually it is a neutral shade that can go with many other colors.  Very pleased with this purchase!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),"Excellent ""back to basics"" jacket",5,"It's been too warm to wear, but in ""try-on's"" the fit is very good, perhaps just a bit roomy, but fine... tested under the water faucet and it was like water off a duck's back. Hope that stays. Otherwise, it is just an updated version of the London Fog golf jacket I wore fifty years ago - except that one had a small pocket for a score-keeping pencil - and this one seems more water repellent."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Perfect for casual outings that require more than a denim jacket,4,"I ordered a Navy Blue, Medium for my husband as he wears a medium shirt. It was way to big and I exchanged for a small. The small is perfect (he's 5'6"", 150lb).I took off a star for the color.  The first jacket was a deep, dark, blue.  This jacket looks black, though sometimes I think I see a hint of blue in it.  My husband decided to keep it anyway. He likes it. It looks good. Perfect for casual restaurant dining, dropping by a friend's house, going to the movies, etc."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Early Spring/Fall Jacket,5,"I'm about 5' 7"", ""big"" according to Gabriel Iglesias' standard and bought a medium.  I'm the same body type as that guy in the other review standing in front of the celebrity photo station.  Perfect fit.  Very nice jacket.  Light, and the exterior is smooth and pleasant. I wouldn't wear anything other than a thin sweater underneath, though, if I wanted to layer I'd have gotten a large. Very thin jacket, so not my choice for a rainy day or cold day.  This is my early spring/fall jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very nice jacket,5,"I was pleasantly surprised as was my husband by the quality of this jacket.  I was a bit skeptical when I saw a London Fog for $50.00 but I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did.  This is an excellent between seasons jacket.  There is just enough room to add a sweater or two but it still looks good without them (sometimes when a jacket has that much room it will look too big when you aren't wearing the sweaters under it but this one still looks good).  Inside t has a breast pocket on each side and one extra smaller pocket on one side, and of course outside it has the two regular pockets for your hands.  I bought the light blue which is a nice neutral color, along the line of a steel blue.  Masculine but not militaristic like some blues can look.  Overall I am very pleased."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),PERFECT light weight Jacket!!,5,"Just got this. LOVE IT! Wasn't sure if I needed Large or X-Large, but I like mine rather snug and just below belt. If you're close to my height or weight, XL might be better for you. Again, I like mine just long enough up front and snug when zipped up.Perfect light weight jacket. Looks good! Can work both for casual or for business casual. LOVE the 7 different pockets!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),I wish it was longer,3,"I bought the Large-Tall version of this jacket, thinking that it would fit my 6 foot 1 inch frame. The Large-Tall versions of clothing are usually just right for me. But this particular jacket is simply a couple of inches too short for me. I decided to keep it and I do wear it occasionally, but I am definitely disappointed by its inadequate length."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Runs large.,5,"Fit perfect, ordered a medium knowing it runs large.  London fog from this vendor runs larger. Ordered brown from the other vendor on Amazon and that one was too small. Also ordered a members only jacket in XL and fit the same as London fog medium."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Perfect,5,I own a blue one and this is my second one of these  . I like the first one so much i bought a second in a different color. Great spring light weight jacket . I would highly recommend !
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great light jacket,5,Bought this jacket to replace a similar one I left in the overhead bin on an airplane.  I like this one even better than the old one. I now miss the pen that was in the old jacket more than the old jacket itself.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),This is a GREAT jacket. I was a little concerned about the ...,5,"This is a GREAT jacket. I was a little concerned about the sizing though, I am not very big but I like to wear things a little big. So I bought a L and after reading the reviews I thought for sure I'd be returning it, but it fit just as I wanted it to. It is a very soft outer shell. I have seen jackets of this quality going for $130, so to find this jacket for $30 is a bargain. I bought three more of different colors."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),I was hoping for a better fit,3,"The elastic at the waist is too small...the buttons at the wrist never stay fastened...it faded after one wash and I think it even shrank a little. I do like that it has two exterior pockets on each side (one with a zipper, on each side) as well as two interior pockets (one on each side) and a small interior pocket about the size of a credit card or business card."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Usually take a medium,5,"I am 5 feet 8 inches and usually buy a medium. I read reviews saying this jacket runs large so I ordered a small. I like how it fits, but if someone is larger I would suggest it might be tight. For example if I snap the sleeves it feels a little tight; with the sleeves unsnapped I think it fits me very well. Like the Iron color, the lining is nice. It is a good jacket for chilly days. Overall I am very pleased."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Wrong size and color.  Very lightweight seemed well built.,3,I ordered a 2X tall.  The 2X was correct but the Tall was not.  Way too short.  Not even as tall as a regular 2x.Ordered Maroon and got a weird worn looking plum color instead.  Not appealing at all.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Light comfortable jacket,5,This is a fine jacket which is light enough for moderate weather while having enough room to wear over a sweater. It was just what I had hoped to get. The quality is what I'd expect of London Fog. Would recommend it.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Arrived wrinkled and faded black,3,The jacket arrived very wrinkled. I left it on a hanger for a day but it still looks like it had been crumpled up in a ball. Also the shade of black is more faded than what I would have expected.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Perfect Lightweight Men's Jacket,5,I purchased this jacket for my husband after searching several department stores in our area.  He wanted a lightweight jacket for our relatively mild Southern California winter.  All of the jackets that I found seemed perfect if you lived in Minnesota or North Dakota.  When I looked on Amazon and found this it appeared to be just what I'd been trying to buy.  When it arrived we found that to be true.  My husband loves it and has worn it almost every day since the package arrived.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Questionable quality,3,"I rarely ever return an item.  I have had to return this item twice.  First time was due to size.  I had read in the comments on this product that the jacket ran big and that you should order a size down.  I did so and the jacket was too small.  So I returned for my normal size and it fit perfectly.  However, the first time I wore the jacket my keys got stuck in the pocket.  I noticed a large hole in the pocket from a seam that had not been properly sewn.  So I'm returning it a second time.  I like the jacket but the hole in the pocket makes me question the quality.  I ordered a replacement but now think that I should have just returned it and found another jacket altogether.  We'll see what happens."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Appears to be made very well,5,"This was an excellent price for the quality it appears to have. Material is soft but thick/durable. London Fog has long had a good reputation, so I hope the quality is as it has always been. My son was very pleased with it Christmas morning. Added bonus, there were many colors to choose from, unlike the store, where they are very limited."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Jacket!,5,"I am 5’7”,140 lbs, size small Fit perfectly.  Beautiful color and great pockets; 4 on outside- 2 with zipper; 2 inside pockets as well."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Women Get this for pockets!,5,"I bought this because I am tired of women's clothes not having pockets and I needed a new jacket for work let me tell you so many pockets, really warm in a light weight kind of way perfect if the ac is too low. The waist was a bit tight and the sleeves too long but that didn't bother me much."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),My husband loved this jacket!,5,"I bought this light-weight jacket as an early Father's Day gift for my hubby and it was long overdue!  His old ""golf"" jacket was very worn and too small now.  I ordered the 2XL-Tall and it's a wonderful and roomy fit for him.  On a chilly golfing morning or for anytime in the fall or early spring, this will be used a lot.  We live in north central Missouri and I doubt that he'll ever need it in the summer here, but it's a great weight and zips nicely, has lots of pockets and will obviously shed some water if he gets caught in the rain.  A big success as a gift and a quality item."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great jacket.,4,"Nice jacket, well made, comfortable feel and fit.  Cuffs are a bit big, but the snap closures are fine and make the cuffs work.  My only “issue” is that I had hoped the jacket was a bit longer, it comes right to the waist/belt line.  Overall a nice, warm, comfortable jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Nice jacket,5,Nice jacket and it came on time.  Good price.  Standard size but it didn't fit my husband .  We have a hard time finding a jacket for him.  He's a small guy and he really would fit in a boys  Xlarge but they are juvenile in style and color.  I was disappointed because it would have been a great jacket.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Poor quality knockoff!,1,"The material and quality was not at all what I expected in London Fog  jacket.  It also wasn't ""long/tall"" as advertised.  The London Fog label probably cost more than the jacket itself!"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Adequate Pockets at last,5,"This was an early birthday gift for my husband. It accomplished its purpose, which was to encourage him to replace a very  worn (to the point of shabbiness), very old spring/fall weight jacket. He was loath to do so because other jackets did not have enough pockets for his needs. The old jacket is now in the Goodwill bag. Thank you, London Fog."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very Pleased,5,"London Fog makes quality products and this jacket is no exception. Jacket fits great and in yellow works well with jeans, khakis, and business casual pants. I would Buy again."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great color and fit!,5,"Ordered this for my 18 year old son because he mentioned that he liked the look of these sort of jackets. The color is exactly as pictured and fits great. He is very satisfied. For reference, my son is 5'7"" and 200 lbs, ordered a L."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Comfortable lightweight jacket,5,"Really like the comfortable fit and smooth material.  Like that inner lining is smooth and fits easily over fleece sweaters and flannel shirts without ""sticking"".  Also like the convenient pockets and general overall appearance and ""look"" of this jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),It FITS,5,This jacket fits really good. I had a sweater and a undershirt on and it still fit well.  Length of the arms and the shoulders were fine and comfortable.  I got the white and am very pleased with it.
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good quality,5,"I got this for my dad and it is fantastic quality. the color and fabric are even and durable. Finally got to through away his Members Only jacket! The only problem is that the sleeves are to long for him, but easily remedied by rolling them. Highly recommend"
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Light weight jacket!,5,"Liked the fit & quality for a light weight jacket just like I needed. Liked so much I ordered another in another color. Perfect for brisk, but not too cold, days to stop the wind & allow for movement."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),It is the coolest,5,"I wish I never had to send it to the cleaners - I may get another so when this is cleaning I have another to wear. It is perfect light weight (I also use it inside for overly cooled offices), the rain rolls off (rolls off!), and so much more. It is London Fog. If I need to be warmer and need it, I just wear a sweater of the right thickness, and the jacket is then perfect for creating the pocket of warm air. I also believe it breathes, because I never feel myself perspiring. But then, I could talk about it all day and bore a reader a bunch - it is just a great product. I do have to add that I almost use all the pockets - they are also great."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),I was surprised at the quality for the price.,5,I was surprised at the quality for the price. Exceeded my expectations. Just received it so can’t speak to durability but looks like it will wear well. Has a metal zipper which will last longer.
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Fellow fats, do not buy 2XL... Go 1XLT / Tall (minus a size, Tall.)",5,"So... For stocky or big people thinking about going to 2XL... Don't! I am 5'7 230 and 2XL was M A S S I V E, baggy at the bottom, baggy at the cuffs, but bunched up in the shoulders. All other 2XL Carhartt clothing fits me great, but this jacket in 2X does not. I exchanged my 2XL for a 1XL Tall, and it is the perfect length, my shoulder area is not bunched up, cuffs and bottom of jacket are just right, no drafts like with the 2x.Agree with all the other reviews as far as build quality/feel/insulative qualities of the jacket. Very happy with it."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Size Review,5,"I went a size down like a lot of people recommend. It fits fine but I would have fine been getting my regular size as well. I think a lot of people are ordering this as a fashion piece and have never wore Carhartt before. Hence all the complaints and confusion about sizing. I am a working man and love all the T-shirts I have from Carhartt in large. Sure they are a little larger than a typical t-shirt but that gives you room to really move around and WORK. I went a size down for this and I suppose it fits fashion for how a jacket should fit but it doesn't cover my ass, which would be nice in the cold."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,The Perfect Heavyweight Hoodie,5,Very warm and comfortable with handy inside double pockets. Also a heavy duty main zipper and mine was made in the USA! Would definitely recommend this well made jacket.
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,This is a winter weather tamer!,5,"After reading several reviews, and then finally trying one on in store before purchasing, I knew I needed to order a size smaller than I typically would.  I've worn a black jacket with my work logo on it for several years and the long, cold, ND winters made me want something other than black for my daily wear jacket.  We've recently had temps well below zero for days (-20 or more with wind chills even lower), and I need something that can hold up to these temps.  This jacket does it!  It's a bit stiff at first but I have no doubt it will soften up over time.  The color is a great shade of red and it's very comfortable.  In typical Carhartt fashion, I expect to last for years."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Buyer beware.,1,"I received my Carhartt jacket yesterday (J140 in gravel) and almost immediately noticed a single 3 inch “vein” running up the right shoulder, it almost resembled a hard water stain. I washed the jacket according to Carhartts recommendation (gentle cycle, mild detergent, tumble dry, low heat).I removed the brand new jacket from the dryer and found these veins resembling hard water were now all over the jacket from the hood to the waistline! It looks like a stone wash or acid wash finish from the 80’s... it’s terrible.Carhartt was willing to inspect the jacket for defects, but stated that my size won’t be in stock for 9 months and offered no other solution.Ultimately if you’re buying this jacket for work the rugged construction will serve you well, if you’re buying this for it’s aesthetics and expect a new looking jacket you will be sorely disappointed.I’ve been screwed out of $109.00 and left with a jacket that looks as if it is 10 years old."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Most awesome jacket, I've owned!",5,"Always loved Carhartt. This jacket is awesome when it comes to not just being comfortable, but also for warmth. The outer layer is made to seriously protect against the wind and that's half the winter battle. The inner layers while not super thick is perfect especially with the addition of a sweatshirt or basic long sleeve shirt against the cold. Been my favorite jacket for years. Definitely recommend everyone has one. Good for cool days up to including extremely cold days"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Regarding fit, quality & shipping",4,"Fit: I am 5' 11"" and 165 pounds and got the large. It's a bit too big in the body but the sleeves are a tad short and I'd like it longer in the body so I'm re-ordering it in large long. I will update this review once I receive the large long.Quality: It's good Carhartt quality. It's a bit stiff and the zipper is so-so - I've had 3 Carhartt jackets and they could for sure improve their zippers. Their zippers seem beefy and durable but they don't work smoothly.Shipping: Slow shipping from DUNGAREES. I ordered it on December 26 and received it on January 4.Update: I received the large long and it's a better fit for me. The sleeves are not at all too long. The length does extend to cover up half of my butt which I don't mind. A medium long might work for my build as well but maybe wouldn't have room for layers underneath."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Great product, great price",5,"WOW, I had forgotten how great these Carhartt coats and jackets were!  A real quality product.  Heavy canvas, with a brass zipper that lasts and lasts.  This is a 'work' jacket, built to take a beating.  Heavily insulated, with great cuffs to keep that cold sucking wind out in the winter time.I wear an extra-large regular length outer coat, most of the time, so that's what I ordered.  Oh...not a good decision.  This coat is easily a small 2x or a super-large xl.  Rather than taking the trouble to return & ask for a smaller coat - I'll just keep this one.  It's a winter coat, so the extra room might come in handy....  AND the price!  GREAT!"

Still holds in heat (reason why I went with this jacket)Use:I ride my road glide with a sweater under at 40 degrees, ride is cold but not dyingNeeds to be broken in with time. Give it 3 washes and there you go. A comfortable jacket. Good luck guys and hopefully you don't go through 3 orders before you get the one you want"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Absolutely ginormous, not made for fit or average build people.",3,"Way too big! When they say “true to size” they must mean for people who are on the heavier side. I wear an XL in everything (I’m 6’1”, 207lbs), and have since I was in high school. I am relatively fit ie, no belly, and this thing in an XL can fit two of me, literally. The length is extremely long. I ordered an XL the first time, then a Large Tall, which was STILL too big. So I order a medium tall and it was STILL too big. I feel like a Small Tall would work for me, but after having to make 3 trips to amazon books to return, I’m over it. I literally haven’t worn a small anything since elementary school. So if you’re not overweight, have an extremely large build or looking to layer this with multiple sweaters underneath, this is NOT the jacket for you."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Perfect after a heavy duty wash and dry!!,5,"I bought the navy 2xl tall and at first i thought it was too big and that it looked a bit ""ballony"" on me when i wore it, im 6'2 280lbs, not a big belly or anything like it, i just have a bigger chest and shoulders as ive always hit the gym as a hobby. I wanted something comfortable that would allow me to layer up and not feel thight if i had to. And with this jacket at this size it was perfect! Until i decided to trow it in the industrial washer and dryer we have at work after 2 months if regular use, a heavy 35min wash with heavy duty detergent and softener and an equally 35mins of heavy duty drying, the jacket felt more normal than before. It shrunk the perfect amount and now it fits like my leather 2xxl tall jacket fits. Perfect at the chest and shoulders, arm length is great and about 2inches below waits line. It doesn't ""ballon"" anymore and it feels soft, about as soft as a duck canvas jacket can ever feel. Its been great so far and even better after that heavy duty wash and dry. I work overnight maintenance at a 5 acre resort and i do most of my get around and work outdoors and during the winter it gets down to a chilly 30 and this jacket is perfect, keeps me warm and is still large enough to layer up if i have to and still have free movement. Like i said, at first it seems and looks a bit too large compared to other same size jackets, but give it a good wash and dry and it will feel like the best jacket ull ever own."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Fraying,4,"My husband LOVES Carhartt, and he was badly in need of a new jacket. I bought this one to replace a ""Wall's"" brand jacket, which was similar in material, but sold at Wal-Mart for far less money. The Wall's jacket had lasted him a really long time (battery acid finally sent it into the garbage), so I had hoped a Carhartt brand jacket would last even longer. It's been just under four years now, and it isn't quite living up to my expectations. The cuffs are fraying and separating from the jacket, which has little holes all over it (not from battery acid this time, just from wear), and it perpetually smells like a campfire, despite the number of times it's been washed."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Pragmatic Choice in Coats,5,"I purchased my first Carhartt about four years ago and it is now my coat for doing projects that might get messy.  I purchased this new one to use for those tasks not likely to get messy.The new coat is, as expected, stiff but that will change with wear - it is comfortable in Pacific Northwest winters with a thermal t-shirt or sweatshirt underneath.  The hood is functional in cold weather and in rain.The fit is perfect for me because I am not adding multiple layers underneath it.  If you need multiple layers, it might be better to buy the next size up.I have worn this coat (original one) in mild Spring and Fall weather without overheating.It is a very practical coat and not intended to be a fashion statement, per se.  That being said, it can be worn anywhere you want with, maybe, the exception being a night at the opera or other such formal occasions."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Hard to please,5,"My husband is a technician and works outside a lot. This jacket is THE BEST jacket for cold and/or wet conditions. He needs to be able to move around freely and reach for things. He isnt wearing this jacket as a fashion statement. It 100% serves a perfect purpose for people who need a long lasting quality jacket that allows for movement. He has zero complaints. He is 5'9"" and about 190lbs. Got a large and it's perfect. He wears a large in everything so we were not swayed by the other reviews to size down. He could probably gain 10 lbs and it would still fit but it's not huge on him at all right now. If you're buying this coat for it's intended use for work, get your normal size."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Absolute no brainer,5,"Fits just like it should. Tough as an Outback steak. Water beads up and rolls off. YKK zipper. Very, very warm. Two inside pockets, one zipped and one Velcro. Side slash pockets are big enough for a man wearing light gloves to actually use. It’s Carhartt . It’s made in the USA 🇺🇸. And it’s under a $100. Are you really still thinking about it????Just order it. Do it now! lolI’m 5’11” and 200 lbs. Large fits perfectly.Very highly recommendThanks for reading"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Best jacket I've ever owned!,5,"I've had a lot of jackets, nice ones too, and this one tops them all in terms of comfort and warmth.I'm only 5'11, 180 lbs, but I ordered the Large - Tall because I hate it when jackets ride up above my waste when reaching overhead.The sleeves are a little long in the Tall version (according to Carhart it adds 2 inches to the length of the torso and sleeves), but the cuffs are elastic so they stay at my wrist and the extra length just bunches up a little and works perfectly fine.The Large at my height/weight leaves enough room for winter weather clothing underneath. It's a perfect size for me!Great jacket if you're looking for durability, comfort, and warmth!"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Great quality as expected, Same size as my Large J130",4,"I've been wearing Carhart jackets for 30+ years. My last similar heavy jacket was a J130, that I've had for about 15 years. It was certainly worn, but still OK for the farm. The out packets have large holes and the zipper finally broke, which was the last straw. Most certainly got my monies worth...more than happy with it.I was 'hoping' that a medium tall would be a bit smaller in the chest and waist and longer. The length is great, but the size is a large. I think in most people thinking, a MEDIUM tall, would be a medium in girth, and longer in arms and length down. What I got was a longer size Large. I think others have stated the same. Not sure why Carhart thinks a Medium should be a 50"" waist! Yes, I measured it. Here is the size chart for Medium Tall - Chest 40 Waist 34 Hip 40. Obviously not even close!That said, I still like the coat and will wear it for years to come."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Recommend,5,"My husband loved this coat! He’s normally a 2x and I’m happy I got the 2x tall, because it fits him perfectly! I read the reviews and seen that ppl said it was oversized and I was worried it would be too big on him in 2x tall, but like I said it fit perfectly in his normal size he usually gets! He’s 6ft and 230lbs. Really recommend these coats, kept him warm!"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Thick thick and thick....read more.,1,"This was a very uncomfortable jacket. I bought it because I needed to be warm in cold temps.. ie 20 to 45 degrees. The jacket is unbearably heavy in weight however.The material is so stiff, you can actually stand it up on its waist.I ended up returning it after buying what I really wanted at Bass Pro Shops. The jacket I ended up with was one made by Red Head. It was made of a similiar heavy duty cotton material as this one, but it's much softer or more relaxed. It sits comfortable when wearing it. It's also got a quilted inside material that helps hold in heat....and the entire jacket is lined with it...including the arms and hood. Only 75 bucks. Go get one now."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Not what I thought it would be,2,"I’ve wanted a Carhartt jacket for a long time and I finally made the jump, boy was I disappointed. I’m 6’ 225lbs and the large was big on me. It would have been okay if I wanted to wear a sweatshirt underneath but I bought this jacket so I would have to do that. The arm length was maybe a touch long but length in the torso I found to be shorter than I would like. All this being said by far my biggest problem was with the hood. It doesn’t lay flat on the back at all. It was so big and puffy I felt like it was pushing my head forward when I was just standing there, very uncomfortable. I’ll be returning mine."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,100% solid buy. Made in USA,5,"Update: I did a light wash on the jacket. Put it in the 109 degree sun to dry. Didnt take long. Well, the right front pocket has all this white chalky color on it like it's faded?? It looks like a used jacket and I haven't even worn it yet. What gives??? Going to email the seller.I've used my friends hand me down carhartt jackets for some time. Most were xxl. Those jackets were huge in the chest and short in the arms and short in length.This is my 1st carhartt jacket buy. I'm 6'3 240lbs. Fairly fit since the corona-con lockdown. I wear an xxl shirt and jacket 9 times out of 10. My issue with those is arm length and torso length is a bit short . So I bought an XL LONG carhartt quilted flannel lined duck jacket and it fits me perfect!Hangs just below the belt. Little baggy in the chest which leaves room for a sweater if needed. The arm length is just a tad long which is what I need. I can lean over and the sleeves will not ride up to my mid forearms. Couldn't ask for a better fit honestly. I was suprised an XL fit. Again, add the LONG and it's just right. 100% solid amazon buy and MADE IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. THE USA!!"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Amazing, durable jacket!!",5,"I saw reviews that said this runs large so I got a size smaller but got the “tall” option because people said it might be too short when lifting your arms. This is for my husband for work and he is 5’9 about 200 lbs and it fits perfectly. Glad I went for the tall option, just to cover his midriff when lifting his arms. Amazing material, durable and warm, the inside is a nice, soft, cushiony material. Zipper is big and durable. Outside pockets in good place and inside zipper pockets are perfect. Hood is definitely big enough to cover head but not too large. All in all it is an amazing product and I would absolutely recommend to anyone I know, especially if you or someone you know works outside some of all of the time. Very happy with this!!"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Linded Duck Active Jacket,5,"Ok, I get a lot of Jackets in 2XL but read these are a little on the large side. Got an XL, it fits, but probably could have got away with a L and it would still fit nice. This Jacket keeps you very warm, to the point if you're in your car with the heat on, you're gonna be too hot. I can get in my car with this on and not use the heater, except when windows fog up. Zipper is a little stiff but rather have too stiff than loose.  I've been wearing this jacket ever since it arrived. Even when it's very cold, (20*) it's still nice and warm. Thought people bought these for some kind of fashion statement but it is very, very nice. If you aren't wearing something bulky under it, you can probably go one size down from your normal size."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Decent first impression,4,"First off I'd like to begin by saying that I've had the jacket for just a day just in time for our 1st cold spell to hit NYC this winter so these are my initial thoughts..  First the build, this jacket is and feels super rough which is a good thing, i can tell it can take a beating. The lining is more than adequate and crazy warm, i only used a long sleeve shirt on this 15 degree day. I've read reviews of people saying there isnt any inside pockets which isn't true, actually there's two, one zipper and one velcro. Second the hoodie, to put it short it'll drive you nuts, its huge and cumbersome, i kept smacking myself silly removing it from my face. However, it is warm and i assume after the breaking in period is thru things will fall into place. Lastly the length, i should've went with the tall version cuz its pretty short. If you have a bit or alot of stomach and youre over 6ft i suggest you go with the tall. Nonetheless I'd recommend it just for the toughness and warmth of the jacket..after all it's for work not for nightlife!"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great coat,5,"Bought for my 15yr old son. He wears a men's Med and athletic build. This coat was ordered in a med tall. Hits perfectly where I wanted it to be. Right under the hip area. This is a little baggy but what I expected. I wanted something he could grown into. He is growing fast. His dad is over 6' so I'm sure he will be tall as well. The quality is what's expected canvas work coat. Has enough room to wear a hoodie under. Solid construction, the tall in Med was definitely a good choice based on reviews. Nothing hangs out. Stiff but after it's broken in I'm sure it will be all good. Love that they have a tall option so nothing hangs out"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Love this J140 Carhartt jacket!,5,"I absolutely love this J140 Carhartt jacket! I’m 5’ 10”, a fairly solid 210lbs, and the large fits perfectly. This jacket is comfortable, very warm, and the nasty wind doesn’t stand a chance against it, which to me is half the battle. The hood isn’t huge, which I really like, and the zipper feels very strong. I don’t use this jacket for work, but rather as regular winter wear to stay warm. If I did need it for work I feel it would be great for that as well. The only thing I would prefer is a slightly deeper pocket on the left inside, as my phone doesn’t fit fully in it. Other than that, this jacket is perfect!"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,What I needed,5,"First off, these are cut large.  We originally ordered a XL but it was definitely too big.  I'm 5'8""  and I am 245 pounds.  I am an avid power lifter with broad shoulders a stocky build.  The large fits very well.  If you are going to layer under the jacket maybe the XL will work for you but the large was perfect.  Returning the XL for the Large was simple.  No issues at all.The craftsmanship is excellent.  Lot's of attention to detail.  This jacket will make you sweat if it's over 50 degrees out.  I tried it on in my house and in less then 5 minutes I was uncomfortably warm.  I use it when riding my motorcycle and it does an amazing job at cutting through the wind.I am very happy with the purchase."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,What happened to quality?,3,"Fits fine, but like everything else, I think the quality has gone done from the one I bought 20 years ago. The fabric seems lighter, the leather “C” patch has been replaced with a quilted nylon one, the zipper (which is what finally gave out on my old jacket, besides being worn through the sleeve ends) is thinner, and it’s definitely lighter and thinner than my old one, so less insulation too I’m guessing.Having said all that, it’s still the best work jacket on the market, it’s just not as good as it once was. It was once said “The quality remains well after the price has been forgotten”, but I fear I will still have the price in mind when this one wears out in a quarter of the time."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Returned For One Size Larger,4,"I have never had the pleasure of buying a Carhartt new, instead they were always hand-me-downs and in the wrong size from what I normally wear. My entire life I have worn a size Small, but it wasn’t until the past few months I started transitioning into a size Medium - not because I’m getting bigger, but because I’m getting older and I have come to love things a little baggier these days. I read reviews for days and the common review was that these jackets fits true to size with extra wiggle room for layering underneath. I thought to myself ‘Perfect! I’ll stay with my normal size then. A small.’ It was delivered in perfect condition. After trying it on though, I realized I should have bought my new found love for Mediums. All I could think about was how I wish it were just a little larger because I love to wash and dry all my clothes on hot water and high heat. For the purpose of keeping this jacket for many years to come, I returned this beauty and I now plan on purchasing a Medium instead. Until next time, Carhartt..."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Wonderful coat - comfy, warm, quality. Best gift a parent could give to a college student.",5,"As others have said the product was a size down than normal. I typically wear medium things and got the small. The waist is perfect especially with the taper from the cloth ruffles. The sleeves stop at the waist and the cuff things go 2” past so also perfect. The jacket is very warm. I wear it alone down to freezing maybe a bit lower, with just a t shirt. The jacket is a bit stiff in materials and it is very spacious despite being a small (read: I could fit another jacket and sweatshirt UNDER it; and could not fit the Carharrt under my winter parka because it was so Volumeous). I love it. It looks smells feels works great. Inner and outer pockets are spacious and wonderful. The velcro sticks to the inner material which makes me regret the quilted design. The zipper is kinda poopy in that it doesn’t zip/unzip very well, as well as feeling kinda plasticy. I’ve ripped a fingernail on it by not being careful and hurt my cuticles a few times. Here’s my ratings.In terms of this being my first carhartt, I am 10/10 satisfied with it. I’m so happy to have something so sturdy, warm, fashionable, and fun to wear.In terms of understanding the quality behind things - I feel guilty giving it less than a 10 but the zipper is kinda dumb and the velcro pocket isn’t my favorite. So we’ll say 8/10 on those regards.If we factor in delivery and packaging and presentation out of bag (no loose or torn threads; the material isn’t creased; it loosens up some in flexibility) then I’d give it a 10/10.I love my new coat. Will upload pictures shortly."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Still breaking it in,5,"I have been looking at Carhartt jackets for a long time.  I have several other Carhartt products including bib overalls, vest, and heavy zippered sweatshirt.  All have met expectations.  This jacket material is as heavy (and, right now) as stiff as the bib overalls when they were new.  I expect to be able to wear this jacket for all outdoor activities when the temp falls below 32 degrees.  I am breaking it in by leaving it in the back of my jeep with ""stuff"" piled on top of it until the seasons change.  I am 6' #207.  I ordered a large."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great WORK Jacket,5,"At first I thought it was a little big. Then I read into it and it suppose to be roomy for work. Thats why I got it. I do metal finishing for a living so I need something durable that will last more than a year. I think this will do wonderfully. I work in the worst environment for keeping your cloths top quality. 2 months in, after brushing against 1000 degree parts (which would melt a hole in any normal clothing) and working around chemicals constantly, it’s still in great condition. I recommend if i you want something heavy duty. This is not a fashion statement, this is a MENS jacket. That is all."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,My last Made in USA Carhartt,5,"Yeah, I am pretty sure this will be my last Made in USA Carhartt, if it holds up to the reputation that is... I purchased the XX-Large and it fits how I expected, a bit loose to allow one of their zip up Hoodies under it easily.  This model is warm, nice and I was fortunate to find my size to be still ""Made in USA""!  I must admit this is not an easy task anymore with Carhartt ... Mostly Imports, even in the same product design by size. You could look at one size saying ""Made in USA"" and change just the size and it becomes an Import product. Very sad for American workers..  I wish they would do more than 10-12% USA made for their asking prices... ohwell."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great Made in the USA Work Coat,5,"This is a replacement for my 12 year old Carhart.  It was just getting comfortable and I wore it almost every day but my wife thought I should look a little better attired when in public.  The quality is exactly what you expect from Carhart.  The quilted lining makes it comfortable in near zero temperatures.  The chest is sized loose enough to accommodate layering a tee shirt, shirt, and a sweat shirt.  All without binding.  That is in addition to the additional belly fat that I should loose.  As typical for Carhart canvas based coats, it is stiff and difficult to zip.  But that goes away when properly seasoned.  When it wears out, I would buy another."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,What COLD and what Wind?,4,"Bought an XL instead of a L like my husband generally wears. It turns out he liked the loose fitting Carhartt jacket that the XL gave him, so he could move around easily while working on his projects.. The first jacket I ordered, the zipper did not work easily at all. The 2nd jacket the zipper worked perfectly. It is a heavy duty metal zipper.. The jacket falls naturally on the hip area. You can pull it down more though. The fabric is absolutely great. Rain water seems to roll right off. It's also a very nice feeling and a very warm jacket. Then, there's the hood. Oh thank goodness for the hood. It makes a HUGE difference when you have a cold, windy day pop up on you. What wind?"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Durable, warm, and Stiff",3,"Size wise this jacket is good, the canvas shell material is sooo stiff, this jacket definitely needs a break in period to soften up. Feels like it’ll be good for the winter jobsite, and I can’t imagine anything being more durable"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Simply the BEST!,5,"5’9 200lbs and the XL fits perfectly. I love this jacket so much I just ordered a second one that won’t be used for work.I bought my first one in a home improvement store called Friedman’s. When I decided to get a second one about 6 months ago the store where I bought it from didn’t have them in stock anymore. I was really disappointed. I couldn’t find them on Amazon and had all but given up the search when I decided to adjust the search settings on Amazon to $100-$200 dollar range Carhartt jackets and low and behold it popped up. I made sure it was made in America, 100 percent cotton since my other one was and it turned out to be the exact match.So I jumped on it.This coat it’s so good at blocking wind and cold that I will never be without one again.Absolutely the best jacket I’ve ever owned."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Awesome Jacket; buy smaller than usual,5,"These jackets are a must have. This is only my second Carhartt I’ve owned (first one I owned for 10 years before the zipper broke). The material was still solid even with a broken zipper, so these things last a very long time. Similar to everyone else, I highly suggest buying a smaller size than you would think. I originally got an XL ignoring that advice, and it was HUGE. I wear all my weight in my stomach and chest and I was swimming in the thing. It was also very short (initial buy was an XL regular, and it barely made it to my waist with my arms down). I refunded/replaced with a Large Tall, which hangs about 28.5 inches down from my shoulders, and perfect for me.These things are built like a tank. They’re quite stiff and resistant to a lot of abuse, but that is what I want with wood and steel working. They are completely worth it, and made in the USA."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great jacket!,5,"I owned a Carhartt years ago and I remembered it being fine. I decided I needed a new winter coat this year so thought hey, maybe I'll give Carhartt another shot. I'm glad I did because I'm pretty impressed with this coat! The hood is nice, the cuffs are fine, the deep pockets are good for gloves, and the zipper is solid if a bit stiff. I do wish it could zip up higher like some other coats do but that's not a deal braker. It does help in the wind. Central Connecticut winters are pretty mild compared to northern New York but even though it doesn't get to 20 below here, it can still be pretty windy and it can hit zero. The material is really tough. You know as soon as you unpack it that it could stand up to a lot if required! If I were someplace colder, I would consider moving up to whatever their next warmest offering is... I'm 5.9 and 245 pounds. I wasn't sure if I should go for the large or the xl. I decided to go with the xl and although the sleeves are a tiny bit long and the coat itself is a bit too big, I think it was the right choice because I can put a fleece or something else on underneath with no trouble. The large may have been more of an exact fit but then layering may have been a tad uncomfortable. All in all, I'm very impressed and will buy another one at some point!"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Great jacket, size down and go with tall if over 6’",5,Got for my guy who’s 6’3” 250 pounds. Bought a size down from his normal XL and got the L tall instead. Was definitely the right decision. This jacket absolutely runs large width wise but not super long. If you’re over 6’ tall go with the tall sizing and don’t be afraid to size down. Even sizing down he can still layer with a sweatshirt with room to spare. Other than sizing this jacket is perfect and keeps him warm in our current 12 degree weather.
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Unless you’ve bought Carhartts before, buy 2 sizes smaller!",3,"My boyfriends 6’5 200 pounds we ordered the X Large looking at all the reviews to compare people around his size and weight to get the right fit. When we got the first Jacket it was way too short higher then his belt line but he looked super puffy like the marshmallow man from ghostbusters. Then we ordered the same jacket but a large tall, the length was right but he couldn’t walk through some aisles of some stores we visit frequently without knocking stuff over, so now I’m going for a medium tall which is weird because he doesn’t own anything smaller then an XL for any top from any other brand. I’m a fashion designer so I took measurements beforehand and still way too big, carhartts fit models are probably on the shorter and stockier side. So my advice is start with 2 sizes smaller and work you’re way up or you might end up like me, and returning a jacket I’d really love to keep, twice..."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Didn’t hold up in warehouse !!! NOT good quality !!!!!,1,Not good quality shredded my sleeves and the front were the pockets are working in warehouse picking up boxes in just a few months after buying. Terrible for Carhartt and quality standards and for 100$ I expected more from carhartt
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Not sure if I'm just a lucky winner but....,1,"Was excited to receive this from Amazon now that the weather has turned cold and snow is starting to fall.  Opened up the box and took it out of the sealed packaging and put it on.  Seemed warm, maybe a bit large around the mid section, but over liked it.  Put my hands in the pocket and found a Bic lighter inside of it!!!!!  Not sure if Carhartt is running a new promotion where you but a jacket and get a free lighter with it or what, but was definitely disappointed in finding that.  Not sure if this error was on the Amazon side of things, or Carhartt, but either was left wanting more of a brand ""new"" jacket.  Will be returning ASAP"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great Carhartt jacket and value,5,"Great Carhartt jacket and value that will hold up and last for years of use.  My previous one held up for about 10 years of both casual and weekend house DIY building projects, etc.  Sadly, this recently ordered jacket fit tight across the chest/shoulders, short in the arm sleeves, and loose around the waist and mid section.  Tried on a size larger without resolving the sizing issue.If you're interested in a great jacket that's warm, durable, and a great value, I would definitely recommend checking out this Carhartt J140 jacket."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Super nice lining.,5,An awesome quality jacket for the price. I bought mine slightly used for 47 bucks. You can't do better than that for this jacket. It's in perfect condition.
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,🌟Great jacket for men and women - with update🌟,5,"❤️Update: Red Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel LinedAt the bottom...I love this jacket! I'm a gal and it is just a great jacket! I had one like it before and it was blue and I had it on for 30 years before it was stolen. People can say all kinds of things yet I will tell you that this jacket will keep you warm and comfy and the red makes it a little more feminine. I still think a guy would look good in red one too! It has pockets and a great zipper and you can layer underneath it. I'm so glad I had the red and did so much better than the one for women. It fits as expected. Thank you Amazon.com!Update:February 2021 : Large fits 36  to 38 inch waist.Extremely comfortable and warm!Red is my favorite- please bring back the colors!This one was also stolen and I can’t get it out of the pawnshop. It look like new and was warm as can be. Fit great, looked great- stolen....Amazon ., please find some decent colors. I don’t want to wear gray or brown. Yet the men’s coat fit so much better than the ladies.With the company as big as Amazon you should be able to get more great jackets!- Smile and be safeThank you Amazon.com!❤️"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Too Small,3,"I bought this as a replacement to my old Carhart jacket.  I used the same exact style number and size found on my tag.  Same size, same style.  This is shorter (my old one came down below my waist) and tighter in the chest (I can barley zip this up).  I loved my old jacket, but Carthart must have changed the size between the old and new jacket.  I have had the old jacket for about 10 years so i got a good life out of it.  I am 5'6"" and 140 pounds, so a medium would be too large and this small is too small :("
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Weird sizing,4,I had a carhartt sherpa jacket for a few years and it needed replacing so I ordered this one. The fit of this one is way different than the sherpa one. I usually wear an xl and that's what the sherpa jacket was and it was almost perfect but I got this one in an xl and I was swimming in it. It fit like a 3xl so I returned it and got a large and it still seems a bit big around the chest area while being a little shorter. I'm afraid if I go to a medium (which I'm sure would fit as far as the chest goes) it will be to short for what I want. So I'm going to return this one as well and just get something else entirely. Not sure why it's so different from the other carhartt jacket but it is.  I will say it seems well made though.
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Ruined after the first wash!,1,"See the picture I included. This is what happened when my husband washed the jacket ALONE in a new washer according to the manufacturer's specifications. We don't have an agitator in our washer, either, as I hate how they can destroy clothes.The sleeve was unexplainably, instantly damaged and torn, and this strange white stain is now stuck to the underside of the arm. A once beautiful gift was ruined after its first wash. My husband was thrilled with it when he got it, but I would advise other potential buyers to look elsewhere, try REI.com for actually durable outerwear."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Buy a size smaller than you are but great coat overall,4,"The quality of the coat is great, and paired up with my rain defender hoodie it has been super warm  but the sizing runs big or i wouldve given it 5 stars. If you wear a large in carhartt hoodies than buy a medium in this coat, i read a few reviews saying to buy the same size in tall but the large tall is way too big for my normal use. Im 5'11 and 217lbs with a 44"" chest and this was way too loose on my frame. Keeping it for repairs under my truck and four wheeler but picked up a medium in the store that was a perfect fit, not loose but not too tight either"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,6'0 195lb size Medium Fits great,5,"First Carhartt jacket, have been wearing it for a few weeks now. The fit and feel is roomy, heavy, and very very stiff. Not constricting at all like most winter jackets plenty of room under for layering but not so much room for cold draft.  I was originally concerned about the stiffness and how uncomfortable it was when first trying it on. But after a wash and few weeks of wearing the jacket it has broken in nicely. It may shrink very slightly when drying too hot as the cotton fibers tighten up but get loose again after wearing.  Only concern is the elastic cuffs wearing at the ends over time but hopefully not before many good years of use."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Great jacket, I'm happy with it",5,"Great jacket, I'm happy with it. I wish the front pockets were larger but they are adequate. I'm 6' 195lbs 46"" chest - I ordered a large because x-lg jackets seem a bit oversized on me and other's reviews indicate these Carhartts run large. The lg. fits me nicely but I don't have  the longer arms that most 6 footers have. I was told by Carhartt's chat on their website that this jacket with it's firmhand duck is not expected to shrink more than 2-4% if directions for washing are followed. So I might regret getting the large as it can't afford to shrink on me arm length wise. Maybe I'll try washing it in cold water instead of warm and dry it on gentle instead of medium."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,I love carhartt but smaller sizes would be good,5,"I am a huge fan of Carhartt jackets. They are so sturdy, warm, and comfy. I loved this jacket so much but I was just too big on me. I was swimming in it even though I ordered a small so I had to return it. I wish Carhartt had an extra small available. If they did, I would absolutely buy it. I know there are women's sizes that are smaller, but I couldn't find anything that had the quilted flannel in solid black."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Layers for days,4,"This is heavy duty hoodie, I can put a sherpa jacket underneath it and be warm in 0 to 20 degree weather. It's thick which is great for blocking out the wind chill. The fit is oversized for mobility and stacking layers of clothing. Sizing down maybe a bit restrictive in movement. Zipper is stiff when zipping it up, about a few inches in it feels like it snags. One of the side pockets is slightly misaligned not obvious unless closely inspected. Overall, this hoodie has kept me warm and toasty during the winter season."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Runs big,5,"I am a smaller guy, 5'5 145-150, smaller frame. This jacket fits big, but that's fine because if you need this coat you're gonna be dressing in layers (thermal, hoodie, heavy flannel etc.) which would work well with this coat fitting over your other layers. Heavy set, yet feels light and agile. Keeps in the heat. Would not recommend if you're an auto mechanic unless you take your gear off after work as it will stain the coat, the stains may go away, but the smell does not. Great winter coat!"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Cheap fabric,2,"The jacket itself is okay. We originally ordered a size large, his normal size, but it was too big. We exchanged it for a medium and it fit well. However, the covering on the inside of hood is made of poor material. He wore the coat only once and a small hole developed on the hood exposing the underlying interfacing. Very disappointing to say the least. My husband has had a few Carr hart jackets and they were good for functionality and longevity. This one is cheaply made."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Extremely well-made, but no secure pockets",4,"This jacket is high quality, very well made. The zipper is big and sturdy, not the tiny things that many jackets seem to have today. The jacket is very warm, i.e. if it is not in the 40's F (~5C) or lower, you will probably need to unzip it. That said, when it is near freezing and windy, it works great. The fabric wears very well. I seem to end up on the ground on my back to fix or adjust lots of equipment, and so far, the jacket has not shown the wear and tear.I am 6' 2"", 200 lbs. and the large/tall fits just fine.The only con I have is that there are no secure pockets. That is nothing that buttons, snaps, zips, velcros (is this a word?). Not even an inside pocket. This is why I give it 4 stars. The two outside pockets are good for gloves and a wool cap, or your hands, but not for anything like glasses, keys, etc. that might fall out if you are outside working."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Quality and fit????,4,"The quality is great well made. However, a bit larger than expected. I read in some reviews that the size's were off, that the jackets run big. I wear an XXL (5'9"", 240 lbs) so I ordered a XL.  It fit great, but the shoulders were a bit larger. Looks like I have small football shoulder-pads on. Something I can live with because once the jacket breaks in the shoulders should droop and thus fit and look better.  Arrived very stiff, but I associated that with the good quality. It's the kind of jacket the more you wear it the better it will break in and fit.  I'm glad I ordered one size smaller."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"This is a great, quality coat",5,"This is a great, quality coat! I've worn this up in Northern Maine in the winter and still wear it some days in the Spring here in the South. It's been comfortable through the last few months and it still looks brand new even after nearly daily use. I've been out in the snow, rain, wind and the occasional hail storm and have been comfortable in most situations. This is part of Carhartt's USA-made line of clothing and the quality and craftsmanship shows. The price difference from buying it online or at the local stores was only a few dollars but this was the only place I could find that had them in stock in my size and in the classic Carhartt brown. I would buy again without question but I suspect that I won't have to."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Worth every penny!,5,"I'm 6 foot, 165lb. Ordered the medium/tall. It fits just right. And by that I mean it feels a little big, but not so big that it's cumbersome or impedes movement, but big enough that I could wear it over another hoodie/jacket/whatever in case I really need to double up, while still being very comfortable with just a t-shirt underneath.This thing is awesome. Sturdy and warm. Almost feels like wearing light armor. I love the heavy duty zipper. Feels like it's really going to last. Ordered in gray because it was the only version available at the time that was made in USA. And indeed tag says made in Union workers in the USA.Be sure you check the description on the page after you select the color/size you want to be sure you're getting one made in USA, if that's important to you ;)Totally worth the money. 10/10"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Huge, like 3 times larger than I expected.",5,"Carhart quality but man the fit was way off. I'm using my phone to review so I'm not sure if this is the large or medium (I had to return the large) but the large fit like a 3X at least. This thing was huge, I mean like put it on a cow to keep it warm in Siberia huge. I have an older Carhart that's a large and it fits as I expect. I know I'm not built like The Rock (Chris Rock, maybe) but I probably could've wrapped it around twice and still zipped it. I'm 6', 165lbs and the large was ridiculously overwhelmingly massively huge."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great coat but the hood is cumbersome.,4,Great coat. The only problem is the hood. It won’t lay down. It stands up along the back of my husband's head no matter what we do to flatten it out. We’ve put it in the dryer but it’s still stiff.
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Warm and Tough,3,"This coat is warm, even in 18 deg, windy weather. The exterior shell is tough and tear resistant. Perfect for outdoor working and activities in cold weather. My problems with this jacket are 1) the zipper. I've owned a number of Carharts and the zippers always seem to have issues... they have a tendency to stick or jamb. And 2) the hood. The hood doesn't fold or collapse. So if you're driving, it constantly nudges the back of your head, or, if you're wearing a hat, and bend down, it will push the hat off your head. Very annoying.  But it's very WARM."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Still warm, and Still Kicking",5,"Just as comfy as my last one, and just as though. Excellent work jacket for construction in cold climes. I was so warm at -38F that my safety glasses wouldn’t take more than a few seconds to ice up. So I had to take my glasses off to keep from cutting my fingers off. Safety man warned me to put them on, or I was down the road. Lose lose situation. That jacket kept me warm all the way back to my lay-off check."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Outdoor winter coat, made to last? Yes please!",5,"HELL YES, in short above all the jackets I was looking to get. An needing something rugged, an durable.I couldn't have stumbled on to something any better. I'm 5,10 -11ish215Lbs, the large was perfect. If I got a XL, it would have been extremely to big an baggy."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Good work jacket,5,"Wanted a hybrid jacket/hoody, this jacket is pretty heavy duty for winter use. I live in Florida and I am a regional truck driver traveling mostly southeast only. I don’t exactly need a super heavy duty jacket but this will do if you need a work duty winter coat. Overall satisfied. I am 6’3 and I am 230lbs the jacket sized large/tall fits me too perfect. I typically will buy either large or extra large jackets or tops depending on my weight, right now I’m larger than I usually am so if you’re expecting to need a extra large or I would try the size smaller"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Carhart durability and warmth,5,"When you pay for the best, you get the best. Expect it to be stiff and bulky. That's what it takes to provide the warmth and durability Carhardt provides."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Rugged, Warm, and Versatile",5,"This jacket is exactly what I was looking for. It’s rugged, durable, and versatile. I can easily wear a t-shirt underneath and overheat in 35 F weather. I originally ordered the Large Tall and the sleeves were too long for me. I ended up ordering the Medium Tall and it fits much better. The sleeves are a hair too long still, but overall, it fits very well. For reference, I’m 6’3” and 200 lbs."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great fabric,5,"Will have to wait until it's colder to start wearing, but this (J140) jacket was my favorite from the lineup. Classic canvas shell that feels very thick and durable. Will have to get broken in to loosen up a bit. Liner is soft flannel, doesn't feel snaggy. Sleeves are nylon which is great so your shirt sleeves don't get caught and bunch up.Overall size is what I expected, fits pretty true but is a hair baggy if anything so movement is very good. Sleeves are a hair baggy but I'm not complaining. I like how the waist and (mainly) wrist cuffs are stretchy so they seal off air, but aren't tight at all."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Zipper of Life,5,"It's a little big but I think we ordered it that way on purpose. I got this for my husband to work outside in the winter about 3 years ago. It's warm, soft, easily washed and dried in the the machine. It has a small pea sized hole in the front pocket after 3 YEARS. Also, the zipper may have saved my husbands life. Fell off a ladder, zipper caught a nail and was strong enough to hold my 170lb husband in the air and kept him from falling to the ground. Zipper is bent now. Still works great."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"The condition of this coat is pretty bad, there are so many scratches on the ...",2,"The condition of this coat is pretty bad, there are so many scratches on the surface of the coat. The size is a little too big but I think it's okay, the coat is really warm. However there are too many surface damaged that I really can't recommend this product if the quality is like this."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Bulky but good quality,4,"I am a slim person... 5'10 168lbs, so this jacket is bulky to me.  I also made the mistake of buying a jacket with elastic at the waist, which I find very unattractive.  So I simply bought the wrong coat.  Now, to those who might be a bit heftier, yeah this is a good coat.  Very strong fabric, well made.  But personally I like the chore coat... These jackets do run one size too big though, and I think its because they expect you to have on much more layers of clothing underneath."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Excellent,5,"Hands down the best jacket I’ve ever had. I tore an entire house that caught fire down to the guts in it (no heat). Smoke, spot, debris, water... brought it home washed it and it looks good as new. This thing is so damn warm, I can walk the dog at 1am without having to put a shirt on when it’s 15° degrees out. Completely warm the entire time. Can’t say enough about this jacket"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Medium tall fit better than expected,5,"My son is thin and just over 6'. Based on the other reviews, I was worried about the sizing. He usually wears a medium in regular clothes, but sleeves and torso tend to run short on him. Medium Tall fit better than I expected. Sleeves and torso were perfect length. Elastic was loose at the hip and it was big in the shoulders, but he loved it and said the extra room allows him to still move with a sweatshirt underneath."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Warm, well made, heavy utilitarian jacket.",4,"His first comment was  “I wish it didn’t have a hood”.  I bought this for my son in law to be (If he changes his attitude!) who is about 5’10” and around 260 lbs. I was looking for a 2X but after reading others reviews saw that the better option was to buy an XL Tall. Other reviewers said the wind blows up under the waistband on the larger sizes. I followed their recommendations and am glad I did. (Other than the hood) it fits him well and keeps him warm when working outside in Michigan in the winter. I’m sure he’ll get some use out of the hood, like it or not! i would recommend this style of jacket for any man who spends time outdoors in cold weather."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great Jacket!,5,"I have had this jacket for several months now and am very pleased with how warm it is even on cold blustery days. The jacket is well made, as I would expect from Carhartt, and the fit is nearly perfect for me (medium tall). I have long arms (35 inch sleeve length in shirts) and when I ordered the tall, I assumed the body of the jacket might be too long for my torso, which I could live with if the arms were long enough. I do wish the body of the jacket was an inch or two shorter but the arm length is perfect for me. Other than the slight issue with the length of the jacket, I am otherwise happy with it."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,To large for me,3,"To large at medium for me. I am 5' 8"", 180lbs. The chest is just right, with enough room for another light jacket/thick shirt. But the sleeves are very long and covered beyond my fingertips even with T posed. Also, the liner is not cotton, but polyester. I understand most sleeves are nylon for fit, but was expecting a similar material or cotton inside, not polyester."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Terrible Fit!,2,"I’m a big fan of the Carhartt brand and I was really looking forward to this jacket. I’ve never tired on a jacket with such a terrible for. Was designed for a stout round person with short arms. I’m 180 lbs, 5’ 10”. The medium sized jacket was so puffy it looked ridiculous. The arms were just barely long enough. Perfect for a short very round person."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great Quality,5,"I am 5’4.5”, 160 lbs. and the Small size fits me best. I initially bought the Medium size, but it was way too thick on me. The zipper is a bit difficult to zip On and off, but i think it will get easier as I use it.Overall, I am very pleased with the build quality. It feels like I paid a premium price for this jacket. It doesn’t get much colder than 30 degrees in SoCal so I can’t comment on how well it performs, but so far it’s kept my upper body very warm."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Amazing quality,5,"This is my second Carhartt jacket. My first carhartt was a gift from my grandparents when I was 15 and I still have the jacket and it's in great condition. The only problem is it got thrown down in the garage sometime while I was away in college a couple years ago and it I thought I had lost it. It is faded and has bleach stains all over it but it's actually still in perfect condition, it just doesn't look great as a jacket I want to wear out in public. Long story short, carhartt makes a great quality jacket. My new one is the gravel color and I expect it to last for years to come as well."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Best,5,"Im a 5'11"" woman and I bought medium/tall. They're not playing when you order the tall size, my hands stay in sleeve, which is what I like personally. Also, being tall/long, shi* usually irritatingly too short, and if I go bigger, stuff is too baggy. Im glad they have the sizing options they offer. When it comes to warmth, it definitely works well, in MI. It's great,  I'm happy."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Well worth it!,5,"I bought this for an everyday winter jacket. It’s the second one I have, I bought the first one with matching bibs for work last winter and was very happy. The jacket is very warm n with the bibs sometimes to warm n need to unzip both a little. Lot of these reviews  are saying it fades to easy and fast for the black or navy blue but I don’t buy mine for looks or to show off and play “country”. I live on a farm and buy it because how it performs and if it works and keeps me warm I don’t care what it looks like or what people think how I look. Would I buy it again? Yes do I recommend it if you’re looking for a warm work jacket or everyday jacket? Yes.My work jacket and bibs are black and have been washed about 4 times and there’s little to no fading, just fallow the care instructions and you’ll be good."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Used Dirty Jacket,1,"I just received the package and as soon as opened it, it has a guy cologne smell to it. It also has dog and human hair all over the jacket. Theirs what to seem blood spot on the inside hoodie. I thought I was receiving a NEW Jacket NOT USED. It didn’t come with any tags."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"I will order again, I wrote a review about this coat and it helped many, many people- runs large, please read my reviwes.",5,"Actually I ordered the Carhartt Men's Duck Active Jacket- Quilted Flannel Lined in a XL as I read many reviews to order in a size bigger, which I also ordered the matching Carhartt Men's Duck Active Bibs- Quilted Flannel Lined , they are true to color in brown, just as if you bought them at your local Carhartt store. I want to make this review all in one as I am able to write one for the 2 I did order. The first Jacket I ordered was a XL as my brother wears a size 34-35 X32 in jeans again I was reading order one size bigger,  normally he wears a L in most coats, standing 5'8 170 lbs, this XL swallowed him, however my husband is 6'3 at 252 lbs and it fit him great in a XL with moving room so he decided he wanted to keep the Jacket this is where the 2nd Jacket I ordered come in as I re-ordered a L for my brother so it worked out great! In Pictures looks as the Jacket and bibs are a bit lighter but they are matching in the brown tone. Very good quality, warm, quilted and sleeve length fits perfect, go with normal size when ordering this Jacket, the bibs please read my review as they are a bit different. I hope this with sizing helps others with their purchase. What a wonderful warm Christmas gift. Fast shipping, ordered on 11/1 was delivered on 11/4 to my door, you can't go wrong. Order in your size, bibs please read. Packing was neat and arrives in plastic and a very secure box."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Comfortable, warm and tough",5,"Just as the other reviewers have said, this does run a bit big. I am 6'1"" 280 lbs and the 2xl is just a tad big on me, but I think the Xl would be too small.  The jacket is extremely warm and comfortable. Word of warning though, I washed it and then dried it with some shoes to soften it up a bit. I read that other people have done it so i tried the same method. When I took it out after 2 dryer cycles on low heat, it looked like it was a few years old and still stiff. The edges looked like they were worn almost to the point of fraying. This could just be my dryer or the shoes I put in there, but I don't recommend it!  It was still pretty stiff afterwards anyway. Just wear the thing and I'm sure it soften up naturally. It's not that bad looking like you are sitting in a turtle shell while you are driving down the road!  I would buy it again."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Probably Carhartt's best piece,5,"I own a few Carhartt jackets and like them all, but this one deserves special recognition.It is warm with only a shirt in the 30° and up range.  Under 30° and with layering (which it is cut for) you can take it down to 0°.The length will not ride up when you sit and the cuffs and waist keep the cold out.  The hood is a perfect fit an not oversized as many are to fit a hardhat.Windproof and unless you are in a downpour (at which point it is probably too warm to wear) it is pretty water resistant for rain and snow.  The zipper comes up high enough where you may not need a scarf, and it is not uncomfortable.You can wear the black one into a club and not look like you just got off a construction site and it's not the type of coat people will seek out to steal if you leave It on the back of your chair.One final thing, it can take a sh1t-kicking and the more you do - the better it looks!"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great coat,5,"Warmest coat ever - it’s bulky, definitely not form fitting, but it keeps all the wind and cold out and the inner lining is super soft. Plus the outer material is tough, would be extremely difficult to cut or puncture accidentally."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Exactly what I was hoping for.,5,"I intentionally bought this jacket big enough to layer underneath it, and purposely bought it for a taller and bigger man than I am, to come down to my mid to upper mid thigh, as I do not like jackets that come to my waist. But I really like what I got. It's going to serve the purpose I intended it to."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Made in USA.  Great warm jacket6,5,"I got this for my boyfriend.  He loves it.  Only slightly odd thing is the hood. Its huge. You could wear a football helmet under it. Besides that, fit, color and the fact it's made in USA 🇺🇸  are all great factors."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great jacket.,5,I ordered a XXL Tall  so I need to lose weight  but this coat fits nice but a bit large.I`m okay with that. coat is as I expected it to be. I have had several Carhartts over the years.Great jackets but they do wear out..  I recommend Carhartt . Most of them are US made in a country that has literally no textile industry left.  Many of the other brands are good too that make like style Jacket.  This brand speaks for it`s self .
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Highly recommend!,5,I am 4'11 so I knew it would be big on me and that is part of the reason I wanted it. I have severe Raynauds which causes hypersensitivity to the cold but I work in the cold so I needed something that could stand hard work and keep me warm and this is it! No seams have came out or started to wear out. Excellent to wear a sweater underneath but I dont need it for how warm and dry it keeps me! I also deal with harsh chemicals and so far no discoloration has came up and I bought this several weeks ago. Highly recommend as a warm seasonal or work jacket.
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,A tiny bit large but its better that way,5,We love Carhart. They’re quality of product is unmatched. The jackets are always a little on the larger side but I feel that’s how they should be. My husbands jacket is a little large but it’s perfect that way; he loves it! We almost got the one without the hood but the little bit of extra money to get the hooded one was definitely worth it 🙌🏽
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Best jacket out there,5,"This jacket is amazing. I own one and got one for my son. THe older it gets, the better it gets. Starts out a little stiff but ""breaks in"" without losing its wind and cold protective qualities. This isn't just for outdoor workers and country folk, this is an amazing jacket regardless of where you wear it. Definitely worth every cent and because it'll last forever, it's a great investment. Buy one, you'll love it."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Carhartt Jacket Made Tough in the USA,5,"The tag said Made In The USA, no doubt of material from foreign lands, but we take what we can. Its Carhartt's classic jacket and heavy duty. Wish it was not so stiff but that's the way they are and will soften up with use. Looking forward to getting 10+ years out of it just like the old one."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great quality jacket!,5,"I really live Carhartt, this coat is no exception. Really rugged and well built. Its stiff but will break in soon enough. Very comfortable. I got the tall and I am glad I did. I am 6 3 and have long arms and the arms are plenty long so they dont creep up when I am moving around. Love it!"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Durable jacket,5,"This is my 3rd! in 20 years. Yeah I like it. Keeps the winter wind off me. While it's too heavy for lightweight backing, it's fine for a day hike or even an overnight outing. Adding a polar fleece vest improves it for colder weather.  This is by far my favorite jacket."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Nice, heavy duty work jacket made in USA!",5,"This is a nice, heavy duty work jacket. Was drawn to it since this particular Carhartt product is still made in the USA. We had a ""Made in America"" Christmas and this was perfect for my husband to work outside in the winter. He is around 6ft, 200lbs and I ordered this in a XL- tall and it fits the way he likes. There is enough room for layers underneath."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Very baggy arms and midsection,3,"This is a great coat, and Carhartt is known for their warmth. However, this coat nearly swallowed my 5’6” 150lb husband. I bought him a medium because that is his usual size, but the midsection of this coat was gigantic on his frame. The arms were also very loose and baggy. It didn’t even look like it was spacious enough for a base layer underneath - it was just huge. We sent it back and will just have to go to a local store for him to try a Carhartt jacket on in person in order to find one that fits him well."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Replace for Old Faithful,5,"Carhartt jackets are a must in this house. When our 15 year old granddaughter saw her Grandpa's old jacket, frayed front panel, torn pockets, she fell in love with it! Bleached from over the years to a pale gold color and tattered as it was she wanted it, so of course Grandpa passed it on to her. He also gave her the history of when he got it and why! So, his Grandma ordered him a new one and even though it's still being broken in Grandpa is happy and very proud his granddaughter valued the old one."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Warm as a mother's smile!,5,"Over the years I have purchased quite a few Carhartt items, including vests, hoodies and coats. Number 1-Carhartt, in my opinion make very warm and rugged items for the cold weather-that is their renown!  I am retired now, but that doesn't mean I don't still prefer warmth. Carhartt HASN'T retired from that!"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Made in America!,5,"Made in America!Great durable jacket with a nice warm quilted lining. Stitching is excellent, which holds this canvas construction workhorse together. I may never use the hood, but it's there if I need it, and it really doesn't get in the way.Worth every dollar paid!"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Carhartt J140,5,"Dig this jacket, out hunting in 18 deg. temps with no problem at all, this jacket is much stouter than the picture looks and material is very stiff, I think in aprox. 2 yrs when this finally broken in, it will definitely be my favorite jacket! and the tag states ""Made in USA"" big plus for me as well.I'm 5'6"" and 175 lbs, I like to tell myself athletic build, and I did get a medium jacket, it does fit a little big, but if you layer your shirts like I do when it's cold it fits perfect."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great coat if you have winter,5,For some reason by the picture I was expecting a coat that would be about the thickness of a Dickie's work jacket. But that it is surely not. It is more of a parka. Which isn't at all a bad thing since I was buying it for a winter jacket. It seems like it will be very warm and I am pleased with how it looks. If I had one small complaint it would be the hood which I can't seem to get to lay down as nicely as you see in the pictures but this could just be that is is brand new and not broken in yet and a bit stiff. Overall it feels like a very quality product at a very reasonable price.
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Nice Straitjacket,2,"Size fit just right but I imagine this is what being in a straitjacket feels like. Insanely stiff and uncomfortable. I had one years ago amd it was not this stiff- what happened?! Doing the cold wash with vinegar to see if it softens it. Otherwise, I’ll find a stuntman gig so I can use it in man-on-fire scenes."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Thick heavy jacket,5,"Amazing stuff, it appears this jacket will last for at least hundred years."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Durable as always,5,Same old active jacket I've grown to love they are stiff and will be stiff for a season or  but I expect it will be comfortable next year and for several years after that.  My last one was stolen out of my truck long before I wore it out
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,hartt to hartt,4,"I like the shoulder room in this jacket, it is big enough to wear a heavy shirt underneath without binding in the shoulders,Jacket is very warm and durable. Originally quite stiff,launders well and sort of breaks in like a new pair of shoes. Jacket is a little bit toward bulky and heavy but i think its worth the trade off for warmth and durability."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,had a great chance to try it out,5,"just received the jacket 4 days ago,,am 6ft,,200lbs,,ordered a large tall,,fit perfectly,,live in upstate NY,where its been very cold,,wind chills to 35 below,,had to great chance to try it out,,wore just a sweatshirt underneath,and didnt feel any wind or cold,,except face as it was exposed,where the jacket covered was comfy,it was as promised pretty stiff,there will be a break in period to soften it up some,i could not be happier,thank you Carhartt ,,i can see why your products are highly rated in customer reviews,will definitely buy more Carhartt products,it is money well spent and does what its suppose to do...i highly recommend."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great Product,5,"First time I purchased this brand.  I see them a lot at work.  Now I know why.  Excellent quality, tough fabric, wicks water away, and will last a long time.  A bit pricey but considering how long this will likely be worn, I think I got a good deal."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,J140 in blue,5,"6' 1"" with a 48"" waist and 54"" chest. Fit is a little snug at the shoulders but perfect everywhere else. I'm glad I got the tall especially in the arms As mentioned by others, the zipper is HD and will take time to break in. Well made jacket made in the USA."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Read the reviews...,5,"…so knew it would fit big, and XLT was perfect for my 6' 2"" 220 lb. frame.  Roomy enough to bulk up underneath, and without the problem so many other clothes I'm faced with have, that of being short-sleeved with an outstretched arm.Haven't had to wear it in weather yet, but I know it won't do much good below 20-30 degrees.  That has been tested.  I've also tested its waterproof capability by letting water soak in a small spot on the sleeve, and it held up great.  It would take extended time in horrible precipitation to dent the shell on this baby.  Your pets won't do it with their claws, either.  Tough jacket, built for time.Stiff, as others have noticed, but I was so prepared for cardboard that I was pleasantly surprised by the stiffness degree.  It'll probably be broken in by the end of the winter (I just got it) which means maybe 6-8 weeks.Color is a nice rich brown, on the verge of mustard but blessedly not crossing that line.Having trouble zipping it up, of all things, a minor inconvenience as I sooner or later get it done.  It's a heavy-duty zipper, natch, being Carhartt and all, but it is so far a the only stiffness on the jacket I've been unable to be happy about.The thing isn't going to win any beauty pageants, but if you like a good solid working man's jacket that you can keep for a while, this is a real good one.  Ideal between 35-55 degrees, rain or shine.  Got no problems with this jacket I can't get over."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Really warm and great for work.,5,"Great jacket, I’ve been wearing it for work outside in Montana during winter so it’s definitely warm. Needs a break in period, very very stiff and starchy when it arrives. After about a month or so it’s super comfortable and nice to wear for work."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Love it...2nd Carhartt Jacket.,5,"This is my 2nd Carthartt Jacket. The 1st just sort of wore out due to age, use, and some predominantly hard to remove stains. Love the inside pockets and how warm the jacket keeps you. Zipper can be a tad stubborn at times but this is a minor complaint vs. the overall high quality of the jacket. Jacket fits very comfortably; not to tight and not to loose."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Great Jacket,5,"Ordered this for my son, who is in adult Small shirts and sweatshirts. This seems a bit bigger than those, but love that it'll last longer as he grows. He says it's super warm, and the fleece is soft against his arms and neck."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Trash,1,I wear this jacket ONLY at a white-collar desk job and to get groceries. The elbows already have a hole in them. Complete GARBAGE. My walmart dickies jacket held up 20x longer at a 1/4th the cost. DO NOT BUY
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Husbands loves it and can’t wait to wear for winter,5,"It looks really nice on my husband and he can’t wait to wear it once it starts getting cold. It seems a little big and he always wears an XL. But it will be nice to have that little extra room to wear a warm, cozy flannel underneath for winter."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Better off going elsewhere for a men’s carhartt jacket,1,I ordered a similar Carhartt from Amazon for myself (female) which was 10$ more. The jacket I got was made a lot better with better fabric on the outside of the jacket. This is a hoodie not a jacket. Also fits very big. Personally think it’s a rip off.
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,To stiff to be functional.,3,"This is a very well made coat, the thing that I do not like about it is that it is so stiff that you can hardly move in it.  After wearing it for 6 weeks and being washed and dried several times, it is still as stiff as the day I bought it."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Not to size, runs really big.",3,"The jacket runs very BIG, I got a medium thinking I’d be ok, and it looks and feels like I’m wearing an XL, the Jacket is warm, but super puffy and big. I’d recommend getting a size or two smaller if possible. The hoodie is really firm and doesn’t go back, so it’s always on the back of your head, annoying when you have your hat backwards and the hoodie will pop it right off your head if you move pretty much. If I knew this,  I definitely would’ve purchased another brand, or style. Good luck!"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Carhartt Quality,5,Quality materials and workmanship as expected from Carhartt.  Perfect fit without binding anywhere and a roomy cut allows comfortable movement without restriction.  Generous hood provides good protection.  Quilted lining for warmth with room to layer over a sweatshirt if needed.
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Best jacket in the market for all around use!,5,Carhartt Jacket Just is the best in market for both durability and quality!  I’ve been a loyal patron of this brand and from outdoors activity to work and pleasure from sub-zero freezing Northern weather down to Southern comfort climate zones these jackets have NOT failed.  It is a proven jacket!  I love them and will keep on buying them.  Very satisfied and happy!  Kudo’s our to Amazon for keeping these jackets in inventory!  Great job Amazon!
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Sturdy, pretty warm, I should get years of use out of it.",5,"Like all Carhardt clothes this runs a bit big, as in I usually wear a xtra large tee shirt, but only a large with Carhardt. The jacket is descent, mid weight, very sturdy. The hood is bigger than my last jacket from them which is good as that hood was ridiculously small. Glad I bought it, it will serve me well for years."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Worth the money...,5,Great Coat.Practical Jacket.Id go into the artic tundra with my Jacket.  & I guarantee that it would / could save my life.The coat is quality & practical....  Perfectly blended & balenced....It is capable of sustaining life saving body heat....  & prevent the elements from damaging skin....
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Love this jacket!,5,"Love this jacket! I recently moved to a house on ten acres, so there is a lot of outdoor work to be done, and I needed something comfortable, warm and sturdy. The jacket was stiff at first, but after a wash and some wear it's breaking in nicely. I can tell this jacket will last me for years.Sizing advice from a woman - I wear a L/XL shirt and am a 40DD. After reading the reviews of how big it runs I bought the men's medium, and it fits perfectly. It's big enough to wear layers underneath and zip it all the way up, but it isn't so big that I feel like I'm a little kid wearing dad's coat."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,For ex-snow birds,5,"I bought two: Rust and Black.  Adult medium and adult small.  Both boys loved the warmth of these jackets.  Wearing to school (just recently opened), dirt bike riding and hunting.  For these guys 40 degrees was cold, so these jackets were perfect for them."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,It's a brick...house,5,"This jacket is no slouch. It definitely has weight but it certainly applies it well in blocking out the elements, wind especially. I had no problems staying warm with cooler early spring temperatures in our trip to France.I had no issue with the integrated hood. It fit well when needed and wasn't really obtrusive when not in use. This is a solid performer and I have really grown to appreciate Carhartt's quality.  Recommended."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"It's a nice jacket, but very puffy",4,"It would have been a great jacket had it fit properly. It fit my husband great in terms of jacket length and sleeve length, but it is very, very puffy and made him look double his size. He also found the large girth of the jacket too difficult to move around in as it seemed to swallow him and restrict his movements quite a bit."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Beautiful Jacket,5,"We returned the jacket ONLY because it was too warm and too big for my husband.  However, he did love the look of it and I have to agree. It's a beautiful jacket. Runs large so you might want to consider going a size down (maybe). I'm tempted to get myself one. =)"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Husband loves his new jacket!,5,"I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  At first I bought the XL for him.  According to Carhartt size chart he should be a 2XL (he has a 50"" chest), but with all the reviews saying it runs big I got him the XL.  It was swimming on him.  I returned it and exchanged it for the Medium size, it fits absolutely perfect and he is very pleased.  He had been asking for this for a while and he isn't disappointed! Wonderful jacket, very durable outer fabric with super comfy and warm inner lining fabric.  There are two pockets inside, one is zippered and one is velcro.  Both inner pockets are a decent size however the outer pockets seemed to just fit his hands.  The zipper is very stiff and heavy duty, I'm sure it will loosen up a bit with time.  Like everything else, takes a bit of wear to break it in.  All in all, super happy with this purchase and would definitely buy again."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Carhartt, made to last while looking good",5,"There really isn't much to say about Carhartt when you try it on it speaks for itself. MADE IN USA. Everything is of an incredible high quality. All the way down to the sticker in the pocket of which worker personally inspected your jacket (Cathy in my case). The jacket is so warm and fits great. The sizes run big so if you prefer a bigger jacket then buy your regular size but if you like something that is more fitted then buy a size down. I constantly get compliments on what a nice jacket it is, and I'll get compliments for a long time because it was built to last. I don't think I've ever been happier with a jacket I've bought. Carhartt rocks and so does amazon for offering such a great price on it. There's also nothing like getting a brand new jacket that no one has tried or has an annoying metal security pinned poked through the jacket somewhere. This made my Christmas."
CRYSULLY Men’s Fall Fashion Zipper Up Casual Windbreak Bomber Jacket Coat Army Green,"Great fit, good quality for the price.",4,"Great product for the price, after seeing some reviews I was skeptical but when I got mine it was perfect. A lot of people said you should order larger size Cos of the size difference between USA and China where it was manufactured, in 145 lbs and 5.9 ft. I usually wear a medium, but I first ordered an XL and it was too big, I returned it and reordered a medium and it fit as a glove. 👌🏾  Great for spring and autumn or slightly cold weather."
CRYSULLY Men’s Fall Fashion Zipper Up Casual Windbreak Bomber Jacket Coat Army Green,Warm this winter,4,"I accidentally ordered the wrong color because the picture or the dark grey looked so close to the black, and was listed first, but that was my fault alone. I'm 5'8"" 260lbs lery muscular chest and arms with a very large belly. The XXL I received is snug but comfortable with room to move. The arms are a little smaller than expected. If I had to order again, I would order the xxxl so I could fit some heavier layers under the coat. All in all , it's a nice coat that's made well and worth the money spent."
CRYSULLY Men’s Fall Fashion Zipper Up Casual Windbreak Bomber Jacket Coat Army Green,A little thinner than expected but it still quite warm,4,"I bought this for my boyfriend and he likes the look of it a lot but we thought it would be thicker/heavier but it was more on the light/thin side. It does keep him warmer than he expected tho. He's a man of few words and when I asked if he liked it so far (he's had it about two weeks now) he replied ""yeah. It's straight."" Believe it or not that's pretty much a 5 star review coming from him. I have to say he looks good in it. Actually so do I, truth be told. The jacket is not feminine in anyway but a female could definitely wear it."
CRYSULLY Men’s Fall Fashion Zipper Up Casual Windbreak Bomber Jacket Coat Army Green,Warm but runs small,3,The first thing I disliked is the zipper is for left handed people.The size was smaller than sizing info stated.The insulation seems warm and the cuffs are not itchy.
CRYSULLY Men’s Fall Fashion Zipper Up Casual Windbreak Bomber Jacket Coat Army Green,"Quality, Price & Availability for Christmas",5,"Was delivered a little late, suppose to be a Christmas present my son did like the jacket, seemed like great quality, sizing was off a bit, but will order another one.  Product was returned, and refunded in a timely manner by the merchant, and that is greatly appreciated!  We will order a bigger size."
CRYSULLY Men’s Fall Fashion Zipper Up Casual Windbreak Bomber Jacket Coat Army Green,Good But Different,4,"The jacket is pretty close to a proper fit.

CRYSULLY Men’s Fall Fashion Zipper Up Casual Windbreak Bomber Jacket Coat Army Green,Nice Lightweight Jacket,5,The zipper pull is on the wrong side!
CRYSULLY Men’s Fall Fashion Zipper Up Casual Windbreak Bomber Jacket Coat Army Green,Good length for 6ft+,5,"Perfect! Exactly what i wanted. I’m 6ft tall so it can be hard to find a good bomber jacket. Most traditional ones are short and bulky and only get wider as the size goes up (not longer). Other long bombers can sometimes be thin and cheap. This was the perfect bomber for me! The Large fits me perfectly, its just long enough and not super thin. Plus waterproof! Happy customer"

CRYSULLY Men’s Fall Fashion Zipper Up Casual Windbreak Bomber Jacket Coat Army Green,,0,Fits perfect. Medium. I'm 5ft 9 broad shoulders fits me great. Love it just like what we had back in the 80's. I see people complaining it's cold for winter. That's stupid. This was never meant to be a winter jacket it's a summer fall jacket. For the price i can't complain and i prefer the zip on the left as it is as i'm a lefty anyway. Great jacket

Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,Dont waste your money,1,"The material is wack , the material is like plastic"
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,"I am about 5'11 and i believe i'm all most 170lbs and a medium fit me perfect, i love the jacket i love the material",5,"the jacket was a day late, but i expected that, from reading these reviews prior to buying it i was skeptic toward purchasing it because of size complications and the possibility that the material would be uncomfortable or too thin, I am about 5'11 and i believe i'm all most 170lbs and a medium fit me perfect, i love the jacket i love the material, and everybody else around me loves it, it was a great buy and i will be buying more colors..........I hope my review helped.......but side note, its pretty hard to scrape the color off the jacket but if it rubs up against a rough surface with some pressure it will scratch the color off, but believe me you[d really have to be trying to apply pressure to that surface, the zipper is great and the hood is very proportionate for my big head and long hair."
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,JUST BE AWARE,2,"Don’t get me wrong. This is a stylish jacket that’s fits the urban millennial style of 2019. Only problem with this product is that it was way smaller than their other jackets. I bought two of the same jackets just different colors both at LARGE. The green one fits like a large but the navy blue one fits like a medium. Both jackets are made from different material and have different zipper styles. So depending on what color you choose you will get a different material and size from the posted size you selected. Also on my green jacket, the zipper got stuck and won’t open but I can zip it up and put it on but can’t un zip it fully"
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,"Here's what you need to know about ""dark red"" jacket",2,"I agree with several reviews in respect to the length of this jacket: I bought Large size and what I got is by no means that size. It is way too short!Another issue, the color: it is not ""dark red"" that the seller shows in the picture/photo of it.  It's much brighter red.  Not as much as the ""red"" one, but still, not even close to what the seller advertises in the photos of this ""dark red"" jacket.I like the material, it's always matter of taste and personal ""liking"" or not liking.But here's one more thing: wake up and smell the coffee, Homaok: it's year 2020 and we have smart phones we need to carry in our jackets.  Your pockets not only have no zipper or a snap to make sure they don't fall out of these pockets, these pockets are just way too shallow to hold many of smart phones we have.I do not recommend this product."
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,Trash,1,Wretched piece of trash.  First of all the label said XXL I ordered a small (I checked) and it appeared the size of a small.  The material was thinner than bible paper.  The zipper was completely broken.  Returned.
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,KNOW HOW YOU WANT IT TO FIT!!,5,"As a general rule of thumb for any clothing that is manufactured overseas, you need to know how you want it to fit and the size you need based on your area. Mine fit great so I'm not complaining, just a warning. I bought this about 2 years ago and they are great quality compared to some of the other products I've gotten overseas. The material is very thin and not very breathable but if you wear it over a t-shirt it won't stick to your skin and make you sweat. It's very stylish too, would definitely recommend."
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,good price; good jacket *thumbs up*,4,"the quality is pretty nice and incredibly soft. the color is really good and the price for it is really good. dont zip with this jacket it just doesn't work (as a style not the zipper by the way). another thing, don't wear it when it's raining and never mix colors with this jacket. You'll ruin the jacket if you mix and colors (trust me I have). The color is really white and well done so if you mix it with any by accident or whatsoever it'll ruin it.tldr; good jacket go get it."
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,"Great quality, nice fit",5,"I bought this jacket for my 15 yr old son, who was looking for Techwear type clothing. The jacket fit him great, he is about 5'8 190 lbs and we got him an XL and it fits him really good and the length is very nice as well. He said it fits great in the arms and chest area and doesn't feel too tight. The jacket is also great quality and looks exactly like the picture. We are very pleased with our purchase and would definitely recommend to others."
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,Fits Great.,5,"FIRST IMPRESSIONS [will be updated after a while]:The jacket fits nicely, I am 5'11, 189lbs, work out, average build. I ordered a large although I wear a medium shirt, so I advise stepping up from your shirt size. The material is nice and light, seems like it will be good for fall. After the first wash I will update to see if any of the words or logos fell off."
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,"on the small side, XL is big L.",2,"thin, cheaply made, extraordinarily small pockets. Probably will return. On the plus side looks stylish and has working hood."
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,Awesome style!,3,"I really like the style of this jacket. I have actually bought 3 different styles of it in different sizes to accommodate for layering.

Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,One Star,1,"Ridiculously small, awful material."
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,Think wizard of oz for sizes.,1,The size is way off I got the 4X and arms come up closer to the elbow than the wrist. I can’t even close the jacket let alone zipper it. I ended up giving it to a coworker for her middle school son. Which it did fit. Maybe when it says Men’s jacket they really mean boys.

Don’t waste your money unless you are a small statured person."

Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,Cheaply made don't waste your time!!!,1,To sum it up quickly I was expecting a light hoodie with a bit different material than what I received.

It ended up being worse than what I imagined the seams of the pockets were undone, there was a ""bruise"" to the fabric, and there were too many loose and undone threads all over the jacket to know that it was cheaply made and that it wouldn't last a week of light wearing.

"Columbia Men's Utilizer Jacket, Collegiate Navy 2",Nice Quality Jacket,5,It wasn’t easy finding a “windbreaker” type jacket with some light (flannel type) lining instead of mesh lining or no lining at all so I was pleased to find this one and even happier once I received it and saw the nice quality.
"Columbia Men's Utilizer Jacket, Collegiate Navy 2",Very useful in cool S. Calif weather,5,"This jacket is just about perfect for the cooler S. Cal weather when in 50's-60's, and very comfortable. Zipper needed a little lubrication but zips all the way up to cover neck area. Lining is very comfortable fleece type and sleeves conveniently have velco closures which helps a lot. I ordered it in a slightly larger size (extra large) for more space under shirts, etc and works well. Another great Columbia product for a fair price."

"Columbia Men's Utilizer Jacket, Collegiate Navy 2",,0,Im a larger guy and have the problem where I fit in large and xl but sometimes xl is to big and l is to small. Well in this case the L was a smaller large. So if you have a similar body to me this is the maller sized large and xl so I would but an XL.
"Columbia Men's Utilizer Jacket, Collegiate Navy 2",,0,"This jacket I sent great . I have an XL and it it perfect length .... goes To my hips and not my knees !! Only thing that is a little too big are the cuffs around where your hands are exposed at the wrist. Besides that I feel perfectly happy with my purchase ... And seems to be good quality as I have had this jacket for a few months and wear it daily - all day on and off at work, and standing up to the rest 👍"
"Columbia Men's Utilizer Jacket, Collegiate Navy 2",,0,"This jacket fits as expected, is warm, cuts the wind & is water resistant. Only complaint is the chest pocket.

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Perfect base layer,5,Exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for a water resistant light weight and warm base layer. This one fits great. 2 deep internal pockets. Zippers on external pockets. Well constructed. No issues so far. I plan to scotch guard it just to ensure its water resistant.Ordered Size Large.5ft 6200lbs
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Nice fit but still have to try out,4,"For the price I had to try.  I have an REI version of this jacket.  This version is a little bit more tough and rough it seems.  I was able to pack it in the bag it came along with.  I'm 150lb 5'6 and got a Small.  As you can see in the pictures it fits fine, the chest portion is a little snug as I wear a 38 jacket.  The waist portion has a lot of room left.  Two pockets on the outside and two on the inside.  I still have to try out during a colder night, but I think it'll get the job done!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Versatile light-mid weight jacket - perfect for multi-uses,5,"It's impossible to find anything I don't like about this jacket.  I'm completely surprised - especially because of the low cost.  I was not expecting this level of quality, look and feel.  I wanted a light weight jacket that could be layer under and especially for travel where space and weight is a concern and I didn't want to pay a lot of money for it.  I looked at a LOT of jackets and they were either too warm, too bulky or too cheaply made based on reviews.  And then I found this incredible jacket.It exceeded my expectations in all categories.  I would say the temp range is from 20-45 degrees with fairly minimal layering/under garments, but that will depend on just what you wear underneath.  It definitely does a nice job of breaking the wind, so with fleece underneath, it could be toasty at 15 degrees.  It's extremely comfortable - it barely feels like you are wearing a jacket at all.  I'm 6'1"" with a 42"" chest, 180 lbs, and a large fits perfectly with sufficient space for movement and a layer or two.  The length is perfect at just below the waist and the sleeve length perfect - I wear a 36"" sleeve.  As others have mentioned the collar does not turn down, but it is a pretty minimal collar and with this soft material, I find I really like the collar the way it is.  The material is soft and pliable and never feels stiff and uncomfortable.  I bought the Heather Green and it's really a nice color that has a great casual look and it's not that shiny look - it's kinda matte type finish.  I've gotten a lot of complements on it.  And when I tell people what I paid they are blown away.The jacket has two large lined and very deep exterior side pockets that zip and one large interior vest pocket that does not zip or close which is fine by me.  Velcro would have been annoying.  And finally, it comes with a separate bag with a draw string that secures the jacket when rolled up.  And the bag can attach to the inside coat hanger loop if you desire, which is how it came and the way I use it.  The water resistant feature is nice for drizzle and mist, but I'll wear it underneath a waterproof windbreaker in rainy conditions.  This will become my go to travel jacket.This is indeed a home run for Amazon Basics and I highly recommend this jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Solid jacket. On par with name brands for significantly less.,5,"Live in Georgia, so don’t need a blizzard proof jacket. Tested this jacket in the low 40’s in windy and rainy weather with just a long sleeve running shirt underneath. Toasty warm. Compares very favorably with a TNF Thermoball jacket I have, and I actually think this Amazon jacket is warmer. Seems to be solid construction. Can’t go wrong for $39."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,This Jacket is perfect,5,"I bought this jacket for my son last minute for a trip out of state.  I needed something fast as it was going to be very cold and all he had was a windbreaker/shell and sweatshirts.  Jacket came quickly and was perfect.  I ordered a large, he is 6'3, thin build and it fit him in the sleeves and body.  The length was great too.  The length was most likely such a good fit for his height due to him being very slender.  So if you are shorter but thicker the large would probably fit.  He wore the jacket the whole time over a sweatshirt and it kept him warm.  It is a basic no frills very plain jacket.  Just what he likes, no labels, bells or whistles.  At this price point you can not go wrong.  I ordered the black and it looked much like my Patagonia jacket.  Amazon basics does it again for me!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,it actually fits,5,"I stand 6'2"" weigh 200 pounds.  with 35 inch arms I have to wear xxl for the sleeves.  this fits perfectly, you will probably not wear this in Chicago on state street in February but if you live in san Francisco you will probably wear it year round.  as with amazon basic it's well made."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Loving It So Far, We'll See In A Month Or So",5,"I ordered this jacket more than a year ago, & so far it's been the best $40 I've ever spent on any single article of clothing. My friends have all been blown away by the light weight, & here in the San Francisco Bay Area it's all the jacket I need. The medium size fits me perfectly ( 5'10"", 180 pounds) & layers perfectly over a hoody if I need extra warmth. My only complaint, & it's a very tiny one, is that I wish one of the inside pockets were a little smaller. But, sized as they are, I can fit my pocket umbrella into one & my beanie cap into the other. When packed into its stuff sack it fits nicely into my backpack & I can leave it there for long periods, pull it back out, & it's ready to wear. I wear it all the time, there's been no sign of defects, & I love this jacket so much I'm likely going to order another in a different color. If your area's winters are really cold you'll likely want a heavier jacket, but if you live on the California coast you probably don't need anything heavier than this. Highly recommended, especially at this price!!!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Reliable Casual Jacket,4,"It's lightweight, seems well constructed and is reliable. I've worn it in temperatures as low as 13 degrees fahrenheit and it kept me warm. It's not one of those high-end down puffer jackets, but if you're looking for a lightweight jacket for being out and about in cold weather, this is solid. I've also heard of people stowing this jacket in its pack in their cars for emergencies, which is a great idea too."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Good jacket for the money,4,"Looks good and is breathable, but will still keep you warm. They must have fitted this for a square person with a big belly though. The bottom flares out for anyone with a beer belly lol. On a lighter note, it is still a good product and my favorite thing about this jacket is how comfortable it is. 4 stars. Btw I am 6’3 at 205 and athletic and I bought the XL. A large would probably fit my body better overall but probably be too short and ride up at my waistUpdate:I ordered the large to see if it fit better and it was in fact too small in the shoulders and only went down to my belt buckle. Dang, right in between sizes. Oh well, I’m returning the large and keeping the XL. There is such a difference between the two sizes that I think my XL may just have been improperly measured when made and that’s why the belly sticks out; or maybe they just figured anyone bigger than a size large probably has a beer belly and accommodated lol. Still 4 stars for the price and comfort. I think the only reason I’m making a big deal about it is because my girlfriend gave me a hard time about my apparent beer belly and I’m hung up on it. Anyhoo, plenty of room to grow so pass me a Guinness ;)"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Size matters!,5,"First off, let me say that my whole family wears either Patagonia, North Face, or Columbia. Good stuff!....but I just can’t bring myself to spend $150+ dollars on a sweater or light jacket. If I was exploring Alaska or Northern Europe, then I would feel differently, but I’m not so I try and keep the expenses under control.I purchased this jacket on a whim and I’m quite happy with it. It’s light but surprisingly warm and with my rain jacket over it, I’ve never had even a chill. It comes with a little bag so it must scrunch up quite small although I’ve yet to attempt it. And a word about sizing. I usually buy a large, but after reading a number of reviews here, I decided to take their advice and go one size down. To all of you who suggested that, a big thank you. It fits perfect!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Exceeded my expectations... for two weeks,1,Absolutely perfect. Can’t do better for the money. Thanks!Update... less than 30 days later and the stuffing is already coming out of it. Guess you get what you pay for. I’m on the road for work and forgot to start the return before the 30 day limit (jacket failed after 2 weeks) and now I’m stuck with it. Never again amazon essentials
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Has most of what I really want,5,"Would like it to be a bit warmer, I really need to wear another jacket underneath to get the warmth I would like. I also would like to have the ability to stuff the jacket into itself. However, I really like the inside pockets opposite the outside hand warming pockets. For me this gives me a safe place to put things that I feel comfortable will not fall out, and I find this a lot more comfortable than a chest pocket. It also fits a lot of stuff and bulky stuff if you need to. In fact it is a big reason I bought this jacket (plus price). Wish all jackets had these pockets and I am obviously not the only one that likes this feature because so many jackets now have these pockets. However, having a pocket stuff to stuff the jacket into would also be great. Lost the first jacket, and bought exactly the same jacket to replace it which shows what I think of this product."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great fit and perfect for a winter in the South,5,"Got this for my dad in and XL for Christmas. He is approx 5’8” and 215lbs and the fit is great. I got this for him after getting the women’s version for myself and love it. Was really happy to see they had a men’s version as well. Similar to the women’s version, the men’s is lightweight but warm enough for a winter in the south and cut so that it’s comfortable to wear a light weight sweater under it with no problem. We haven’t tested it in sub freezing conditions yet, but we only get that cold a few times a year.All in all I have been very impressed with these amazon jackets and will continue to give them as gifts and get them for the whole family!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Mom and preteen approved,5,My nearly 12 year old son needed a warm coat to wear when he walks to middle school 6 blocks away.  He also needed to be able to store it in his backpack when it's nice and warm on the way home. This  coat worked perfectly for that purpose.  He is 5ft 2 and ways 110 lbs and the xs looks great and fits well even when he chooses to put his hoodie on underneath.  He doesnt have the patience to store in the bag that comes with it but it jams down in the bottom of his backpack nicely.  This is the perfect in between. Need more than a hoodie but not a sledding parka.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Good quality & price, disappointing fit.",3,"Decent quality jacket that seems to be well made and more premium than the price would suggest.  My main issue is that the photo is a little misleading and shows the jacket to be a trimmer fit around the waist/midsection. It’s actually quite baggy and looks like I’m overweight. (I’m 5’10, 150lb and quite athletic - ordered the medium)"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,GREAT JACKET,5,"My husband owns a Uniqlo jacket and its warm, packable and stylish. I was in a rush (we were headed to San Francisco in 2 days) and needed something similar to that jacket for my son. I found it on Amazon!! This jacket is water resistant - we know bc it rained during most of our trip. It’s warm without being heavy and bulky. And it’s stylish and looked wonderful on my very opinionated 12 year old. Very happy with this purchase."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Amazing Lightweight jacket,5,"Lightweight and keeps me warm. Looks good on me, but that’s not saying a lot, I’m very handsome and everything looks good on me."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Perfect,5,"I purchased four or five other jackets, some on Amazon and some from a department store and didn’t like any of them... but I finally landed on one that I love.  Great fit feels quality and I like the color a lot.  I am about 6.1 and weigh about 195.  I like my clothes to fit somewhat fitted and I got this in a medium and it’s perfect."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great jacket for way cheaper than other brands.,5,"A great jacket for the price, especially when compared to other brands which are well over $100.00. Very lightweight yet warm and fits perfectly. I get a lot of compliments on it and people are always surprised when I tell them how cheap it was. Definitely recommended as a great spring or fall type jacket. It gets below freezing here in the winter so I grab my heavy winter coat still on the cold days but this is the best for those in between days where the heavy coat is too hot but just a shirt is not enough."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,It works!!!,5,It’s a basic style that actually works well in a 40F weather - but remember you have to add layer(s).I used this on a light drizzle and felt like the jacket absorbed some moisture but quickly dried once I hanged it.  It’s great it can be rolled into a tiny pouch and totally this jacket is comparable with those branded ones.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Probably one of the best pieces of clothing/outerwear I have bought from Amazon!,5,"I was pleasantly surprised by what I received in the form of this puffer jacket. I have never bought anything from Amazon Essentials but I have heard good things about them so I thought I'd roll the dice on this puffer jacket. I live in Wisconsin so it gets pretty cold here. My plan was to use this as a light jacket on warmer days and as a base layer on colder days.When I got it it was well packaged. When I opened it I was impressed with the fabric as it was thicker than my LL Bean $150 down vest. The jacket is well constructed and has extra stitching on the inside pockets to reinforce the fabric. All zippers are YKK zippers and well sewn in. The insulation is not down but synthetic fiber. One thing I have found out about synthetic down/fiber is just as warm as natural down. I wore the jacket during a recent cold snap (-2 below F) over a t-shirt and light vest and found it remarkably warm.I got the size large and I am a ""towering"" 5'3"" and 175lbs. The sleeves are slightly long but with the elastic on the sleeves it's doable. The bottom of the jacket, as expected is a bit long but none too bad. Enough to cover my butt so I am fine with that.So in conclusion, if you are thinking about getting this jacket, do it. It punches above it's weight, you get a lot of value for the money."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Much warmer than I expected,5,"I wore this outside in Minneapolis today, with a wind chill hovering around -10 F for up to 15 minutes at a time and was quite comfortable under it. I was wearing a sweater under it. It fits well, the inside pockets are super big, and I love the zipper pockets on the front. It packs up small and is lightweight.I give it 5 stars, but have it had it less than a a month so can’t speak to long-term durability. I bought it to serve me in between fall and real winter but now I’m thinking that it could be my main winter coat for all but the coldest days, and even then since I will only be outside for a few moments. I am pleasantly surprised."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Improper Sizing,1,"I normally wear a size XL, but I ordered size XXL figuring that I could wear a heavy sweater under the jacket during the winter, and that I do not like clothing that fits tightly on my body. Unfortunately the manufacturer does NOT understand sizing. What they have marked as XXL is, at best a large. BUYER BEWARE!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great Down Alternative!,4,"I bought 2 of these jackets. 1 for my husband and 1 for me (I prefer men's, they are more concerned with function than looking cute- I'm concerned with being warm). I bought it when my husband's Cabela down finally ripped& he was tired of looking like a bird losing its feathers. I was skeptical that non down would be warm enough, but it is. I'm in a very mild climate, but nights can get very chilly. I doubt this jacket works well in less than 40 degrees F and you're only wearing a t shirt underneath. But for higher, very toasty. Esp if you're layered underneath. My only ""complaint""(¬ really, lol) is the color was off- I wanted a baby blue color like the picture. It was more slate, dull blue. My husband loved the olive green, like his old Cabela. The inside pockets are wide and deep. The outside pockets are zippered. The collar is high and blocks wind. I bought large for us both, he's 5'11 190lbs. It fit perfect. I'm 5'2 155;) it was exactly what I wanted. Large enough for sweaters &covers me completely. And it crushes well with a small packing pouch. Very happy with this jacket!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,I could not recommend more than for the pack rat who loves storage space.,5,"I have 3 things to tell you 1 how functional the jacket is, 2. The amazing use I got out of the jacket as a pack rat, 3. A story involving me, this jacket and a day trying to explore the Cape Cod in the cold.1. This jacket provided me with amazing warmth from 35f as a Floridan who has never seen snow and you'd expect to freeze over this jacket provided me amazing warmth from the cold climate and ocean breeze in the cold of winter.2. As a photographer it is sometimes cumbersome to carry all my equipment I need, but not only that often having it all in my camera bags makes it hard to switch to a needed accessory, or lens at a moments notice often making me not switch up my stuff while taking photos often, however this jacket has provided me with more pockets, zippers, compartments, ect than I could of ever dreamed of, one inner pocket for important items like a camera lens, cleaner, cap, ect the other inner pocket for a portable charger and with the help of long cords you can power any device around you, a little drawstring pouch for wallet,keys, ect, things you cant afford to lose and it tucks away on the inside of the jacket, then outter pockets beside to keep your hands warm, deep one being able to hold your phone your hand and so much more the other easy for keeping gloves and a beanie or other items that you may want to take on or off throughout your day. With the outer pockets with zippers so you can secure your things but even unzipped with how deep the pockets are good luck with anything falling out which leads me to my number 3.3. I throughout the day talking pictures and videos I fell on multiple occasions, 4 times to be exact, each one comedically getting funnier and more out of place, busting my butt, knees side anything to prevent me from falling on my camera gear, and often with normal jackets things may fall out of your pockets but for this jacket and every fall not once did I lose anything or have to worry about anything falling out. cementing in the fact I had to leave a review telling you the people how much I love this jacket.The one and only downside is that there is no hood to this jacket, hopefully amazon will make a new and improved version with a hood, for the mean time I just double layered a hooded shirt and kept a beanie with me which will work as well"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Keeps me dry and warm at -30°F.,5,"I bought this jacket in an XL based off some reviews saying the sizes run small. Im 5'5"" and weigh 190lbs and generally wewr size L. I conceal carry so I wanted to ensure this jacket wasnt to tight to avoid printing, and im glad I did. The XL fits perfectly with just enough space to carry without snagging my gun or printing. Also, this jacket keeps me toasty warm here in Alaska (current temps are averaging -30°F - 0°F and windy). I have contemplated gettjng a second to go with my hunting gear as the jacket can pack down to about the size of a standard Jetboil. Definitely recommend buying this if youre looking for a low cast, good quality puffy coat."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Larger than anticipated, buy smaller size",4,"I purchased a Large, and found it to fit more like an XL. Having since replaced it with a Medium, it fits much better. It's warm, and very light. Although I would say you need layers underneath to stay warm in cold weather. The quality is good, and looks fashionable. Overall it was a good purchase."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"""Sale"" price or not?",3,"I purchased a light-green jacket in my size on the day Amazon was doing a sale. The jacket arrived but it was more of a camaflauge color, not a solid light-green at all which is what the photo showed. Okay, no big deal, their photo is misleading, but I'll just return it and get the same jacket in the same size but this time in another color, navy blue. For the replacement jacket (in navy blue), I was charged the full non-sale price. Does that seem right? A store would not have done that. An actual store would have made the exchange and not charged me more, especially since it was their photo that was misleading.  So while the jacket is just fine, and it fits nice, every time I put it on I'm a bit miffed at Amazon for essentially jacking up the price due to their own mistake."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Perfect hiking jacket.,5,This was perfect for our hiking adventure. We hike quite often in Montana and have realized no matter the time of year it becomes cold at night. We fell asleep to 60 degrees and perfect and woke uo to 10 degrees and 5 inches of snow. I had on a couple layers but this jacket was the perfect addition. Not only does it pack down enough to be carried in easily its warm enough to be an essential addition to my hiking gear.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great Jacket!,5,"Wanted a new puffy jacket for hiking & backpacking & other outdoor activities, but did not want to invest a great amount of money into it.  Needed to be comfortable and fit nicely over a fleece if cold and under my rain jacket if wet.  I also wanted it to be packable so I could save space in my backpack/daypack should I need to shed a layer.This jacket met all of those criteria!Very comfortable.  Just my size (I have tried a few other brands on and a medium was either too tight or way too big, and moving up/down a size did not really help me) - I am 5'7""  / 165 lbs.  I really appreciate the 2 inner pockets, which are a great size for headlamps, gloves, a flask, or lots of other similarly sized items one takes outdoors.  Sleeves fit nicely over gloves to keep it mostly 'sealed' but also breathable.Very warm.  Was out at a scout camp in 17*F weather and had this over a long sleeve T shirt and a scout shirt.  Was plenty warm on my body with minimal movement at times, but not overheating.  Easy to move in.  Really enjoyed the outing because of the comfort.My son asked for one of these, so I may purchase another.  Recommend this jacket!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,You get what you pay for - as I expected.,3,"Decent jacket for the price.  Mine is an XL in camel color or khaki, so I only paid $29.99 + tax.  It does all stuff into one of the zippered pockets and the total weight without the stuff sack - which I received - is 14.3 onces.  So not extremely light, but not bad.  The stuffed size is about 10x3x1.5 inches and it smooshes down a little more.  I am 5ft 9ins, 205lbs with a big belly and it fits me very well.  The material is regular nylon, very light and thin - I would not where as an outer garment in heavy brush or thorns.  The stuff material is synthetic stuff like you find in cheap furniture.  A good insulator but not great.  As a part of a good layering system I am sure it will work well for me in Arizona."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Decent build quality for price; Horrible fit,3,"The lightweight packable jacket is decently built for the price. The material (Heather Gray) is really ugly and looks cheap. It doesnt look like the pictures. But, thats a matter of personal preference.The problem for me (and, anyone who is of normal build, I imagine), is the fit.The arms, shoulders and chest fit more or less normal, but the torso from the chest down is like you are wearing your big brother's clothes. I am 5'-10"", 160 lbs, athletically built, and this thing looks clownishly ridiculous on me.  Its so baggy - and by default, drafty, that it doesnt even do a good job of keeping you warm on bottom half.Obviously cut for overweight people. Its got what I call the typical 'American Fat $%&#' cut.If this sounds like a fit that might work for you, then you are in luck.For me, return."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Good quality, warm, but fit kinda wired.",3,"I bought this coat based off of reviews. It sounded like a good option and was considering the great quality for the price. But when I got it and put it on, it fit great in the arms, chest, and shoulders/neck, but it was huge from my arm pits to my waist. It kinda ballooned outward as it went towards my waistline. I hade 4 inches of give around my waist. Not true to size if you usually wear a medium. Wierd fit for sure. But like I said good quality and it felt warm. Just wish it fit properly lol"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,It’s not the jacket’s fault. It’s Amazon’s.,4,"3/20 Most recent update. The jackets were corrected after the old mishaps and they are holding strong after over a year of use. Still comfortable and super fast drying. Great simple buy for the avid outdoor adventurer or someone that wants a simple, cheap,comfortable, and  decent looking jacket.Older review;It’s a decent product for the cost. The stitching on the inside collar is misaligned and frayed a little, but the one I bought for my girlfriend looks perfect. I just hope it doesn’t come unravel over time.The reason for the 2 stars is because I returned one jacket because it was the wrong size from what I ordered. The second one that I repurchased is the wrong color. Im just upset that Amazon couldn’t get it right the first or second time and it prevented me from using it for a while."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Good at first, didn't hold up to use.",3,"Honestly I have mixed feelings. It's very packable, warm enough for above freezing temps, and served it's purpose for me... But after a single winter it's showing significant wear. A few punctures and seams are giving me pause. I think I will prefer something with a ripstop nylon in the future.If you are really gentile with your clothing this is probably fine. If you are the outdoors type and expects something that can deal with harsher conditions, maybe look elsewhere. Fit and finish were fine at first. As expected.I'm sad that I will have to sew it up a bit after only one season and retire it as a packed spare jacket for future seasons."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Good jacket for the $40.00 price.,5,Waist is an inch or two too long at 5’ 11”. When you sit in a chair without lifting it out from under your sit bones it wants to choke you. Sleeves are perfect length. Collar absolutely will not stay folded down so expect it to always be touching the back of your neck. A cinch style waist chord would help this jacket a lot.If it’s above 45F and you’re wearing a long sleeved base and pants then totally expect to be carrying it more than wearing it while actually hiking. That first hour of hiking at 45F and I was very comfortable. If used as a liner under a light jacket or rain jacket I could hike in temps as low as 12F with no problems. It doesn’t breathe well but it does breathe some so check the small of your back every once in awhile for sweat build up and adjust accordingly.As an avid day hiker I’ll only need to replace it when it’s getting worn out. If actual through hiking in winter then I would definitely opt for a higher R rating for night and the early morning hours.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Excellent value,5,"I like this jacket very much. The fit is good for me and I like the look. It is lightweight and warm in weather down to around 50° (with t-shirt and sweater). It’s got two oversized interior pockets and a pair of zip-up outer pockets. As a musician I enjoy wearing it indoors on cold mornings during practice, it’s so lightweight and flexible that it doesn’t restrict movement.It seems to be as well constructed as more expensive alternatives (they’re all made in China or Vietnam anyway). The fact that it’s not so expensive means that I don’t need to worry about damaging or spilling things on it like I would had I spent a lot more $$$ for a brand name."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Light, warm, and a great fit!",5,"I love this jacket! I’m 6’2”, weigh around 205, and I ordered the XL. It fits great. I was looking for something light but warm that I could wear with layers when piloting my general aviation aircraft. This is perfect. There is plenty of room and it’s light weight enough to not be restrictive. I can also pack it away in my flight bag if necessary. I looked at several similar big brand jackets that cost twice as much. I think this is a great value."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Really Strange Cut/Fit and Color,2,"I am 6' and 160 lbs and generally always wear medium shirts and jackets.  This jacket in medium fits fine in the shoulders and chest, but it keeps getting wider toward the waist.  It's hard for clothes to make a skinny guy like me look fat, but that's exactly what this jacket does.  It's a solid 6-8 inches too wide in the stomach and waist area.Also, the pictures seem to indicate that the grey color is uniform, but it definitely is not.  It's got a distinct salt and pepper sort of pattern.It's a real shame the fit is so weird because the jacket otherwise feels reasonably high-quality for the price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Warm and fits properly for an XL,5,Initially bought an XXL (that I since gifted to a friend) because some reviews suggested they were undersized. Not the case for XL and XXL.  XL fits as XL should. Great warmth from a polyester filled puffy coat. Packs down very small to go in my pack and offers good warmth. Definitely need good base layers for this to be a below freezing coat but if layered properly it works amazingly. I use an Acme waterproof rain coat over it to make this a 4 season/any weather coat. Enough room for base layers under and can still fit my rain shell over it to keep warm and dry.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great every day jacket.,5,"My husband was looking for a moderate jacket to wear to replace his old every day jacket. We live in the southeast, so our winters aren’t snow filled, but they are a bone-chilling cold here and there. He LOvES this jacket. It fits perfectly, the polyester type material wipes off easily-he works outside a good bit and has to have clothing that can handle a lot of dirt/mud and abuse. This very affordable option works perfectly. It is warm and perfect for southeast winters without layering. It does not have any venting and even though he does a good bit of outdoor manual labor, it has weathered nicely. It is easily packable and well designed for active use. The affordability was our main draw and the quality is worth much more than the price reflects."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great Jacket for Pretty Cheap,5,"Just got this jacket. Price point is really good compared to branded alternatives. There are a bunch that are almost double this price and though it depends on the color you’re looking for and size, I think this is a steal for just over $30.The fit is what I expected (got the large size). The sleeves are surprisingly perfect length which is generally an issue for me where they tend to be too long. The elastic band at the cuffs is what really does the trick and there isn’t a crazy amount of material bunched up which is great.The jacket looks like it is made well with no stray threads sticking out and the seams look good to me (at least for now but time is the real test here).  There are 2 zippered pockets on the sides and matching inner pockets that drop down hidden in the lining. The zippers themselves look fine to me and neither pockets nor main zipper have gotten stuck yet (no tugging on the fabric to clear the track yet).I would definitely recommend this, especially if you’re looking for something to wear casually or on your commute or even stuff in the packable bag and throw in your car for a time you find yourself in need of a jacket. Can’t stress it enough, well worth it at this price and I really like the dark blue color.The only real negative I have is that there is no clear instructions for packing it in the pouch but that’s easy enough to stuff. About the pouch though, it is not really attached to the jacket so once you undo the loop, try not to lose it if you’re going to be using it a lot."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Perfect for Ireland,5,"A low-profile/lightweight ""puff"" puffy jacket perfect for cool, but not cold, weather travelling. Size L fit perfectly for 42R frame, including room for a shirt & sweater layer underneath. My husband wore this in Ireland earlier this summer, with lows in the 40s and high near 58 most days. I expect this will get lots of use in our future northern European and Alaska cruise travels. The grey fabric is smooth, slightly shiny, and has a heather look, not a flat solid color.  Zip slash pockets on outside, one unzipped patch pocket inside, suitable for safekeeping eyeglass case or wallet."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Patterned Green, Good Value",4,"A little disappointed to see this is not a solid green but patterned.  It’s not bad, but not what I had hoped or expected.  However, I did receive a compliment the first week of wearing it.  Inside pockets are a nice touch and the zipper works perfectly.  Quality of materials and stitching are also good.Fit is a little tight at the shoulders, but not restrictive.  Also the cuffs don’t allow for my watch to pass through on its own.  These fitment “issues“ may just be by design to maximize warmth.  This does a good job against wind and keeps me warm down to the 40s no problem, especially when paired with a knit cap and scarf.  Haven’t yet tried it in colder temperatures or for longer than 30 minutes.  Would consider heavy-duty jackets for sub-30 degree temps.  For 40-60F days, this does the trick just fine.Also, I opened a packet of salsa that splattered on the jacket and it wiped up no problem, showing no signs of penetration or staining.For the price (around $45), I would buy again and would recommend."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"A basic, packable, warm value",5,"Though I'm a little lanky for it, my size Medium AE down puffer jacket rules. It feels sturdy, has good zippers for the front pull and the zippered pockets, and very nice seams and cuffs. I consider it a direct rival that's possibly superior to the entry-level Eddie Bauer CirrusLite down jacket, and better than the 600-weight offering from Land's End. (which fits me better as it's a Medium Tall, but has single-snap outsize pockets. Useless.) If you want a packable, water-resistent basic down jacket, this Amazon Essentials one is tough to beat."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Toasty after half of a 1.4 mi walk in 28 F morning air,5,"I tried this jacket this morning: I need something to keep me warm fly fishing this winter. I tried layering beneath an insulated vest on a windy (40 mph) day at 38 F but my arms weren't warm. This puffy jacket zips up to form a collar seal at my neck, the sleeves are long enough for my 76"" arm span, and I finished my walk with it unzipped half way. It packs into a 6"" diameter, 8"" long nylon bag (included). It's passed my test(s) so far. I didn't test its water repellency or whether it can withstand things like Hawthorne or Russian Olive thorns.."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,I am pleased with this product.,5,"I am really quite happy with both the quality and fit of this jacket. It is light enough to wear both as a jacket and as a layer under a bigger jacket if you want to use it that way as well. My body is a bit like Homer Simpson at the moment so though the jacket fits, its a little tighter across the tummy, so if you have this kind of body build take it into account when ordering. I really like the storage bag as well, it will come in handy for storing it over the summer months by keeping it clean and dust free."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great Jacket,5,"Great jacket, the design, color, fit and feel of it is excellent. It has two outer pockets with zippers, and two inner pockets. The feel of the material is very soft. Decent insulation which fills out more after taking the jacket out of the packaging and letting it fluff/ wearing it. The color of the material is great, grey is a medium grey drab color and seems to change slightly in different lighting, it is not shiny which is good. If you want more of a fitted jacket, order the exact size based on the measurements you need. If you want it baggy, order one size up. I'm 5' 10"" with a slim build and the small fits perfect and is exactly what I was looking for. High Quality, Highly Recommend"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Nice Jacket, Hope it Holds Up",4,"Have only worn this jacket a few times since getting it.  It's light and warm without the bulk.  From that standpoint, it's very nice. However, the second time I put it on and the first time I zipped it up, the zipper came undone from underneath.  That has me questioning the overall quality and how long this jacket will last.  Time will tell whether the quality is there.  I'll update this review after the winter season."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Superb lightweight jacket,5,"I spray painted mine with a light coat of rustoleum, gave it a powdered look. Exactly what I hoped for. It’s warm and worth the money. If you’re looking for something for sedentary days in the snow or below 40 degrees with wind, get something thicker or wear a sweater/couple layers underneath."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"As good as ""Name Brand""",5,"I have four ""puffer"" jackets and love them all . With this particular jacket , I wore it all winter mostly over a sweatshirt and found it to be warm and comfortable enough to wear down to about 10-15 degrees before having to put on a little heavier down. I love these ""packable"" puffer jackets because they are warm yet very light in weight. They actually make the winter here in Vermont much more bearable because I don't have to put on a heavy weight coat to stay warm outside. Another positive is that this jacket is that it does not wet through and can be washed and dried at home . When drying just throw in a couple tennis balls with it and it will make the jacket puffy as it should be. I rate this jacket as good as any ""name brand"" that I have."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great looking jacket!,3,"Great looking jacket! My only issue is, I ordered the ""MEDIUM BLUE"" color, which resembles, ""SKY BLUE"" or ""BABY BLUE"", based on the images Amazon uses to advertise this jacket, on the internet! However, the, ""MEDIUM BLUE"" color, looks ""MORE"", like the ""BLUE"", color version of this jacket, you're selling instead! ..... The jacket did arrive, ""2"", days earlier than it's original due date, after ""THANKSGIVING"", it fits well (IT'S ROOMY), it's light weight and it feels very warm, when I put it on! In addition to that, based on the price, I probably will purchase other, additional colors in the future (PERHAPS) ..... I brought my size, an XX-Large! ""BUT"", the color I ordered is actually ""DARKER"", than the color, I thought I was purchasing and because of that, I can only rate this item with, ""3"", stars! 'Cause, I don't know if I was misled or duped into buying a jacket with a color, I don't need or want, ""INTENTIONALLY"", or if there was some kind of foul up at Amazon's processing center! All I know is, I do not have the time to go through the hassle of figuring that out or returning the jacket because I could use it, right now!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Excellent price for Puffer Jacket, good fit",5,Amazon Essentials are hit and miss.  Sometimes great products at excellent price point while other times not so much.  Happy to say this puffer jacket is excellent!  I am 5'7 165 lbs with a small belly.  Pants are always 36W.  Ordered jacket in medium and fit is right on.  There is room for probably a thin long sleeve sweat shirt and no more.  Armpit doesn't have a lot of wiggle room for heavy sweaters.  Not binding and thin enough to wear as a mid layer under a heavier jacket.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Excellent value, great quality, comfy, lightweight",5,"I’m 5’9” 145lbs measuring 40 chest and 29 waist. Small fits me just right. The coat is high quality (great value considering the price), lightweight, wind resistant, warm and takes a surprisingly small amount of space when packed away. It’s the perfect weight/insulation for a winter in the Midwest. If you live up North and are looking for a coat to keep you warm when the weather hits the teens or below, I’d look for a heavier coat."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Impressed relative the cost,4,"Pros: Much warmer and wind resistant than expected. Lightweight and not overly puffy. Very packable. True to size IMO.Cons: Doesn't fit me as well in the shoulders. As longs as my arms are down, it's perfect. Very tight in the shoulder if I try to raise my arms up. When fully zipped I find the top of collar at zipper end can be somewhat uncomfortable on the front of the neck.Comment: I'm 5'11"" 190lbs semi-athletic build. Size Large fits just as well as all of my other size Large jackets do lengthwise in the sleeves and down past the waist.Opinion: For $39 at the time of purchase I'm happy with this jacket. Giving it 4 out of 5 stars because I LIKE it, can't say I love it."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,this is the worst jacket ive ever used,1,"i sure did like the price. and it is not gaudy looking -- for once. but why is there is no cinch cord around the waist? why is it tight in the shoulders? i bought the hooded version as well. was this designed for humans? who designed that hood? or the collar on the jacket? it jabs into your neck, whether zipped all the way up or open!  and why is there no zipper garage, as the zipper catches on one's beard and skin??  this jacket was so bad i put BOTH in the garbage."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Travel packing ready jacket-Looks fresh when removed from the included bag.,5,"This puffer jacket is a real problem solver during colder months where suitcase real estate just won’t accommodate a warm jacket. It’s also very light. The entire garment stuffs into an impossibly small ripstop nylon bag which is included. You’ll find it tied to the interior. With a little practice, you can leave the bag tied to the garment and repack quickly. I was very comfortable in moderately cold weather meaning 40-50-ish, threatening rain. For the price, you'll be able to sport your favorite colors in style."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,nice value and good construction,5,Being from Florida I only own one sweater and no jacket but had to attend a wedding in Nashville in middle of a cold wave. I researched and wanted a lightweight but warm jacket that can be compressed into a  small pouch for my backpack. This jacket worked great and I got a lot of compliments. Even from the fellow next to me wearing a Canada Goose Langford piece. We talked and he was lamenting paying $ 900.00 more than my $ 39.00 price and looking just as good. And I don't have to worry about tiny duck down pushing out from the seams like he does. But the secret is to wear layers with this jacket. You won't be displeased.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Good Sleeve Length,5,"This jacket is a true 2XL in the sense it fits a big guy.  The sleeves are a good enough length. I wear a 35 inch sleeve and this coat hangs well on me but, like every other parka liner or coat I have ever had, it is a little short when reaching over my head. I am old and don't do much real work anymore so this coat is fine for me. I am sure it isn't snag proof.  The light weight is perfect for my locale,  inland just over 150 miles north of Galveston in mid-East Texaqs, and is warm even in the upper 20s.  It's water resistant for about 5 minutes or twenty feet in a light rain.  For my purposes,  it is perfect....cheap, warm, easy care, and comfortable to wear in or out of the truck. The pictures on Amazon are accurate.  It's Amazon Basic and nothing more; good enough quality for a low price, so, don't expect it to match the big name arctic outdoor brands.  Good utility. Low cost. Everyday and then throw it away type of coat."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Heads up on sizing,4,"I ordered a medium and I'm 5'9"", 170lb with an athletic, lean build. Even though I normally wear large sizes for most jackets, medium for this particular brand fits like a glove!! I couldn't have asked for a better fit! This jacket is an amazing value when factoring in the quality, sizing and color options. **Pay close attention to the arm length on the sizing chart and the model in the pictures - he's 6'1"" and is wearing a medium. Although models are on the lean side, they usually have broad shoulders so medium seems a bit off to me for someone with a 6'1"" stature, but it makes sense for athletic builds."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,A bargin!,5,"I love down jackets.  I know this isnt down, but I wanted a synthetic puffer jacket to use in the wetter weather where down isnt the best option.  I picked this up on a whim from a lightning deal to try it out.Its good down to about 35-40F with light activity, or below freezing with moderate activity.Packs down well into the provided bag, I tossed a pair of light gloves and hat in there as well and can keep it in my hiking pack for when the weather cools down.  Size large fits me reasonably well, (6' 200lbs athletic build and fit) I can easily wear a sweatshirt or fleece underneath to stay warmer.  Would be nice to get some adjustable elastic on the bottom, but its a solid nice jacket as it is."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Good for light use,3,"The good:-The fit is great! I have an XS (5'9"" and 140lbs)-Warm enough for those 40 degree days, can be layered for colder days-zippers on pockets seem sturdy, 1 month of heavy use and no breakage-the green is a nice color that can be worn with pretty much anythingThe Bad:-The material is a bit thin and doesn't hold up well if you are using constantly-less than a month of wear and a hole developed on the back of the sleeve."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Looks are deceiving,1,When I ordered the jacket it was originally for a friend but when he tried it on it was too small ..It fit my 10 yr old who wears size 10/12 in boys clothing... the jacket is also very thin and more like a windbreaker with a bit of stuffing . I was not impressed.  I will not purchase again
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Very well made lightweight jacket at a value price,5,"I was looking for a somewhat lightweight insulated nylon jacket and discovered this item.  Read the reviews and decided to give it a go.  Jacket arrived promptly and the package actually fit inside my standard size mail box!  Upon removal, the package expanded to a more expected size.  The jacket is slightly bigger in the torso but I selected XL as I have rather long arms so overall the fit is more than acceptable.  Construction is extremely good - no loose threads or crooked seams and the nylon shell is super soft.  I thought the description indicated the lining was nylon too but the tag stated polyester - it sure looks and feels like the nylon shell though.  Anyway, overall a worthwhile purchase for a nice looking and well made jacket that would be perfect for travel as it's very light and compacts down to a reduced volume.  Not sure of the warmth value as it's in the upper 90's here in central VA now but it should provide adequate protection down to the 40's in a pinch."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"So thin, why bother?",2,It is for extremely light weather!You could just as easily wear a hoodie and get the same amount of warmth and protection. It is barely stopped at all and I didn't recognize it for any kind of cold weather unless you want to freeze
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Indeed lightweight,  but sleeves cut too short, and poor fit around the body",1,"Amazon's choice products are usually good. This was an exception. I ordered a men's large, It was short on the sleeves -- I would estimate about a 32"" sleeve. It was balloon-like around the waist. Overall, it was sized very peculiarly. I tried it a couple of times and then just gave up and donated it to a local charity."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great sleeve length!,5,"This jacket is perfect for running around town! It’s a thin puffer, gorgeous color that looks textured, but is all smooth. The fabric is very soft, but so far seems durable. I had ordered a number of options for a quick daily wearer and something I could use for cross country skiing. This is the only one that fit perfectly. I am 5’11” and generally wear a womens 2x. I needed an option that wasn’t as long or bulky as my winter parka. The sleeves are surprisingly long (an issue I have with most long sleeves, being too short). The jacket hits just about hip length. Highly recommend."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Adequately warm for the money,5,Nice warm jacket.  Limited color selection for medium.  Good zipper.  Handwarmer pockets are deep and zippered. Two inside pockets are very deep and wide.  The stand-up collar is extra thick and snugly hugs my neck for warmth.  I wear a LL Bean river driver double layer 40% wool base layer and I'm good down to the twenties.  I like the jacket a lot and you can't beat $39.  I see Amazon Essentials is inexpensive and good quality.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great Product!,5,"I was beginning to shop for a soft puffer jacket for the cooler weather and happened to stumble across the Amazon Essentials line. Based on the description, the jacket seem to have everything I was looking for at an incredible price compared to other name brands. After reading the many reviews, I decided to give it a shot. The material is incredibly soft and the jacket seems to be well-made. I looked it over and didn’t find any flaws whatsoever despite what others have experienced. The jacket fits me perfectly and is surprisingly warm. For the price, you simply cannot beat the quality of this jacket. I am going to put it through its paces and hope it holds up as expected. If so, I will definitely order another in a different color."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Very lightweight, big pockets and surprisingly warm.",5,"Very lightweight, big pockets and surprisingly warm. Bought this for an upcoming trip because it packed so small. But started wearing it here on the frozen north wheee th high was 5 degrees F. Wore a sweater underneath, and it was surprisingly warm. Used it for a few block walk and it pretty warm. Reasonable price. I wear it all the time, though I bought It just for travel."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Fits well and is a bargain.,4,"I have a couple of similar jackets, but they are not water-resistant, which is why I bought this one.  The quality is above average, it is light and looks nice.  It is also quite warm and packs into nothing.  I just leave the little bag attached to the label in back so I don't lose it. It is so thin and light you don't even know it is there.I don't think it will stand up to a rainstorm, but probably won't get soaked in a light drizzle.  Great for travel.  I do wish it had a hood  rolled in the stand up collar - that would be perfect."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Good deal, like It",5,"Giving it 5 stars given the price. It compares reasonably well to my Arc'Teryx Thorium, which cost $200+. At the price, I can wear it for outdoor sports and not worry about it. Outside fabric is slippery, which also makes it a nice mid-layer. I am 6' tall, 160 pounds, medium fits a smidge loosely which gives me room to swing a golf club or tennis racket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,A Great Value and Fits Great,5,"I was debating buying a Patagonia jacket but really didn't want to fork out hundreds of dollars when Amazon offers what I believe to be the same thing with this jacket.  It came yesterday, I tried it on and it fits perfect.  I'm 6 foot tall and 165 pounds and the medium is a perfect fit.  This jacket is super warm, comfortable, light, and just as stylish as the Patagonia without spending hundreds more for just a Patagonia logo.Highly recommended, I'll probably buy another color as well.  Good Job Amazon!Dr. Dave"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Binding across the back and shoulders and not at all warm.,2,"The first thing I noticed was that if I raise my arms up the coat is pulling tight in the back and shoulders. I purchased a medium and I am 5'10"" and 160 lbs. The coat hangs well below my waste and is not terribly attractive in cut. I tested it out by spending some time in the garage organizing a few things and then driving down to the mailbox to pick up the mail. The outdoor temperature was 29 degrees F and I was freezing the entire time I was outside even in the car. The filling in this is about as thick as loose leaf paper.  It's really just a puffy wind breaker. All in all this was a major disappointment."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Light and warm,4,"Bought to use as a lightweight liner jkt. under waterproof shell, so I wanted a snug fit.  A little tight under arms, but not enough to be annoying. I would say it runs on the smaller side of an XL fit. If you're looking for a loose fit or wear over heavy shirts, consider going up a size.  Definitely warm for the weight. Do wish the collar folded down, instead of always staying up. Price was great compared to similar jkts. Biggest beef was with lazy Amazon Prime driver, who left pkg. on steps right next to road, instead of my front porch or garage door. Never had that problem when mailcarrier delivers Amazon."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Charcoal Heather gray SMALL,3,"The build quality was amazing. No loose threads or rips like some other ones ive tried. The only issue I found in the small version is the waist/stomach area is too wide. The chest fits just right, shoulders are a little tight but the stomach area is like a med-large size.  It will be comfortable for those with a little gut as its will not be tight but i expected at least something a little more form fitting. 5'11 165lbs  athletic build for reference.  It honestly feels like its a mix of a xs shoulder, small chest, and medium+ stomach area combination. Very strange but if they ever get this corrected or if these details do not bother you, its a solid jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Not Very Warm,1,"I am disappointed with this jacket! It is packable and fits as expected, but is not nearly warm enough for the price. There were others for less, but I chose the Amazon Essentials one because I expected it to be warmer, especially for $40.  With the weather this year, I hadn't had a chance to really test it out until recently and now I can't return it. It is okay for fall temperatures,  but nothing colder. Please take this into consideration when deciding whether to purchase this jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,A great value,5,"I use this in lieu of a sweater inside and it works very well for this purpose.  It is lightweight and warm, plus it is not itchy like so many sweaters.  It also is useful for wearing outside, although I do not use it for that purpose.  Perhaps a  $150 down version would be even more comfortable, but I cannot imagine it would be worth the difference in price.  From my experience, the sizing skews to the small side -- so I kept an XL version when often an L works better for me.  I like the extra room."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Nice jacket for the money,5,"Good value for a handy upper layer. Many discussions about size: I am a 35 waist, 200 pounds, wear a 43 or 44L jacket, 34 sleeve and am 6-1"".  I ordered the XL at first and I was able to pinch about three inches of extra jacket at belly and sleeves were maybe 2"" too long for me.I returned it and ordered the large and it's perfect. I intended to use this in the shoulder seasons as a super packable backup where this would be layered over light or medium thermal shirt and possibly a thinner weight fleece. If you plan on wearing this over bulky sweaters or sweathirts, maybe upsize."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Fine Jacket for the Price,5,"Upon first examination, the jacket appears well-stitched and well-made. I am 5'11"" tall and weigh 180, and ordered this by waist size (37-41). As I wanted room for extra layers, I ordered and XL and find it is the perfect size. I tried the jacket over one of my winter vests, and had plenty of room left for easy zipping up, and ease of movement. I haven't tried it out in cold weather, which is about a month away, but I am sure it will keep me warm. I am satisfied with the quality of the item, and the price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Too tight at chest and arms.,1,"I'm 5'8"", 175lb, 41"" chest and this jacket, in medium, is tight across the chest and upper arms.  It pulls in on the outside of the arms at chest level with my arms by my side.  Try to move my arms forward and it pulls across the back.  Sleeve length, jacket length, and neck opening are all good but I'm a very average medium and I think this ""medium"" jacket should have a more generous fitting for the chest.  Ideally I'd like to be able to wear a light weight fleece beneath as well.  Returned the jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Styling!,5,"This jacket looks great! It has a nice sleek design that makes me feel like a millionaire.It’s very warm too, I live in the northwest and endure snow all the time, but I haven’t felt cold at all in this.It’s very lightweight and packs down to the size of a water bottle.One complaint is the cuffs are starting to tear. Be gentle with this."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Light, but not very warm",5,"ProsVery lightGood color for meNice an large hand pocketsGreat for wearing indoors when wife sets temperatures close to freezing. When she has one of her tropical heatwaves.ConsNot warm in cold temperatures ,anything below 50 degrees. Must have a middle layer.Wanted a jacket to wear over a T-shirt wile doing light outdoors activities like walking dogs. Wish it was just a little warmer..Overall a decent light jacket. Don’t expect to be warm with only a T-shirt in cooler weatherI’m still looking for that perfect jack"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Perfect Grab Jacket,5,"Perfect for mild weather ventures, like walking the dog, getting the mail or driving to the stores. A fantastic Spring and Fall jacket as well. I trust the ""AmazonBasics"" brand and have acquired a nice collection that has served me well. This brand has the quality features of the more expensive brands and the workmanship is a cut above the rest. I have yet to encounter any issues or problems with these great products. No I have not been compensated for this review."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,It's great!,5,My husband loves this black jacket! He already has a blue one that he loves but he was careless working in the yard and tore it so now it is his 'yard jacket'. This black one he will not wear it to work in the yard.  It is warm without being too warm and it looks good to wear out to most restaurants and shopping and visiting etc...BTW: It could be used to work in the yard but you just have to be more careful around 'tools' .....like my husband was not!
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"If you buy, you will buy another jacket soon",1,"Cheap stuff, very thin, this product can rip by accidentally hitting something like the wall, or seating in the car. It’s not going to last more then a day if your rough."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Light weight, decent quality (for the price) Size varies!!",5,"Light weight, good quality for the price. I ordered a small and a extra small. Because the reviews have mixed opinions about the size and they were right. The size varies. I am 5'7 150 pounds and Small usually fits in most brands.  This small was to long and kinda puffed out at the waist (it just looked baggy all over). The extra small fit great still loose enough to wear a t shirt and a sweater under."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Don't let the price and reviews fool you, its a great jacket.",5,"Listen, is it Patagonia, no. But it is a solidly built jacket that shows to actual color in photo. I purchased mine to fit under a ski shell and wear a a light weight jacket. It works as needed and has been a solid performer.This is a solid budget conscious jacket and performs well. I have had no complaints and my wife and remarked its a good looking jacket.I am 5-11 with a moderate build. It is well fitting and does not have any negatives I know of.Zipper pockets and pockets on the inside of the jacket helped when skiing.Good choice if you are looking for a short term solution or do not want to waste a lot of money on a puffer style jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Surprised me,5,I bought this for my son as a lightweight jacket to run around in. He didn’t want it so I wear it at work- which I am in and out of the building constantly surprisingly it is comfortable and warm. I wore it more than my sweaters. And during the winter it was thin enough to wear under my winter coat and truly kept me warm. I didn’t expect I would love it but I do. My only wish is that had I known it was for me I would have purchased a different color.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Solid wind jacket for the price,5,Normal issues for people who workout - you need a large for your chest and medium for your waist. I settled for a large so 1. It doesn't look like a tube sock and 2. I can wear a sweater or a hoodie under it.Like the title says - great jacket for the price. It keeps you warm by blocking wind and moisture. Works really well and I'm very pleased.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Is form or function more important to you?,4,This jacket is surprisingly warm for a packable jacket. It doesn't pack down tiny nor fit in its own pocket. But it is still convenient for travel or to keep in the back of the car etc. Not the most stylish jacket of this type. Sort of a boxy fit and the actual material design is a little dated. So depends if form or function are more important to you.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Inexpensive alternative for backpacking.,3,"I’m 5’11 215lbs and bought a size L.  I tend to like my clothing somewhat fitting, not baggy. This jacket looks great and had enough length.  I purchased this as an option for random backpacking trips as it Is lightweight and it compresses down pretty well.  Problem is, it doesn’t keep you very warm. I was cold as hell out in the woods at around 45-degrees with multiple layers.  I live in Phoenix, so yes, 45 degrees is cold!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Just what I was looking for!,5,"Ive been looking for a good puffer jacket without breaking the bank.  This is it!  Im 6'2"", 190 lbs.  I ordered a L and it fits perfectly.  Everyone seems to have black ones, but I wanted green.  Its very nice and looks just like the one in the pictures.  I did wear it flyfishing and my elbows touched the water a few times... the water just rolled off.  Its not water proof, but very resistant.  Im highly recommending this one!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Good price, however, you get what you pay for",4,"The jacket is a bit large, which doesn’t effect my rating (common problem for sizing to be difficult as I wear a L-XXL depending on the maker). However, I’m disappointed with the pack down size vs. the fill. The jacket does not have a very impressive fill installation, so one would believe it should pack down smaller than it actually does. However, the weight is almost unnoticeable. Unsure if I should return and get the next size down. Sleeve length is adequate, common problem for my height.For reference I am a 6’4” 275 man, I have a muscular+husky build."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Perfect for what it is,5,"This is a perfect light weight puffer jacket. It looks good, fits perfectly, performs well (warm and water resistant) and does all that for a great price. An added bonus is no ugly external brand badges!It's not fancy, but it is my new favorite jacket for temperatures down to 40. I have not had it long enough to gauge longevity but at this price I would be happy if it lasts even a couple of years."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,It does well in WNC,5,I received the jacket on time in great shape. The jacket is a great cool weather rain repellent. I wore it in a drizzly rain at 38 degrees and was very comfortable. It’s a tad longer than I expected and covers my rump well... the pack ability of this jacket makes it great for hiking/ overnight camping... zipper is good quality and although it feels cheap it has held up well after a few months of hard use
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Very average,3,I. Have found out that unlike other Amazon products their clothing is basically inferior to the brands. This puff jacket is not a winter jacket and has very little “puff”. Maybe worn on a 50 degree day in the spring. I am going pay for it by turning my heat down to 68 and wear it in the house.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Slender Build Fit,5,Just got it so a full review wouldn't be fair. Given my slender frame wanted to share some context...I had to return a large cause the chest/stomach area was massive. Got the medium and it fits much better. The downside of the medium is that the length (including sleeves) is a touch smaller than I'd like but feels way better than the large did overall.If you're slender frame and between sizes I'd go with the lower. I have fairly long torso and arms but if yours are extremely long you might look at another coat as you probably won't find a fit that is ideal.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Doesn’t look nearly as good as the pictures,1,"The sleeves are way too long compared to the rest of the jacket, so the fit is awkward. The yellow color that is in the product images is totally inaccurate. In real life it is not bright and lemon-colored; it is a dull, dirty-looking yellow. Usually Amazon Essentials products tend to be of better quality than this. I am pretty disappointed, but it was fairly cheap so I won’t bother returning it."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great jacket,5,Great puff jacket for an exceptional price. I received lots of compliments on it and it worked great on a business trip to Chicago in winter. The stuff sack it comes with is great and makes this a really useful jacket to bring in my carry on. Just out the bag in one of the inside pockets and you will never notice it. The only issue I had is that it is slightly too tight on my shoulders so it’s a little restrictive if I am stretching my arms out but that is a common problem for me and I think it is more my shoulders being too broad than this jacket being too small.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Good Jacket,5,"The jacket is light and can easily be rolled and placed into the accompanying storage bag. It is good to use in a cool setting... and can be used inside as a cover up when traveling. Size isn't quite right. The arm holes and sleeves seem to be a bit small. Sleeve length is a tad short. I ordered a large, I'm 5'8"" - but the sleeves are short if I reach to grab a door knob. Otherwise good jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"So far, I really like it!",5,"Female, 5’7 with a large chest and about 165 lbs. I was worried about ordering a Men’s medium. After reading many reviews, I decided on the medium. I was worried that it would be too small but, I’m not a fan of jackets that are too big.When I first tried this on I thought that I would probably return it due to being too small. With careful consideration, I’ve decided to stick with this size. I bought this jacket to take my evening walks. It was important to me to find a warm and well fitting jacket.The arms are perfect in length, the hip area fits snug but not tight and I can zip it up and feel very comfortable. I would have to say that this is very true to size. It’s also very warm! I just got it but put it on to go outside to talk to a neighbor. I was outside for 30 min. In 34 degree temperature (not too cold) and actually felt a little warm.Overall, I love this jacket and am looking forward to wearing it on my walks.I’ll probably post an update after a few walks."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Amazing!,5,"When I first held this product I thought no way this will be warm with how light it is. Well it arrived early morning and the temp was 36F. Straight out of the box I put it on and went outside.  Short story even shorter ... don't hesitate to get this, there was no major wind or foul weather but this thing will retire my trusty old heavy jacket for sure! The only cold I did feel with just this and a polyester shirt was the air coming up from the waist gap i created with my hands in the pocket. This has amazing warmth to weight ratio, I'll be buying more! I want this in a pants version too!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,6’ 4” 195lbs large fit me well,4,"I can’t say how warm the jacket it as I just got it today and it’s 105 degrees here in Arizona now. But it fits me well. I’m 6’4” 195 lbs and ordered the large. I bought a puffy jacket from a major hunting brand of clothing 2 years ago and paid $270 for it. That jacket has down insulation in it, so I know it will be warmer, and it has a hood. But this Amazon basics jacket was only $18!! I will use it when I don’t want to use my expensive jacket. I’ll use it for casual wear and around camp when I’m camping and things like that."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Nice jacket,4,"A good buy. To be picky.... may not be as warm on colder days as others have stated it was. Seems a bit light for the kind of jacket, more a a faux puffy jacket. Elastic around wrist is non existent. But for the price I expect to wear a lot for daytime use...."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"A little big, but ok",5,"I bought this to go backpacking.  It is a bit big, but honestly when I put on my pack it kind of works better because I have more room to move around in it, but a medium would have been best.  I am 5'8"" and about 190lbs, non muscular.  But this is a nice, light jacket that will work well for my needs."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Bought 2 more,5,"Better than some of my more expensive jackets that’s 3x the price. I highly recommend this one especially if you spend a lot of time out in the cold. I’ve worn this jacket in light rain and snow, while the exterior gets wet, never gets to the inside. I also wear it on my motorcycle and it’s great for keeping the wind out. I was so impressed I bought 2 more. You won’t be disappointed!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,great budget mid layer option for hikers.,5,Great budget and lightweight hiking/travel jacket. I love it and have gotten many compliments. I use it as a mid layer on backpacking or hiking trips. Is enough insulation to be comfortable down to about 40-ish degrees F- by itself.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great jacket,5,I purchased 2 of these jackets last year and this is my third for the family.  These jackets are great puffers and easily compete with North Face and Columbia for style and quality but beat them on price.  Very comfortable jacket for camping and hiking.  My son and I did a Rocky Mountain hike for 2 weeks and these jackets did outstanding for us on the trail.  Highly recommend and comes with a stuff sack!
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Better Than Expected!!,5,"Wanted economical jacket. No high expectations. Just needed a casual jacket.Was surprised by the quality, construction, and perfect fit!!Exceeded all my expectations!!Great value.I would have been happy if this jacket had cost $10 more! lolSo obviously great jacket at this price point.Highly recommended!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Super Deal Better than I Expected,5,"Super awesome jacket. I didn't expected it to be warm in 30 degree weather, but I was. It's my favorite jacket now. Great for traveling. Rolls up into the little pouch they give you and stuffs right into the suitcase no problem. Fits great in a backpack as well. I am going to order another color and make that my new favorite jacket too."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Very comfortable and warm,5,This is the second time I purchased this coat...the first one I trashed at work.These coats are a great alternative to the much higher priced ones....They are warm and lightweight feeling..Very good product for the price.E
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Surprisingly Warm,5,"The jacket is comfortable and looses enough to be layered up. I've used this in cold weather from the low 20's and 30's (Fahrenheit) and have been surprisingly warm and comfortable. It fits below the belt and none of my longer sweaters and hoodies show, that's important to me.I am very happy with this purchase and it's very warm being so thin."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Good quilted jacket,5,"This is a really good quilted jacket, especially for the price. Although the fill isn't very heavy, it's surprisingly warm. In fact, it's about as warm as my wool peacoat at a fraction of the weight. I'm close to 6'1"", broad-shouldered, have a fairly athletic build and weigh around 191 pounds. The large fits me just right with some room for layering."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great value,5,"This is a great value puffer jacket. It will never compete against the 800 fill power down jackets that weigh 8-9 ounces (it you're counting pounds for backpacking) and cost $300-$400, but for forty bucks it's a nice, warm jacket. I'm 6'1"" at 165 lbs and the medium fits perfectly. It weighs 13.8 ounces including the stuff sack which fits it perfectly."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Decent, but fights tight.",4,"Large shirts and jackets are usually a little big on me, but I bought a large in this jacket, and it's actually pretty tight in the chest and shoulders.  The sleeve length is fine, but it's pretty small in the body.  Other than that, I like it ok.  Can't say I'm overly impressed with the quality, but it's decent for the price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great for the price,5,"I'm 6'1"" and 210 and ordered a large. Fit is a little tight through the shoulders and loose in the waist (I'm a 34""). I know an XL would probably be too big. Sleeve length is just right. Very nice considering the price on this one - and a major upgrade from the jacket I've been wearing for 20+ years. Nice style and warm enough for me this winter."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Very nice jacket!,5,"I like this jacket very much. The day it arrived, I wore it on a 4.5 mile walk in 40-42 degree weather with only at tee shirt underneath — in comfort all the way. It comes with a small sack into which the jacket can be stuffed, and the jacket includes a roomy inside pocket in which to carry the sack and two roomy pockets outside. Oh! Also it looks good!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,NIce puffer coat!,5,"Wanted a packable coat for travel, this is excellent! Reasonably priced, fits well (I'm 5 ft 8 in, about 190 pounds).  Got it just for travel, but wear it on cold days to work, and it keeps me comfortable.  If I was outside in Iowa for a long time (like an hour or more at zero farenheit), it would probably not be quite warm enough. But for casual use, even in cold weather, it is lightweight, warm, and non-restricting. Good value"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Large inside pockets!,5,I like to carry my phone inside my jackets and this one has 2 pockets. A drawstring at the waistband can be cinched up when the wind blows but I only do that when necessary. Of course it's lightweight and very warm. The zipper works like it should too; seems like zippers lately are too flimsy but this one's fine. Zips up to the collar which is a nice touch to keep the wind out. The outside pockets are deep and great for hand-warmers.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,It's light-weight and warm!,5,"This jacket is perfect for those cold/cooler Florida nights and days!  I know people always laugh about it being cold in Florida, but the morning after I got the jacket the temperature in West Palm Beach was 39 degrees.  Now for West Palm Beach, this is cold, and we have been having several of these in the past few weeks!  I love it!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Decent quality, but not a great fit.",4,"Made the mistake of not reading all the reviews and relying on just the top ones that the site conveniently displayed.  i am 5.9, 160lbs and usually go with the medium fit on most apparels and therefore figured would work for this as well. the shoulder and chest areas are proportionate but below it is where the issue is. for those with a slimmer waist profile this jacket would appear ungainly and unwieldy. i am hesitant to try the smaller size since the shoulder and chest areas in the medium fit are ""just"" right for me and therefore the smaller size would probably be constricting.the quality is decent for the price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Awesome,5,Great quality. Stuffs into small bag easily that it came with. Wore this with a vest during a snow storm in northern New York and was comfortable while walking around. Pleased with this coat for the price. I could wear just a t shirt in 40 degree weather with this and be warm. Would fit great under a winter parka for super warmth.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,IT IS PACKABLE,5,We ordered 2 for our trip to the Great National parks tour this Summer.  We were told it could get a little chilly at night so a jacket would be advised.  We like these jackets because they fit well and are packable.  Lots of pockets and nice zippers too.  Comes with a compression sack.  I will update this review after our trup.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,For Backpacking,5,"Surprisingly good quality. I bought this for a February backpacking trip in the snow and was impressed. It stuffs very small and is very warm and light. It seems ""water resistant"" but certainly isn't ""water proof"". Held up well to it's first wash. I've gotten a surprising number of compliments about it wearing it around town. It's a flattering cut. The orange is loud."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Excellent jacket for the price.,4,"The jacket is nicely made. The stitching is good and the amount of fill is just right for a light-weight, packable down jacket. There are a lot of other brands that have jackets like this and this one is just as nice and at a great price.I am 5'10, 165 lbs and the medium fit great with one exception. On me, the jacket is a little longer than I would like. It came about 6 inches below my waist. I would have preferred it to sit at the waist."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great value,5,"I wanted a lightweight but inexpensive puffer layering jacket and this is great. I'm 6'1"" so I figured I'd try a men's item for the length and I got just what I wanted. This jacket really adjusts well with the temperature and keeps you warm but not overheating. I love that I can pack it up pretty small as well. Good purchase."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Excellent quality in a lightweight packable jacket,5,"Fits perfectly...like it was tailor made just for me.  The sleeves are properly tapered for a need tailored look.  Two large inner pockets will hold a lot.  I even put my 10.1 inch tablet in one pocket and zipped it up...it looked perfectly fine, not lopsided  No one would ever guess I had a tablet pc in the pocket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Good jacket for layering,5,"I’m 6’ 180 , 36” sleeve and wear a large, I ordered large. Nice fitted style but not tight. Good construction and feels great on. Light weight, I prefer to add layers. If I get too hot, I can peel a layer and not be stuck with a big bulky coat. Okay now the sleeves, they’re a bit short. 34” or 35” sleeve. There isn’t a ribbed cuff, but still a great jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Perfect fit and decent quality,5,"Perfect! Fit as expected; the only thing to mention is that olive is not a solid color, it is micro-heather olive and dark gray, but still looks great! Happy with this purchase."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great lightweight jacket,4,Great jacket for the price.  I wanted something warm but not too warm for winter bicycle riding.  This turned out to be perfect.  Breaks the wind nicely.  Offers warmth but not too much.  Also nice for walking when I just want a light jacket.  Seems well made.  Outside zip pockets plus two inside pockets for gloves or whatever.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Not a warm piece of clothing, mainly for temp's in the 50's",3,Very little packing inside the jacket which means only some protection from the cold. It is light 17 oz and packs away into a small pillow. Probably best on a sunny cold day in the upper 40's low 50's. The sleeves were not 35 as advertised but more 34ish. I'm satisfied but not going to tell anybody to buy this.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great jacket.,5,"Got this for my husband overseas bc he kept saying he was cold but wouldn't get a real coat(ugh, men). He loves it, nice and warm especially when layered with his sweater. He really likes that it packs down so small, worth his job he moves aping apt and can't have big built things. This fit the bill perfectly."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"wrong delivery, but OK product",5,"cozy, good fit size, exactly on time for this autumn in California where it just started being cold in the morning when I go out for a walk. This Amazon product is a nice one, yet it was delivered to a place without my apartment number hang there that I input in the delivery address placing the order, namely wrong delivery. I need you to improve this part in the whole process of deal. Then you are a good partner of mine for shopping business."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,looks like Costco...if you like that sort of thing.,3,"You get what you pay for.  It's a ""fake"" down jacket that looks fake and doesn't have the quality we were looking for.  Sent back...it was fraying already."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Fits small,4,If you are on the fence between two sizes then pick the larger size. For example I have a nearly identical jacket but it's REI brand and that one is size XL. So I ordered this jacket in XL but it was significantly too small and tight. So I'd have to get this jacket in a XXL.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Size up, order in advance! Returns are quick!",4,"Nice quality jacket for the price, unfortunately it was a Christmas gift, which I received too late and was way too small because I ordered the wrong size!  The person I ordered it for is about 5'8 weighs about 175 lbs. thinking a medium would work but found out he wears a large instead! He's not a big man, so that's why I say these jackets must run small for men's coats.The return went smoothly."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,TAKE THIS ON YOUR NEXT TRIP!,5,"Backpackers have limited room for non-essentials. This is essential! great warmth, huge pockets on the outside, and more deep pockets on the inside. super easy to stuff back in the bag. rained on us and this was dry in 30 min. and I didn't get wet. this is a fantastic addition to our travel bag. wish they had pants too lol"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Well made and a wonderful buy,5,I wear a 40 Regular coat with a 32” waist and this jacket in a size Medium fits perfectly. I like how it is tapered slightly st the waist so it doesn’t have a big boxy fit. This jacket is well made with durable zippers. A large assortment of colors and a low price make this a wonderful jacket for the money.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Ladies it’s great for us too! Not fitted but love it!!!,5,"Love this! It’s a mans jacket, I ordered small to leave room for sweaters and I love it! It’s less fitted than womens but the dusty blue is beautiful, the zippered pockets are deep and I’m thrilled! Women’s M or 8 , 5’6. 150. Lightweight and warm! Looked for woman’s for hours and after so many bad reviews on women’s took a chance on this! Love it!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great Buy.,5,"If you have to pack up and go, get this!  Perfect for our trip to the Canadian Rockies.  Fits snug in a small bag!  No need for a heavy coat.  I wish it had a hood."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Excellent Quality Great Price Awesome Fit5,5,This coat is as nice as the name brand competitor! Folds nicely and easily in the included pack. That makes it very handy to bring for extra layering or for emergency.This is a nice early spring coat and assume it will be my husband's go to for fall. Very pleased with this purchase
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great for the price,5,"I think this jacket met expectations.  We planned a quick trip to the snow and I needed a light-weight, water-proof jacket.  This was perfect for my son.  He wears a S or M in mens and this was a tad bit large, but he'll grow into this jacket by next year.  The green has a metallic sheen to it."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Perfect for a hiking jacket and so classy!,5,The color is awesome.  It is like a heather grey instead of a solid gray and this makes it look more classy.  It is washable and roomy enough to wear a sweatshirt under it.  The weight of it is perfect to throw it in the little bag and put it in your backpack for hiking.  I love it!!!
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Lightweight, warm, inexpensive, and  runs small",5,"This is a great jacket. It's lightweight but warm. It's great for really cold temps if you layer. My son is 15,  6' 2"" and 160 lbs. He wears a medium in most things. But the medium in this was just too small. Even with a thin shirt it was too tight. We reordered in a large and it's a perfect fit. He doesn't care much for wearing coats but has really been enjoying this jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Disappointing Quality,1,"I purchase this jacket and a grey fleece in early December for a trip Feb Snowboarding Trip that I planed the Feb 9th. First time I used it the zipper came apart and is unable to repair.  The jacket looked great, but quality is not the standard that Amazon Apparel normally delivers (my wife and I have purchase many items).Amazon was amazing with their customer service and offered to refund or provide a replacement.That being said, I'd probably look at alternative puffy jackets."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great Light Weight Jacket,5,"Jacket fits me just right and the sizes are accurate.  Overall, it is light and has so far kept me warm during the cold fall nights when I am walking my dog. The side pockets are deep enough that you will not lose any personal items by falling out.  For the price and value it is a great jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great Voat,5,I bought this jacket for Christmas for my husband and he loves it.  He 80 years old and getting fragile.  The coat is light weight and easy for him to get on and off easily.  I bought the dark grey and it’s a perfect color.  Very deep inside pockets and zippered outer pockets.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Not like they were made before,2,"This would have been my third same coat I bought. All XS. The orange one that arrived to me is HUGE! It fit almost like a men's Medium. The sleeves are 2"" long than my other XS jackets and the length of the jacket is at least 3"" longer. The sizing chart is wrong. Too bad Amazon blew it with the sizing on this one."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Very nice jacket I like it a lot,5,It's really great I got the small and it fits well perfectly. It's a little tight when you stretch your arms forward with the zipper on you can feel it near your shoulders but that's OK because I wanted a a fitted jacket instead and not bigger one like a medium. Still very comfortable for me I really love it keeps me nice and warm. It's stylish too.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Makes Every Parka & Coat Sub-Zero Wearable,5,"JUST what I needed to make old parkas warm enough!  I have two of these... one with a hood, one without, in colors that match several old and still-sturdy-but-not-warm-enough parkas.  I’m a small woman (5’, 105 lb) and the Mens XS fit perfectly!  These liners weigh nothing, slide onto my fleece clothing and sit inside my fleece-lined parkas beautifully.  Thank You!!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Mostly great,4,Hubby uses this for winter layering in Florida. He loves it because it adds a layer of warmth under his waterproof jacket or can be worn alone. The only problem is it snagged on something ( not hard to do )  and caused a small tear but he likes it enough to keep wearing it.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Impressive packable puffer jacket!,5,"After comparing several of the recognizable brands, (I.e., Patagonia, LL Bean, North Face, Eddie Bauer), i opted for the Amazon Essentials jacket. I wanted a weatherproof packable jacket to keep in truck in case of inclement weather. I have been overly impressed with this jacket. It is warm, waterproof, and the fit is superb. I highly recommend this jacket and the Amazon Essentials brand."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Great ""Light"" Jacket",5,"Formal or casual, this jacket is in that nice in-between space. It's not very warm, but it's good for mild days. I like the cut and sleeve length. It doesn't have any logos or markings of any kind. The pockets are deep and the zippers are of a medium quality. All in all a really great value..."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great jacket,4,Love this jacket. Anyone that knows me knows I never wear a coat or jacket. I bought this just for a 3 day winter storm hike. Stayed right around the 15 degree mark for most of the 3 days. I wore nothin' but a light base layer and a long sleeve shirt underneath. Never got cold. My only reason for not givin' a 5 star ratin' is the size. I wear large. The large was too big and saggy. I ordered a medium and it is a little tight around the shoulders. Could not find a happy medium.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great coat - buy one - you wont be sorry!,5,Extremely flattering and comfy. I purchased this coat for someone with a  noticeable scoliosis. This coat fits him perfect and glides ride over that issue without clinging. The fit is so flattering too. It skims the body without being overly tight or loose. Looks expensive. Solid choice. Im thrilled with it.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"OK, but not very warm by itself",4,"This is OK. It's very thin, and is only about as warm as a hooded sweatshirt, so for me was good down to about 50 degrees F.  It's really good as an indoor jacket in the winter, if you keep your thermostat turned down. It also works well outdoors when used in layers."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Nice Jacket, but too small in chest",3,"This jacket was purchased for a man with a 39"" chest and a slight build. A medium should have been perfect as the size chart indicated a medium is a 38-40"" chest. The jacket fit fine over just a t-shirt, but if layering for warmth is desired it is much too tight across the chest and under the arms. The jacket looks to be nicely made so will reorder in a large."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Nice looking.  Fit appropriate,5,"ProsReasonable price.Looks good.For 35 to 55 degree weatherColder weather need layersNice fit at wristsZips up around neck, comfortable.ConsNoneWould buy again"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Solid Quality and Excellent Value,5,"Great fit. Perfect for layering with a windbreaker over it. I keep it in my truck for the extreme temperature fluctuations we experience in Michigan. All four seasons could happen in a day!  I have a Patagonia Down Sweater. The polyester fill of this jacket cannot compare to the down/feather fill of the Patagonia. This jacket obviously would not be quite as warm. Also, this jacket does not have a draw string at the waist. That, perhaps, would be wishing too much for the price point.SIZING:  I'm between a 42 and 44 Regular, 16 1/2 neck and 34 1/2- 35 sleeve length. The large in this jacket hit all three just fine."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Fit right. Keeps me warm too.,5,I’m 5’11” and 195lbs. I ordered the large and it fits very well. The color is interesting because it’s gray and flaked? I don’t know how to describe it. It’s a random design or lines that makes a cool contrast.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Good quality and fit,5,"Very well made jacket and it fits great. Its lightweight but keeps you very warm even when it is windy. Hard to find colors/size in stock (I guess because they are selling well). If you are looking for a good packable jacket and give really care that it's not a big name brand, then it's a must buy."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,It’s not a down puffer jacket,2,I did an Amazon search for down puffer jacket. This one popped up and the price looked good so I bought it. But it’s not down. I think Amazon is just pushing their down-style jacket. Once I received it  I realized it was just artificial insulation and I returned it.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great Value,4,"Was a little skeptical on a $40 jacket from Amazon but it's a great value. I'm 6'1"" and 210 lbs and the extra large fit perfectly. The first thing out of my wife's mouth was, ""It fits you really well."" Thats always a good sign. Camo color was a little darker than in photo but I like it that way and it looks great. Highly recommended. Would purchase again."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Curt’s,4,Another apparel piece that was not true to size.  Have had good luck with ordering clothes online. Have had bad luck.  This was bad luck
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Folds up!,5,"Bought it for my skeptical boyfriend for x mas because he never wears a coat and we live in Colorado. I was very surprised how much he loves it. AND it folds up for travel in a pouch, super surprised. I forgot my coat one day and he gave it to me to wear and it was super light and very warm. My bf has broad shoulders and it fits perfect"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Great, But sticks to your skin if you sweat",4,"The jacket is great and fits well (I got a Large). It is WATER RESISTANT and keeps you relatively warm in early fall temperatures. Overall I'm SATISFIED with my purchase. At the current price point I definitely think IT'S A STEAL.However, my only qualm is that since the inside of the jacket is the same material as the outside of the jacket, any sweating you do MAKES THE JACKET STICK TO YOUR SKIN. This is especially bothersome when wearing half sleeve t-shirts."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Fit is not great,4,Jacket is good for the money. Sleeves are a little short but it’s a little long and loose around the waist. I’m 5’11 200lbs. 44 inch chest
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Cheap jacket,2,"I asked for a medium and they sent me a large, the quality/thickness of the jacket is very cheap. It’s just a cheap jacket, it adds some style to your outfit but if you’re buying this in hopes to stay warm and look good you should probably shop elsewhere."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great gift,5,I got this and a fleece camo zip up for my brother as a Christmas gift to wear as mid layers snowboarding and whatever else he feels like wearing them for and every time I see him he’s wearing this or the other one so he’s very pleased with his gift and I’m happy he liked it!
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Surprisingly Great,5,"I honestly wasn't expecting much considering the low price. I've been pleasantly surprised. I wear this everyday for my dog walks. It's been cold here, a low of 20 degrees the other morning, and this jacket keep me warm. My only complaint is I wish the bottom was just a bit tighter because on windy days some cold air penetrates up from the bottom. But other than that it's a great jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,perfect shirt jacket,5,...love the collar and cuffs they keep the wind out...this jacket is super soft...super warm...a great wind stopper too...yet won't get you overly warm inside the house...very very deep wide pockets... inside and outside the jacket..... for phone or gloves...  .....just love this jacket and if needed rolls up into a small pouch to stash till needed or in luggage...any color just get this before it is sold out...
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,fit and warm,5,"fix is excellent . i wear it inside during the winter. this keeps the thermostat at 68 or below. i gotta electric heat. it pays for it self in 1 night.in phoenix, it does get chilly at night. why waste money and TIME with a fireplace. and you can not take the fireplace with you."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great buy!,5,"I bought this & loved it so much that I wanted another.  Sold out!  So I bought another similarly priced one, and it was thin, zippers stuck and it was kind of a mess.  This one keeps me warm but not overheated when I walk to the train every day.  In the dead of winter I can wear a pullover under the jacket for extra warmth, but the jacket itself has good insulation."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Bought for a ten week winter trip through Europe, performed great!",5,"Lightweight and comfortable, warm and windproof.  This jacket performed very well and kept me warm and comfortable during long stretches outdoors in the cold and wind.  Zippers, pockets, seams, wrist elastic all held up well under heavy use and also in and out of the included stuff sack many times without deterioration.  I got caught out in the rain once and it soaked through, so not waterproof, but it dried out quickly.  I wouldn't use it for strenuous outdoor sport.  Still looks good as new and for the price a tremendous deal!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Perfect for safari game drives.,4,"Excellent for travel and backpacking.  Ultra light weight and easily folds into carry bag.  Fit is true.  However, I ordered the camel color, but it is more light brown or dark tan as the color lacks the yellow tint to be camel. (Thus, the four stars) So, the color is not true to picture. I plan to use it during the early morning and evening safari game drives when it is often 50*.  Water resistance is untested."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great Option,4,"I'd purchased this jacket for my son mainly for camping.  It is a great exterior layer when the temperature drops but when it is warm, it packs down nicely in a pouch that could easily be place in a backpack.  Overall the construction is nice.  Not sure about durability and how water-resistant it will be."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,The good well constructed puffer jacket,5,"I ordered this in a large and admit that maybe I should’ve done more research. I gave it five stars because it is a well constructed jacket. The sleeves fit well but it’s too roomy and figured now that a medium would’ve fit me better.  I’m in Southern California, Using this jacket with just a T-shirt in 45° weather and I’m still kept warm. I also get cold easy so maybe this gives you an idea of how warm the jacket can keep you. Anyway I missed the chance to return it so I’m stuck with it."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Light, yet very warm. Excellent look.",4,"This puffer jacket is light but very warm. Actually warmer than I thought.Not giving it 5 stars just because of the size description is a bit off. I did order size S, because I have 38.5 inch around the chest, but nevertheless the jacket is just a bit too big. I should have ordered X-Small then."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Definitely meets my needs at a reasonable price,5,"My first order was for a size small and it was too small.  The exchange and return was very easy.  The replacement jacket (a medium)  came on time as promised and fits well.  Its a nice jacket with more fill than a similar jacket of different brand has.  The jacket is warm and appears well made.  Time will tell if zippers, stiching, etc. last."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Lightweight yet warm!,5,"Great jacket. Fits a little big so if you’re a large, you can confidently order and fit a large. I ordered an XL and could have easily fit a L even with layers under it. Keeps my comfortable in the coldest conditions (camping, hiking, chilling on the patio)."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,RED - Darker than displayed in the picture. Not a bright red rather dark red / maroon,3,"Color is definitely darker hue than shown in the picture. I was expecting a brighter red rather than a darker red / maroonish color.Other than that, its whats to be expected. Fits looser than my North Face Versions of the same style but not terrible."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Warm, lightweight and comfortable",5,"Bought this for a trip to Switzerland because I wanted something lightweight but warm. This was perfect. It kept me warm and dry but wasn't heavy. I really like the jacket and the price is amazing. The only downside is, it is a little tight in the shoulders, but I workout pretty hard and my shoulders are board, so I may be a little larger there than is normal."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Very happy with this jacket.,5,"Was looking for a jacket like this for a while but refused to pay such high prices for the known brands. Took a risk and bought this one. Extremely happy with my purchase. It is right in the middle, not too hot, not too cold. Worked great around 25-30 degree weather and up. Didn't really use it under that temperature but I'm sure it will work fine."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Lightweight, but still warm.",5,"Although it is a lighter weight puffer jacket, it is a great walking jacket. I walk every day and this is a perfect weight. I’ve worn it on colder days with a sweatshirt underneath, temps around zero, and it was plenty warm. This jacket does not have a hood, so it’s much more comfortable to wear a hoodie underneath."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,HUBBY LOVES IT,5,"My husband was not a huge fan of puffer coats, having gotten one from a client which was just of so-so quality.He loves this one.  It is flattering and warm.  He can wear under a shell that he already has, so PERFECTO !!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Much better than expected,5,"I'm very pleased with this warm well-fitting jacket.  The look is comforting and I get a lot of compliments when out and about.  When it arrived I found it very flat like many reviewers, but from experience I knew it should improve and it is now my go-to layer for cold days.  On clear nice days it is on the outside and wet days I keep it under other layers.  Great buy; the designers and manufacturer did a great job on this one."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Great jacket,5,"Bought this for my brother’s birthday. He’s a fairly small guy, and wanted this so that he could layer it over his hoodie and shirt. It looks great on him, and he absolutely loves it. It looks expensive despite the convenient low price, and definitely keeps him warm as well."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Looks silly when you're sitting down,3,"Jacket is light and comfortable, it looks exactly how it feels. I returned the jacket because when I would sit down, the jacket bunched up in a funny looking way due to its pleated nature. This is a very personal preference, never the less I'm sure this review will be helpful to someone."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Grandson would not wear a coat in the winter.,5,I bought this for my grandson who refused to wear a coat in the winter time.  After he wore it once he decided it was a great idea and now always has it in his car just in case.  He has a slender build and a medium was just right.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"The best item, warm and inexpensive , all quality",5,"light weight, but extremely warm, fits great, comfortable...a real steal!@#$%^&*()"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Crazy for these jackets!,5,"I bought 2 of these jackets and 2 of the vests. With a wind block layer or a fleece over top, I am set for 4 seasons where I live. These are so lightweight and so cozy comfy, no other jacket can feel this good. Just crazy about them."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Love this jacket,4,"It's light, but it really keeps you warm. It feels like a down jacket, but it's synthetic, so you can put it in the wash. It comes with a small duffel to put it in. It's cut for men 5 ft. 8 in. and taller, so shorter men will find out it's one size bigger. If you wear a medium, just buy the small for this item."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,used item...,1,"put garment on. put right hand in pocket and pulled out a tube of Blistex and a stick of gum. Would like a ""new"" garment sent to me. also, with the size description being off, would like the size to be ""medium"". thanos, Al"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Nice lightweight jacket,5,"After reading all the reviews - I expected the jacket to come in pretty thin.  It was actually a little thicker that I thought it would be.  I wanted a nice Spring/Fall jacket for hiking that I could also use as a mid layer. This jacket fits the bill.  Lightweight, packable and has nice, deep zippered pockets on the outside, and 2 pockets on the inside. Even came with a little bag to stuff jacket in. For $30.00, I feel I got a nice little jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Love this lightweight coat,5,"The coat is light and comfortable, and provides enough warmth for me to stay comfortable as low as the 40s for fairly extended periods. For 30s, I found useful for shorter exposures or during exercise only. So far, it's been a favorite general purpose N. Texas winter coat for me. Take care not to lose the not-attached storage bag (about the only feature needing improvement). Excellent light coat."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Comfy & great price.,5,As advertised. It’s lightweight and super comfy!  I live in AZ so no need for a heavy jacket. This works great for me. I’ve only worn it about 5 times so not sure about long term durability but so far so good!
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Very happy with purchase...finally a reasonably priced jacket!,4,"I just received my jacket yesterday and so have only worn it to work this morning, but it survived its first Minnesota rainy/snowy mix pretty well.  I expected it to be just a tad warmer, but for $40 you cannot beat it.  I couldn't find any modern-looking jacket for that price that is in relatively decent condition.  I am very surprised with the quality during my first impressions.  I am heading to Sweden in a week so will add an update if it is not up to snuff.  Some people were dissing the deep pockets but I actually like that feature.  I expected to have a lack of down/material where the deep pockets were but the jacket has a normal amount of padding on top of the pockets.  I think the deep pockets will come in handy for traveling where I will have to be weary of where I keep my valuables.Overall, my first impression is that the jacket is very reasonable and a good jacket for warmer winter days/colder spring days."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Jacket is well made,3,The jacket was well made but very light. I couldn't wear it in cold weather.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Lightweight and comfortable,5,"I live in Fl., so there is no big demand for heavier winter coats. This is a nice lightweight comfortable coat  for the chilly times that can be layered easily with a polar fleece if additional warmth is needed."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,AMAZING JACKET,5,Looks exactly like the photo fits perfect excellent quality excellent zipper quality very happy with this purchase
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Good for the price,5,Jacket fit perfectly I’m 5’6 160 pounds and I got a small and it fits like I expected.
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Awesome for men and women!,5,I bought this because women’s jackets are overpriced and usually have sleeves that don’t reach my wrists. Freaking loooove this jacket. It’s simple and light. It’s very well made and would recommend to any gender!
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Cheap windbreaker,2,"First, it's just a windbreaker, not a jacket.  No insulation.  Fit and color are okay.  The zippers are cheap metal.  The main zipper is backwards for a man's jacket, better for a left-handed person.  The zippered pocket on the sleeve has the stitching coming loose after just three wearings, I'll have to mend it soon.  Next time I'll shop more carefully."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Wrong Gender Sent,3,"I ordered the Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Jacket, but received a Women's Jacket-Lightweight Jacket. The jacket itself fit perfectly, with the exception of the zipping on the wrong side for me. In fact, I like the jacket so much that I will order another ""Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Flight Bomber Jacket"".  However, if I receive another women's jacket I will return the item."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,CHEAP QUALITY. DONT WASTE MONEY,1,The product has a very cheap quality. The zippers are very cheap and the material used is extremely low quality
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,SOOO small!,4,"Let me start out by saying I had to order 3 of these, each one a different size up in order to find one that wasn't made for a 9 year old.These run super small. My shirt size is a USA medium/large, I'm 5 foot 11 muscular build, and the large was terribly small.I might have fit into it when I was 14, maybe.If you're going to order this, think 2 to 3 sizes bigger. The one that I eventually ended up getting that didn't constrict my body into unconciousness ended up being  XL, and it still fits a bit slim.Otherwise, it's a nice little super ultra light jacket. Kinda feels like wearing a garbage bag with some thin cloth around it, which was great during summer."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Shiny Zippers ruin the jacket,1,"Everything is fine about the jacket but the zippers are obnoxiously shiny and bright compared to the muted base color.  Looking at it all a person would think is SHINY ZIPPERS.  Pretty dorky looking for a bomber, which is supposed to be low profile and minimalistic.  The zippers are shinier than the pictures represent."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,A really slick and good looking jacket with an athletic fit.,5,"I picked this jacket up due to the generally positive reviews, and because my wife and I both thought it looked sharp.  I am 6'2"", 190 lbs.  I have a fairly athletic build. 32"" waist and 44"" jacket, and I purchased the large.  It fits me like I had it made to measure.  Plenty of sleeve length, a good fit around the wrists and neck, and surprisingly, a taper to the waist that is not often found in inexpensive clothes.  It produces a leaner profile.  The zippers are of excellent quality with substantial all-steel pulls.  The left bicep pocket is actually useful at times, but I mostly keep candy in it. It would probably work well for an ipod.  This is a good light jacket for athletic use or in moderate weather.  I have had this jacket a little while and it does a pretty good job of stopping rain and wind from spoiling your fun, and is also stylish enough to wear casually."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,"Does not keep you warm but its light, stylish, high-quality and windbreaker-ish",4,"I bought this for my boyfriend.What i do like is the material its a wind breaker but its so smooth like, high quality material. The jacket is light but heavier than a windbreaker but i doubt you can feel the difference when you put it on. The zipper is so smooth too when you zip up and down. Doesn't make that nasty cheap zippers noise or stops you every inch. But I dont like how there's no patting or that criss cross patting to keep you warm like at least a little. I thought I bought a ""bomber jacket"" not a bomber jacket like that's a wind breaker. I will be keeping it though. Luckily I bought a bigger size on accident. I'll just have my boyfriend wear it over a hooded sweater."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Comfy well-make jacket,5,"Generally, I quite like this jacket and I think I got good value for my money. If I could make one small change, I wish there was a Velcro or snap closure on the inner pocket. I use it for my cell phone, but the lack of a closure means there is nothing to keep the cell from falling out if I, say, take my jacket off and set it somewhere. There is a zipper pocket on the left sleeve, but I prefer to keep my cell on the inside pocket. Even so, I'm not sorry I bought it; nice jacket for the price."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,It’s a great jacket!,5,"This jacket is great! You might want to order a size bigger though, unless you are super fit with six pack abs and not really broad shoulders. I usually wear an XL but I had to order the 2X. I’m 5’8” and weigh 220, so I’m a pretty big solid dude. Anyways, the color of this jacket in that green is awesome. Goes with my camouflage pants, some people even say it brings out the color in my eyes. I wore it out to dinner and received a few compliments and someone even asked me where I bought this sweet jacket at. You should have seen the look on their face when I told them I bought it off Amazon! Great Jacket, Great Quality, Great Color and Great Price!"
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Ran small,4,"I usually wear an XL in my shorts, and jackets, in order for them to be a little loose and comfortable.  This jacket was way too tight in the body, and too short in the torso.  I was surprised that the arms were an okay length, as that is typically where coats and jackets fail me.  I do think I could have gotten used to the zipper pull being on the other side of normal (zipper on the left, versus the right)... but I've no choice but to return this, and consider the next size up."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,My grandson has it,5,Very nice jacket. Appears well made. Sticking is great and without a flaw. Material is lightweight and very comfortable. So much so that my grandson decided he would wear it. So it was the week after his birthday so I gave him another birthday gift. I thought it really said something about the jacket the he tried it on and fit so well he didn't want to take it of.  It fit both of us well and for me as expected. I now am in the market again for me another jacket and considering the same jacket but probably a different color. Don't want to crowd his style.
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Very disappointed with the color - color (Royal Blue) is two shades lighter than image on Amazon,2,"Royal Blue - TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual - Fabric feels good (large size - I'm 6:2, medium build), but Royal Blue color is lighter color and sheen duller than advertised - I was hoping for the color in Amazon roll-over. Metal zipper is a bit harder to zip/unzip but still seems good quality. If you are buying dependent on color, think twice. Same was true from the Khaki #02 color was lighter and duller than representation on Amazon."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Solid jacket,5,"Fit as i expected, i have a shorter torso so maybe it was just me or my preference but the length was maybe 2-3 inches longer than id like but the length in the arms was perfect. The quality of the jacket is easily worth the price. Nice color as well."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,"Great looking, well-constructed, fall/spring jacket",5,"My son chose this jacket and has worn it every day since. It looks more mature than pulling on a hoodie and he hates the ""puffy"" look so this worked well for him. Warm enough for cool fall/spring days, simple lines, small details like the zipper on the sleeve all make it a good choice.  Well constructed jacket and the price was an added bonus."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,"Nice Jacket, but Runs Small",5,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He had been wanting it for a while and was on his wishlist.  However, when it arrived, I knew that it would be too small.  Overall he loved it and it was exactly what he wanted.  It just didn't fit.  It does run small."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Fitz just right,4,"Liked this jacket it fits just right. It was just what I was looking for.Only one but on the jacket, the zippers are on the left side, I don't know what is happening with today's manufacturers but they're making all these zippers  on the left side. Other than that I like the jacket. I have received nothing but compliments on the jacket."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,"Bought a size up, and the arms are too tight",2,"I purchased this jacket for my boyfriend'a starlord cosplay. The reviews from others suggested buying a size up, so I did. Quality of material is great and the color is perfect, but it is almost like they sewed the wrong arms on the jacket. The width of the arms was so tiny and tight for an XL. I wear a small and it just barely fits the width of my arms. I will have to return this one, and have ordered a size up so hopefully the arms are better on that one. But this cosplay needs to be done by the weekend so I was forced to pay for overnight shipping this time around... :("
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Fits great and very light,4,"Perfect lightweight spring jacket. It’s ad described and fits great reason for 4 stars is that there are a few loose strings on the inside of the jacket. I don’t expect it to last more than maybe this spring and early fall but it was pretty cheap so I didn’t expect much more. All in all, great fit but not the best quality."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Tacvasen makes GOOD stuff,5,"Hammacher-Schlemmer sold me a WWII bomber jacket made by Tacvacsen, total $119. Bought exaxt jacket for my wife here for $45. H-S told me it's not the same. I e-mailed ""Colin"" the PROOF. He didn't answer. GREAT jackets. Wanted one for my wife, FORGOT I'd already bought her a NB. I'm very high on this producer."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Looks more expensive than it is,5,"I get daily compliments about this jacket; despite it costing less than 10% of my leather jacket, this gets way more compliments. I love it! It’s not really meant for the rain even though it looks like it is — I still wear it and risk getting soaked :)"
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,I like,5,Light jacket is very well made.  I was especially impressed with the silk like liner that lines the whole jacket.  I’m really glad I bought this jacket and the fit is perfect!
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,This isn't a men's jacket. False advertising.,1,This is a women's jacket that they are selling as a men's. The zipper is on the wrong side and its tailored to fit women. It's also very thing and feels like it's made of a cheap tent. Do not buy.
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Two sizes too small,3,"I normally wear Large in shirts and jackets. I wanted a light weight jacket to wear over a fleece jacket, so I ordered X-Large in khaki. This one seems more like a Medium, too tight for me.Others have complained about wrinkles, and it's easy to see why. Mine came stuffed into an 11"" x 12"" Zip-Loc type bag. Those wrinkles might have smoothed out after washing, but who knows?The quality of construction, stitching, zippers, etc seems fine. Amazon made the return virtually effortless."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,fits perfectly,5,I needed a lightweight jacket that I could wear when it was slightly windy or when it was a little cool out without making me get overheated.  this jacket delivers and best of all does not look cheap.
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Nice light jacket,4,I use this to ride my cafe racer. I wear a hoodie under it and it does the job blocking the wind. I like the look of this jacket. Glad I ordered it. Looks like the picture. No complaints.
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,"Great, minus the pine fresh scent!",5,"Great product. Exactly what I expected and looks really nice in person. Pretty good quality considering the price, and overall happy with the purchase.One minor detail, smelled like pine all out of the package. I’m unsure what that’s about but otherwise satisfied."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Get larger size,5,"Normally I wear a large size, however I initially ordered an XL size.  Had to return as it was a little tight.  Ended up getting the 2X.  (Arms were a tad long but, the jacket fit better across the shoulders and chest).  Will keep the 2X jacket.  PS.  I really like the jacket."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Perfect!,5,"Great quality. Perfect in almost all weather.If you're looking for a nice quality, water resistant and stylish bomber to add to your wardrobe I absolutely recommend buying.It goes with almost every fit I put together."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Great value,5,I love this jacket for spring and fall type weather. It's not too heavy that you sweat on those days where it's just a bit chilly. Nice fashionable look. The zippers are nice and heavy duty and bring a nice pop of silver to the jacket.
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Great - especially for the price,5,"This is a lightweight jacket that is great quality. I am 6'0 and 174. Perfect Large fit, even the sleeve length. Have no complaints. This was a super buy."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Lightweight and comfortable,5,"I usually wear a L in jackets but glad I sized up to an XL. It is comfortable but definitely just a windbreaker, not especially warm, but does the job in mild weather."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Size up and you’ll be loving it!,5,"Definitely order a size up! My boyfriend wears medium shirts and I told i him to get a large jacket, which he did. And the large fits perfectly! He loves this jacket :) not heavy and thick (which he hates) it’s more of windbreaker material, great to wear over a T-shirt or long sleeve on a chilly day"
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Great Light Jacket,5,"The fit is great and I've gotten many compliments about the jacket.  The jacket is light and is meant to be worn on top of whatever your wearing.  It helps keep you warm and is water-resistant, but this not a sweatshirt (in terms of warmth) nor is it a raincoat (in terms of water-repellant).  I love it though."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Great jacket .,4,"I liked this jacket ,but will be returning it because it is a little small for me , its not as warm as i needed. If it would have fit I probably would have kept it tho."

TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Don’t waste your time or money...,1,"I was really looking forward to having this bomber jacket for those cool, breezy summer evenings. I am very disappointed with the product I received. I ordered a size larger than I needed, and it still is way too small. Jacket is cheaply made and is loud (swishing sound when you even think of moving your arm(s)). Will be returning and ordering a different brand."

Great purchase!"

Volcom Men's Brighton Pullover Anarok Hooded Snowboard Jacket,Fits well,5,I got the medium. I’m 5’6” - 5’7” 190lb athletic build and it fits well. My chest is about 40-42”. My shoulders are about 20-21”. I ended up getting the Volcom overalls to match. Next year will be a great time to use this gear. Can’t wait.
Volcom Men's Brighton Pullover Anarok Hooded Snowboard Jacket,Plastic jacket,1,Item is made of plastic and does not say anything about it in listing. Not getting the rough edges and stiffness with this material. Not sure about the warmth and breath ability of a goretex shell I was looking for
Volcom Men's Brighton Pullover Anarok Hooded Snowboard Jacket,Great jacket for snowboarding.,5,"Bought this for my son. He is a 6’3” snowboarder. He loves the length of this jacket to cover his behind when strapping into his snowboard. Loves all the pockets and that it is a thin,  but warm, windbreaker. We bought him a sz L."
Volcom Men's Brighton Pullover Anarok Hooded Snowboard Jacket,Bibs zip/connect to jacket to prevent snow and wind intrusions.,5,Great jacket and bib set for skiing and other outdoor activities.
Volcom Men's Brighton Pullover Anarok Hooded Snowboard Jacket,great buy,5,great buy
Volcom Men's Brighton Pullover Anarok Hooded Snowboard Jacket,Comfortable and fit,5,I bought this for my grandson at first I was like it’s a lot of money but it’s worth every penny.. light weight and very warm
Volcom Men's Brighton Pullover Anarok Hooded Snowboard Jacket,"Great fit, feel, and function, all while looking cool enough to steal.",5,"I'm an east coast snowboard instructor of four years and bought this in November 2019 as my personal jacket for the winter season.I bought a medium and it fits well as a 6' slim guy, and I never had a problem with rain or water coming through. Brest pockets are well supported and the hoodie pocket is lined. Storage is different compared to a normal style jacket and there are less pockets, but the pockets you do get are large and work great. You can fit 7 PBR's comfortably, maybe 9 if you push it but I wouldn't ride in it that way. The hood has a lot of adjustment features that are a nice touch. Fully expanded accommodates a helmet just fine, and cinching the rear tightens it down for regular use well.The only downsides of this jacket come from the pull over side zip design. Your jacket has to go on before the helmet and vice versa. It only really has one vent at the left armpit. The right side is a double zipper that extends from the hem up past the armpit. I would keep it open like a vent most of the time and use the other zipper for opening and closing the jacket. Overall it's a solid wind and water shell that doesn't break the bank.My multi color variant looked awesome performed well with no real complaints for about 2/3 of the season. I got many compliments on the look of the jacket, it was quite popular. So popular in fact that a couple dudes decided to steal it. Feels bad man."
Volcom Men's Brighton Pullover Anarok Hooded Snowboard Jacket,Quality Jacket,4,"Very warm, cool features. Love the kangaroo pocket. The hood is actually sized so you can wear it over your helmet. There are clips built into the hood that attach to your helmet too, so when you turn your head, the hood turns with you. Couple things I’d like this jacket to have (that it doesn’t):Wrist gaiters. My last few jackets have had them and I took them for granted.I wish the side zipper had a more substantial pull. It’s fine when you don’t have gloves on, but impossible to grab with a gloved hand. I bought some extenders, designed for people with poor dexterity, that work like a champ.The side zipper isn’t vented at all. You can open the vent on your right, but on the left side the zipper just opens to the world."
Volcom Men's Brighton Pullover Anarok Hooded Snowboard Jacket,,0,"Great coat, its nice and long like a ski coat should, fit a hoodie under no problem! Only complaint is im in canada, when we ski it can be down to -20 down to -30 and it just isint too warm, i need to have layers underneath to stay warm this coat is more or a windbreaker with some warmness... i love the look and its really comfy but yeah was hoping it would be warmer"
Volcom Men's Brighton Pullover Anarok Hooded Snowboard Jacket,,0,"Le produit était mal emballé, avec de mauvaises coutures et certaines parties du tissu étaient abîmées (notamment la capuche)Le service client a été encore pire..."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Love it,5,I love that it’s just like the picture
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Expected better quality,1,Ordered this April 29th only worn maybe 7x I look down today and see this
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Ookay,3,"So it serves the purpose of a rain jacket very well, but it doesn't come with the ""fake"" champion logo on the front, so it really just looks like a high quality shopping bag. To answer any questions anyone may have, yes this is fake. Personally I think there's cuter raincoats out there, but it's okay still."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Great Product,5,"I bought my husband a 2X. It is an official champion product. Their website was sold out, so I was pleased to find one on Amazon. My husband is 6 feet tall and has large shoulders and arms. The jacket fell right by his belt. I thought it would be a concern, but it looks really nice on him."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Great and Versatile,5,"Was a Christmas gift for my son, who is very picky with clothing (teenager) and he loved it. Was exactly what I expected. Great quality."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Not as pictured,3,The jacket wasn’t the same as the one pictured. The one in the pic has the champion logo on the chest as well and mine only had one on the sleeve. Kind of annoying. Otherwise looks fine.
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,sent it back and had to pay return shipping!,2,This was suppose to be a 2X Mans. I buy 2X clothes all the time a normal large is tight on me this was even tighter than that. I don't know if this was miss marked or what I could just verily smash myself into it I am very disappointed. I own many Hanes tie shirts and sweat shirts that are 2X no problems that is why I  think this might be missed marked. I don't feel like I want to go through this again without trying it on before buying. You have to pay return shipping on this so don't buy this unless you are sure that is will fit and this is a retailor apart from amazon so this cost me something like 9 dollars to try this on.
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Not really sure what to think,3,"Ive worn one wind breaker before and if fit lose and stopped all the wind. This one the fit is to snug when trying to put it on, but once its on i guess its decent...wonder how a bigger size would fit.  This material transfers the cold if you try to lean on something, and also doesn't stop all the wind. Again not to sure what to think as i really don't need a jacket just bought it for when i run when its a little colder outside. But i think hoodies work better."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Little big but works and feels great,5,"I love this style windbreaker, bought one for my brother as a gift and liked how it looked and felt so i bought one for myself, definitely will need some tailoring for much slimmer people like myself. Jacket length is good, it’s right under my belt, fit at chest is very loose. the product overall fits loose but i will be wearing a sweater under it anyways so it’s not a big deal. overall great product, i would recommend but like i said will probably need some tailoring for slimmer people."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,A convenient jacket.,5,"Purchased this product from a different company and color some months ago. Fits great. Very light, comfortable to wear on nice days. Having a large front pouch pocket is convenient for carrying around keys, wallets, hand sanitizer and facial coverings. Wind resistant and easy to wash. I recommend hang drying in order to keep it looking nice."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Perfect.,5,"Was looking for a ""windbreaker/ shell"" for hiking, walking etc. This jacket is perfect! Well made. Front sweatshirt style pocket. It really does blunt wind and is water resistant. Best deal at this price point. And, most definitely seems authentic."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,AMAZING AUTHENTIC PRODUCT,5,I really love this jacket especially because of all the cool features like the zipper pocket and the champion script logo.
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Nice!,5,"I took a chance an am so happy I did! I'm a very busty lady triple D to be exact. Most coats never fit right because of this. I ordered the teal pullover jacket in a men's XL. It has adjustable waist strap an hood strap. It also folds into its own front pocket. So it's easy to put in my purse an travel with. Though the teal was more of a blue, I'm ok with that! In fact I love it even more. It also shipped fast. Thx so much."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Just what I needed in a wind-breaker,5,"This golden yellow jacket is light, water-resisitant, colorful and convenient (folds up into its own pocket and even has a hood. In other words...it is perfect."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,"Durable Material ,true to size!",5,"This was a gift for my son and exceeded my expectations ! Great and durable material ,Well made! My son is a large,did not want it to be too fitted so I went up a size . This is true to size .So if you are a Large get a large and so on . Great buy my son loves it !!"
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Must have for your sport activities,5,Love this pullover zip hooded jacket.  Fits as expected this is the second one I owned.  Very comfortable during my work out.  I plan on purchasing 2 more for my collection the red and possibly the yellow one as well.
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Cheap looking and shortish,1,"Too short on arms and length for my 6’4 son. Most medium clothes fit him, but not this one. Plastic, boxy and cheap looking. I guess you get what you pay for."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,The Perfect Wind breaker,5,"Great for hiking, walking, running in wind and rain.  If it's cold you will need some layering but it's the perfect external top."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Good,5,Fits well.  True to size.  Not baggy but enough space to accommodate a couple of layers.  Definitely recommending this to family and friends.
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,fits nice and warm in these cold florida winters.,4,"colors are visable for sure.  wish it had a full zipper. but very nice. took some time in transit getting here, but again amazon comes through. thanks"
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Careful  of the shoulder line,4,"I bought large and fit runs a little big. The shoulder part of the jacket does not match shoulder line, so be careful of that. Otherwise it is great for the price"
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Great Windbreaker. Size Up,5,"Fantastic windbreaker. I'm 5' 9"" (69 in.) tall, 165 lbs. and ordered a large. I usually always wear medium shirts. I always size up on hoodies/sweaters and this was no exception. If you order a medium, it will be a bit short in length at the back. The windbreaker also has a tab you can pull by the waist to tighten it as you see fit."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Brother in-law loved it,5,"He didn't actually say he loved it, but he loves everything we buy him. He's just a nice guy."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Very comfortable & durable,5,I got this for work because I go in and out of my building and it is very comfortable and durable. I am considering getting another one for home.
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Nice windbreaker on the small side,4,"I am 5' 7"" 162 and bought a medium.  it just barely fits with a tee shirt underneath.  If you plan on layering but the next size up.  Other than being slightly small it is a nice quality windbreaker."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Disappointing.,2,"I bought this as a gift, and when I received it, it was practically see-through. Definitely a Men's clothing item, as there's absolutely no wiggle room in the chest area. You're paying for the logo, not quality."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Narrow Hem! Not great for wide frames,2,"Everything was great and it fitted as expected EXCEPT FOR THE WAIST! The hem has no give and if you have a wide frame like i do, forget it! I wanted something that hung over my hips and this just fit snug and tight."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Bonito diseño pero mangas cortas e incomodas...,3,"En general me gustó, el diseño y la tela, pero las mangas vienen muy cortas y al tener un caucho muy apretado son incomodas, la usé solo 2 veces y la regalé"
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,"Small waist, see through, incorrect item received",2,The cuffs around the wrist are stretchy but the one around the waist I’m not. So there is no give in the waist. It is a little fitting around the waist but big everywhere else. So I can’t size up to fix that issue. Slight see through as well. I didn’t receive the one in the picture either. So don’t recommend
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,It's ok,3,"Looks good. Fits well except the sleeves run a bit small. To a point point that I feel I am constantly tugging on them as if they are a ""capri"" version of a jacket."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,fake,3,"this is fake. color is pretty nice, the material not so much. VERY lightweight and runs a little large."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,so small,1,feels very cheap and runs a full size small
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,They run small,5,I think they run small because my boyfriend is usually a size medium in tops and jackets but he could barely put it over his body so now it’s mine. He’s 6ft skinny but very muscular
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Good product,5,Good product. Bought blue and black and they are awesooooome
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Fits great,5,"I wear somewhere between a size large, and an extra large t-shirt. So the size large jacket fits perfectly! However it's not too big, and loose, so I think an extra large would have fit okay too."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Good purchase,5,Good buy and fit as expected
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Good,5,This jacket is really nice. It has a lot of pockets. You could fit your Nintendo switch in the big zipper pocket.
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Champion,5,Light weight and comfortable
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Size up one !,4,Ok so overall I really like it. I’m a female I ordered a size Large in hopes it would be a little oversized. It fits perfectly like a women’s Large and a men’s Medium. I had my boyfriend who wears a size Large try it on and it was a tad tight on the arms. For sure if you’re a MENS LARGE SIZE UP!
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Great Packable Jacket,4,"Got these for my pre-teens to keep in their book bags. They love them, great fit."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Great waterproof jacket,5,This jacket works well as a waterproof jacket and feels relatively nice quality. It looks nice and very lightweight.
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Buena,5,Good
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Great jacket,5,This a very nice light weight jacket and very stylish.I had bought this same jacket at another sports store for twice the price.Glad I checked on Amazon.
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Not the worst not the best,4,"Strange fit, ordered L and XL and the length on both sizes is pretty much the same but XL is just wider in arms, also the jacket could easily afford being a little longer. Otherwise it's a good quality, easily packable in its small pocket and super compact"
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Very Bad Material. Too Tight. Do Not Buy!,2,Very Bad Material. The Zips Broke Off Overtime When Laundering It And The Wrist Band Is Way Too Tight So I Do Not Recommend This Clothing.

Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Medium fits like a medium,4,"Not too wide. Fits like a medium should. Not too thick, perfect jacket for rainy weather"
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Painfully thin,3,You’re paying for what you get with this one. It’s see through from how thin it is. Definitely don’t recommend unless you want something to cover a stain. But then again it’s still so thin it’ll probably be seen though it
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Great!,5,"My son loved this slicker.  We very happy to receive it Christmas morning.  Fit great, looks great."

MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Best coat ive owned,5,"This coat is amazing. It completely blocks the wind and rain. The coat is also very warm and fits perfect. I am 5'-9"" and 160lbs and it fits good with room for layers underneath if neededThe only negative i can think of is that the zippers seem a little cheap but so far they are holding up great.I was on the top of the Alps last week with just this coat, a long sleeve and a short sleave during a blizzard and was good to go"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Better quality than Expected!,5,"Fits perfectly. As soon as I stepped out some one assumed it was a very expensive jacket. It keeps me extremely warm. The hood feels good on my head, it's removable and has a high quality velcro type strap plus strings. Pockets are accessible and convenient. It's not too big at all and is flexible with how you need to move about. so far so good."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great jacket for cold & wet weather,5,"I bought this for my husband. He delivers gas for a living and in the winter it gets cold and wet. This jacket was perfect considering it was waterproof and warm, not to mention decently priced. He immediately tested its claim of being water proof. He put it on and stood in the shower. Definitely worth the money lmao"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Get Fit and Function !,5,"I live in Houston where it can be very difficult to find a jacket, I went on lineand got lucky - this jacket deserves all the good reviews, it fits me like aglove ( Large size, I am 6 foot ! 165 lbs, long arms)  Lots of pockets,feels very cozy, I could not be any more pleased..  Thanks !"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Well Done!,5,"Reviews for quality and size are accurate. I'm 5'9"" 175lbs and the large was very big on me even with a hoodie underneath. The medium fits perfect. I've only had it for a week and the quality is great so far. I got a compliment on the very first day."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Wind Warrior,5,"This coat has been a great tool for fighting winter weather in the Pacific Northwest. Freezing rain, fog, and snow don't stand a chance. I got this coat to be able to ride an ATV to plow snow and found it to be warm, comfortable, and easy to move in. It also provides a solid windproof barrier that I could tell was much better than my old parka. I can easily ride in freezing temperatures for hours at up to 30 mph - no problem.I got the ""Army Green"" and it seemed to be more like a split-pea green so I'll probably get another one in black and use it for the wet, dirty outdoor chores. Overall, very impressed. I'm 5'10"" and 150 lbs., so lean and mean but no problem with the fit. Sleeves might be a bit tight on popeye but there's plenty of room for you barrel-chested or beer-belly champions out there.The only thing that was a bit of a drawback was the hood, which runs a little small. Nothing a normal ballcap can't fill-in. Also, the zipper is a right-hand closure, so it might have been a mistake in the sewing process. I'd like to have had insulated pockets but they serve their purpose. Will definitely buy another one soon."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"So I read a review that said this coat is for large people, they were right",4,"Brooklyn Review: I bought this coat because someone had written in their review that they were dissatisfied because this was  a coat for ""fat people."" I know I should have been outraged, but instead I realized that this was the coat for me. I have owned the coat for a few months now and it is wicked hot. The outer shell keeps out the rain and the cold. The light fleece on the inside makes me sweat. The price was worth it.So why not 5 stars?The problem is that the zippers are cheaply made. They look cool, but easily get jammed and fall off their track. I had to make a small stitch at the beginning and end of each pocket to prevent the zipper from falling off the track on all the pockets. Also, the fleece on the inside of my jacket had a section where the stitching came undone and I had to patch it up. Nothing crazy, but when you buy something new you don't expect to have to do some tailoring. The hood although still usable seems to run a little small, almost like it is out of proportion with the overall jacket.However, if the company can correct these three issues with a little more quality control and design checks this coat could easily sell for more and be a big hit. To the designer consider creating a female companion to this coat, but check the measurements for your intended consumer target."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Almost perfect,3,"I purchase 3 of these jackets, two for men (medium black camo, 2XL army green) and one for women (large black). Overall it is a good jacket but lacks one fundamental feature required to maintain body heat, a draw cord hem, without it, the body insulation that a good mountain snow jacket is supposed to provide, is gone. As simple as it sounds, sports such as downhill skiing, and snowboarding, expose the body to consistent winds, the body must remain insulated all the way around (cuffs, hem, neck, and face). These are the advantages, disadvantages, and other details of this garment.PROS:- The outer shell is relatively thick, the fabric feels sturdy and capable of handling abrasion.- The inner lining is very soft and comfortable, it is not as bulky as the Sherpa lining found in other Sherpa jackets but good enough.- The fibers of the inner lining are approximately 4mm long and allow reasonable airflow.- The inner lining of the hood fees comfortable, the hood provides a drawcord.- The cuffs can be adjusted to the wrist with velcros.- The men's medium size is true and it matches the dimensions provided by the manufacturer.- The women's large size is true and it matches the dimensions provided by the manufacturer.CONS:- The lack of a draw cord hem is a critical failure.- The zipper flap along the jacket should have snaps or velcros to prevent it from flapping around while under windy conditions, it has just two metal snaps, one close to the neck and one at the bottom of the hem.- The manufacturer does not specify, but the jacket appears to be 10000mm waterproof. 10K is enough to handle light to average rain for a short amount of time. Ratings between 10K and 15K can handle a moderate amount of rain for much longer, and jackets rated between 15K and 20K or higher are serious shells for heavy, intense rain over a prolonged period. This jacket will handle light rain but it is not a rain jacket.- The jacket is too stiff for rock climbing or cycling as advertised by the manufacturer.RECOMMENDATION:Other than the draw cord hem, it is a good jacket, but those that are looking to wear it for its advertised purpose (sports such as downhill skiing, and snowboarding) will find the draw cord to be a deal breaker, but if you don’t mind it or you can have one installed, then, it is a good product. In my case, I returned them because I plan on wearing them for sports activities under very windy conditions. There are similar products from different brands that include this detail."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Excellent,5,"Very impressed with the jacket. It came in two days of shipping and the packaging was very good. It’s light weight and surprisingly warm. I had my doubts, but so far it’s been a great jacket. We just got dumped on with a bunch of snow and I wore it with just my t-shirt underneath the jacket shoveling snow and it kept me warm. It was 25 degrees out by the way. But if you were not going to do any activities in it, I’d would wear a hoodie underneath it. Just for extra warmth. The sizing is right. I’m 5’6 and 170 pounds and the large fits really good with extra room for a hoodie comfortably. I washed it as soon as I got it. I washed it in cold water and dried it on low heat and it passed the test with no issues. It’s actually waterproof. Snow and rain didn’t penetrate the jacket at all. You can’t beat the price. I’m a very picky coat person and I do a lot of research before purchasing anything. I’m glad I went with this jacket. Overall, I’m just impressed with this jacket and would recommend it. Hope this helps."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Far exceeded expectations!,5,"Here are some details on this jacket's features, in order of importance.FIT: I am 5'7"", 143 lbs and usually order a men's ""small."" That's what I ordered and it fit me perfectly. It's roomy enough to layer a sweatshirt or heavy sweater underneath. My arms have a good range of motion in this jacket; it's not tight anywhere. It's longer than a bomber but not as long as a parka.WARMTH: This is an extremely warm, comfortable jacket. The pile (faux fur) lining is very effective. I've worn it in 25 degree weather so far, with a sweatshirt underneath and felt very snug. It has a zip-through collar that hugs your throat, keeping it protected.WATERPROOF: On two days when I walked my dog, it started raining. This jacket sheds water remarkably well. The rain just beaded up on the shell and ran off. I was very pleased with the rain protection quality.WINDPROOF:  The polyester fabric does an excellent job of blocking the wind. On cold, windy days, the wind chill didn't affect me at all.HOOD: A warm hood is a MUST here in the Midwest. This one features the same, ultra-warm pile lining as the jacket. We like to wear a stocking cap under the hood for complete warmth. This hood is plenty roomy for my thickest stocking cap. It has a hook-and-loop fastener 3/4"" wide by 2"" long. I don't know how this will hold up over time. It may be a bit skimpy. The hood has push-button toggles to tighten the string and hold it in place, much preferable to trying to tie a drawstring in cold weather. The hood zips off, if you want to remove it.POCKETS: The two outside, bottom pockets have zippers. I don't know if that's necessary, but some folks may like them. I wear thick, insulated gloves and they easily fit in these deep pockets. The outside, left breast pocket measures 3.5"" wide by 7"" deep and is zippered. The inside pocket is 5.5"" wide by 7"" deep and zippered.CUFF CLOSURES: Each cuff has an exterior hook-and-loop closure to tighten the end of the sleeve. I haven't adjusted these because there's also some elastic inside the cuffs that keeps them tight around your wrist so wind doesn't blow in.DETAILS: On the outer right breast of the jacket is embroidered lettering that says: ""V.A. TOR 189  UNCO & BOROR"" with an embroidered logo. I have no idea what any of that means, but frankly, I don't care. This jacket is so warm and comfortable that I'm willing to overlook this mystery.OVERALL IMPRESSION: A completely superior product that far exceeded my expectations. If the nylon zipper holds up (and I have no reason to believe it won't; it works smoothly), I expect many years of good service from this jacket. Well, well worth the money."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Ugly nonsense logos,2,I know I saw them in the pictures but the nonsense logos are brighter and more prominent than expected (especially on flat gray coat).  This looks like something you win in a raffle at work if you worked for VATOR 189 UNCO AND BOROR... whatever that means.  It's otherwise a nice coat for the price. I just can't wear this around for the next several years.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great jacket for the price!,4,"I think this jacket is a great deal, I don’t have any major complaints so far. Some other reviews talked about the zippers - and I’m not sure yet, but they seem fine. They do have a feel of not being the most sturdy, you can tell by how loosely they zip. But I took this jacket skiing and it held up nicely.They also seem to have fixed the zipper side (saw some reviews saying the zipper was on the wrong side); it’s correct on this jacket so I don’t know.It’s comfortable and the fleece inside is a really nice touch. My favorite part is the detachable hood, which I took off for skiing. The jacket also fits pretty true to size, wish it was maybe an inch or so longer but it’s not enough for me to exchange for a larger size - which I think would just make the jacket way wider and not much longer.Overall I’m happy with the purchase, especially considering the price. Most ski jackets are $250+, so this quality seems well above its price."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,This is not a great warm jacket!,4,"The quality of this jacket is very good, but, I do have an important However! After reading several reviews on Amazon, I got the impression that this jacket would be a warm winter jacket and was intended for stuff like snowboarding or skiing! That's what people were saying, Right? I live in South Eastern Arizona where it can dip into the 20's. Trust Me, This is NOT that warm of jacket. The 1st time I used it it was a Balmy 33 degrees and just to be safe I wore a long sleeved Tshirt with a sweatshirt and was very glad that I ""Layered"" because I could easily feel the cold breeze/wind,  in the sleeves especially, but the body of the jacket needed a bit of a boost as well. I added a light hoodie to the layers and it is good enough to be comfortable with 24 degrees and a light breeze. I needed a good middle weight jacket so this is a keeper, but I for sure would not wear something like this to ski with."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Good, warm jacket for the price.",5,"Good product for the price. Like other reviewers have commented, the main zipper is on the left-hand side, and all of the zippers feel sort of low quality, but if you're deliberate with your zipping there won't be a problem. Fleece lined. Warm. One complaint is that the Velcro closures on the wrists will scratch your hands something fierce if they aren't aligned properly. But, for the price, I'm not going to use any exclamation points or capital letters about it. Used as an outer layer in 0-5 degrees F. The lettering/branding on the jacket doesn't make any sense, but when people have asked about it I just act like I'm in a secret club and told them not to ask questions they don't want the answer to."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great value with a couple downsides,4,"This jacket is a great value.  The price is excellent.  It fits well.  It comes down past your waste which is what i want.  It is extremely comfortable.  Also has kept me plenty warm in temps in the 20s.There are two negatives which keep it from 5 star.  One is the zipper which is flipped sides from American zippers.  Not a true killer.But the the other is that there is no liner for warmth in the hand pockets, which is a big downside if you want ti keep your hands warm.  Its just the thin outer layer with nothing inside.  This is truly the only big negative about this jacket."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Nice aside from obnoxious branding,2,"Returned in 3 seconds. Got the blk/grey camo and it was almost perfect. My complaint is the obnoxious 5 different logo locations (fonts, sleeves, hood all have this no-name brand logo stitched in bright gold). Even if it were some meaningful label or brand name, i wouldnt expect it on a camo jacket in bright colors. Probanly even an attempt to rebrand as it doesnt match its own inside labels. Otherwise very warm and goog looking."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Major Zipper Malfunction,2,"We bought this jacket for my big 12-year old son to ski in North Carolina over Christmas.  He loved the look and fit of the jacket (though the lettering was a bit large for my taste, but he didn’t care), and he was warm, comfortable and dry when he skied and even played in the snow.  Unfortunately on the 2nd day the zippers started breaking, and by the 4th day of our ski trip, 3 of the 4 zippers were broken.  At one point my son didn’t realize when he zipped his pocket shut with his iPhone in it, it didn’t actually zip as the zipper had broken and was no longer connecting to the other side leaving a wide open pocket.  My son’s phone fell out of his open pocket on the ski lift resulting in about an hour of chaos in trying to find the phone. The zippers are simply too cheap, small and lightweight for a winter jacket, especially one marketed as a ski jacket when you know pockets with zippers are going to be used for gloves, cell phones, wallets, ski passes, etc.  We fully intended to use this jacket for another ski trip but we will unfortunately be returning it. If you’re not going to use the zippers much, this jacket will definitely keep you warm and dry."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,EXCELLENT Winter Jacket,5,"I went out on a limb and purchased this jacket for a snowboarding trip to the Canadian Rockies. With temperatures expected to be in the low teens / mid -twenties all week long, I was needing something extremely warm and super comfortable. This jacket fit the bill PERFECTLY! I only wore a base layer under it and I found myself sweating a times while on the slopes or walking around downtown. It held up well under the wet, snowy conditions and has plenty of pockets for all of my stuff. I did find that the fit was a tiny bit larger than expected, but for me it was perfect since I want my ski jackets to have plenty of room. Normally I wear a L but ordered and XL just to be safe. Yes, the zipper is on the wrong side and one of the logos looked a little faded, but who cares?! Its stylish, waterproof, SUPER warm, and less expensive than any jacket of equal stature. Im tempted to buy another one just to have as a backup. If you're in the market for a solid jacket, look no further."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great Jacket,4,"Got this for my husband, he’s 5’10 180lb he usually wears XL T-shirt’s cause he likes loose clothes, reading the reviews most of the people were saying size down so we got an L.The length of the jacket was perfect, fitting good, but sleeves were short and back felt tight, so we returned the L and got an XL instead, which fits better although it’s kinda long, but if you don’t mind having a longer jacket everything else is perfect.The quality looks really good, all the zippers sturdy, great pockets and the hidden one in the chest is perfect for phone or wallet.We tried it at 30 degrees Fahrenheit just jacket and T-shirt and warms perfect, we haven’t tried colder temps or in the snow but the jacket is pretty warm by itselfSize very tricky I recommend you get your regular size and one size down to fit both options and decide, good thing you have the option of free returns."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Tear out of the box,1,"Coat is very warm and fit perfectly, but unfortunately it had a tear in the front left pocket exposing the inner liner.  Very disappointed in this.  Hope the replacement one is better.Update, received the replacement and it is in much better shape.  Very waterproof, water just runs right off.  So we will see how it does on the mountains skiing.  Also the replacement came very fast!!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Fantastic Winter Coat,4,"Had to give 4 Stars. They lost a Star because of the Zippers. I had one zipper failure during my trip to the Rocky Mountains. It was the main torso zipper. It just opened right up, on it's own at the ribcage. I wasn't zipping it and it wasn't a tight fit. Just looked down and it was opened about 4 inches. This was my only winter coat that I brought with me on the trip so I got panicked. But I slowly worked the zipper up and down until it sealed back up. There was not another occurrence of zipper failure, but I used all of the zippers very gently since then.Now on to the coat itself. I used this coat with a few base layers in the Rocky Mountains in the snow and wind in as low as 19 degrees F for a week. I never felt the cold even once. In fact, sitting around the fire, I had to take it off a few times because I was overheating. It's incredibly warm and roomy. Im 5'11"" 235lbs somewhat big guy, plenty of muscle and just as much fat. Got the XXL. It is a perfect fit. Actually has lots of extra room. I can wear a hoody or 3 to 4 base layers under it and still have room to move. The arms are another great surprise. My Coats always have short arms. I hate that. Not with this coat. Even with arms extended, the sleeves still cover my gloves.All in all, a great purchase. I'll be buying a backup of this same coat. Worth every penny."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"This is Not a Cold Weather Coat, sleeves hav No Extra Lining, Way 2Long in XL. 4 Cost Not .better",1,"Very Disappointed, been looking for a couple of month for a Decent price Heavy Winter Jacket. Looked at Wal-Mart n Kohls, found a few decent ones but not Heavy, thin lining. Found about 4on Amazon, all made in china, all made n looks the same. I figured a Ski Jacket would do Great here in MI. I wear XL coats, jackets, sweatshirts. So it came within a few days, opened n tried on, right away the sleeves go way past my hands, then I went outside to try it, about 18f out. Arms got cold, No Extra Lining at all in arms. Jacket Looks Nice, and really wanted to like it, but for the cost it's no warmer n thicker than my 3/4 Carhart I've had 4sev yrs. Will hav to keep looking, next time I'll try a Large. Amazon has some others about $100, that may b my only option. Would not recommend 4a Cold Weather jacket."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Runs extremely large,3,"Seems decent quality for the price however as many have said it runs extremely large. I’m 6’3” and 195 pounds with an athletic build. Due to my height and arm length I’m normally on the high end of a large, ordered this as a large and it was extremely to big. Had to exchange for a medium to get a decent fit. Order at least one size smaller than you’d normally wear but may need to go down even more."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Caution - Sellers with Different Names,2,"I'm 185 lbs and 5'11. I ordered a large and it was way too big. I sent it back and got the medium which fit much better but the weird thing is that it just felt like the sleeves were different. My jacket overall is still too large and makes you feel like the Michelin Man. I wish it was slimmer so I didn't look like a marshmallow while trying to ski. It also looked WAY less cool in person due to the puffiness (which, I should add, is not caused by tons of insulation... it just leaves room for a giant beer belly).Durability is questionable at best. It survived 2 days of a North Carolina ski trip before the zipper broke on one of the pockets.One very curious thing I noticed is that TONS of these cheap winter coats on Amazon are from the same manufacturer. You'll see many different brands listed with different rating averages. I mean pages and pages of this. But then if you look closely you'll notice some are the identical jacket (same patterns) while others are identical with the same patch on the inside but the patterns are just different on the outside. You can also notice the pictures are identical in the way they display the jacket but it looks different just due to colors not available from the ""other"" seller. I mention this so you can hopefully avoid not liking how this fits and then accidentally ordering the exact same cut from another brand which isn't actually another brand.TLDR: Warm enough for skiing, decent value, but if you don't have a big stomach then it's gonna fit too loose"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"AWESOME coat, beware of Velcro",4,"This coat is absolutely amazing! It holds up to the bone-freezing wind tunnel of downtown Boston. It repels rain and water like nobody’s business. If I want a good sweat, I’ll wear a sweater under it - that’s how much you won’t need one! I wish it were longer for even more commute protection, but I get that it’s a ski jacket at the end of the day. Seriously, with this coat the cold will never bother you anyway.I would love to give this coat 5 stars, but it does have one major risk - the Velcro around the cuffs. Don’t let this hold you back from making an awesome purchase, but do be safe with the arms on this coat. I wouldn’t recommend wearing it to caress a loved one’s cheek. I wouldn’t recommend wearing it while adjusting a sweater underneath. I wouldn’t recommend wearing it if you’re sitting down to use the bathroom (no matter how quick you think you’ll be - take it off). This Velcro thinks it’s competing with Jaws - and it’s no paper cut."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Looks good but is cheap. Don't buy!!,1,Jacket looks nice however it does not breathe well at all. Had for less than a month and the pocket zipper would not open. Had to force it open leading to the zipper breaking. Return window was up yesterday so now I'm stuck with this broken junk. Also zipper is on the left side for the main jacket entrance. ???? Why
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Exceptional,5,"Water proof - was the primary reason for buying.  Its hard to find a good waterproof coat/jacket that doesn't feel like a plastic shell and under a hundred bucks in a variety of colors.I'm 6'3"", 205lbs, 43 inch chest with a 17.5 neck, 34 in waist and 35 inch sleeves. (Metric 193.5cm tall and 92.98 kilos)I ordered two; one in large and an extra large because the cut/sizing is almost never spot on from brand to brand.This large was restricting in the shoulders, right on in arm length; with the chest and waist loose yet comfortably close (about an inch of play).In all I had to go to the XLarge, because of the shoulder fit.I kept the large, which is actually to big for my wife, but she is in a wheel chair and loves the extra room and ease of getting on. (Green is her color)."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Warmer than it looks,5,"I ordered an extra large because I like to wear layers. After wearing it for a few days, I probably could have gotten a large. Even wearing both a sweater and a sweatshirt as layers, it is still a bit loose/baggy. That's fine. I'd rather have the extra space than not. I think that having a coat that is smaller, you warm up to the point of sweating. So this looseness is more breathable.The color is bright. I do a lot of walking (as I don't have a car for the moment), and other vehicles can see me better from a distance.As a joke to myself...I sometimes think that I must look like a walking wet floor cone sign...minus the words. Especially when I have the hood on.When I first wore it, I didn't think that it would keep me warm enough, so I wore both a sweater and a sweatshirt on top of two shirts. Within minutes I was boiling! This coat is deceptively warmer than it looks!All of the pockets have zippers and are deep. Except for one. The outside front chest pocket is average. The two front hand pockets are nice and deep and so is the inside chest pocket."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Not a Cabela's product... but....,5,"I am really impressed by the quality and warmth of this PARKA (longer body length than a jacket). The arms are a little too long for my size (Large), but that means I can retract my hands on a cold, windy day and keep my fingers from getting numb. The body length is also longer - beyond waist length, which I like but a skier may not desire. I am thinking of buying a second parka.EARLIER REVIEW:At first I thought that this parka would not work for me. I recently moved from No. Calif. to Vancouver, Washington, and it rains a lot more here, plus can drop some wet (coastal or Spring-type) snow occasionally. It's not the warmth nor protection of a too-small Cabela's parka that I own, but that one cost over $150.!As time has gone on, I think I will keep it as a working parka (versus a back-up parka). Even Cabela's rain wear is having quality problems!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Does the job! Only one problem. Cheap zipper pockets..,4,"Does a great job at blocking strong winds and keeping my body warm and insulated while on cell towers. I honestly don’t feel a thing when I’m wearing this coat out in freezing weather! Great product! I’m 5’7 140lbs and a size M fits perfect!  (Update): Only problem I’ve noticed is the zippered pockets. They broke on me and I couldn’t pop the zipper back in and when I try to zip up the right pocket, it doesn’t seal up.. cheaply made materials, but still keeps you warm. 4 Stars"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Finally a lined winter jacket that keeps me warm,5,Love this jacket. I’ve had a “winter” jacket for years but 1 it didn’t have a good hood and 2 the hood had no lining so my head was always cold. This jacket has a very soft and warm lining throughout and inside the hood as well. It’s all one piece as well so no inner “lining” that pulls out when you pull your arms out of the sleeves. Fits perfect. I got a medium and am 5’9 and 160lbs. Snug but can have a sweatshirt under it and still have no issues with it feeling too tight. Have been outside and it’s been 30 degrees. Didn’t feel the wind or the cold come through. Zipper pockets for phones or whatever also are a big plus. Actually bought a second in another color since I loved this one so much.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Zippers are cheaply made and hood is not comfy.,3,"I wish the pocket zipper on one side was not broken.  This jacket is warm, waterproof, great in snow and looks really cool.  However, upon delivery, the pocket zipper broke first time I zipped it.  The seam that would have kept zipper from splitting was sewed wrong on left side.  Other than that, okay jacket.  Hood is awkward, does not have the soft lining of rest of coat, and the part that fastens over face sitting too high.  Cannot wear beanie underneath cause hood too tight.  Front full zipper is sticky, but works so far. Only cause winter is already her am I not returning this jacket.  It would be great if company sent me new one, but so doubt it.  I hope it lasts at least through this season."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Poor Quality Zipper is a Fatal Flaw,3,"The coat is warm and fashionable.  The outer layer is definitely windproof which adds to it warmth.Note: The coat is shipped in a vacuum sealed bag so that, when you first unpacked it, it seems like a lightweight jacket.  However, within a short while, the winter coat returns to its normal size and condition – and you will be pleasantly surprised.Negative: The zipper is sewn on the wrong side of the coat.  The zipper is flimsy and does not unzip all the way down – you must lift the zipper pin up and out of the zipper box to fully release the zipper and open the coat.  The coat will be almost useless when the zipper fails – and it will sooner rather than later.  This poor quality of the zipper is a fatal flaw."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Perfect for moderately cold climates,5,"I have worn this jacket in Tennessee in the fall, and in both South Carolina and Central Florida in the winter. The temperatures ranged from upper 20s to high 50s/low 60s when I wore it in those locations, and the jacket kept me comfortable. Anything lower than the 20s or even the 30s with a high wind and this jacket would not have done its job. for where I live and travel it's perfect. If you live in western New York, Minnesota or similar locations this may get you through the early Fall or late Spring, but is not going to be much help during the dead of Winter.The construction is excellent, and the pockets, zippers and lining are quality. For moderate climates this may be all the winter jacket that you will need. I personally thing the price and features provide good bang for your buck."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Zipper on left side on a mens??? Hum,2,Nice jacket its suppose to be a mens but the zipper is on the left side ... ?????
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Better than I expected it to be but was too big.,5,"I really liked this coat but it was just too big for me so I gifted it to my son as an early Christmas gift. I had ordered the -XL- as I do for much of my clothes because I have long arms and wanted the sleeves to fit but the full body length was too long and baggy. I really wished it had fit better. I'm 6'1"" and 180 lbs. I'm tall and lanky but it was too much for me although the sleeves were perfect. I bought in the Black/White winter camo. My son LOVED the coat and for that....I'm happy with the purchase.  IMO; I really don't like the European zipper which is backwards but its not a detractor to the item. I will order another one again."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Not worth the money,2,"Bought this jacket to wear on a trip to Colorado, but ended up being able to use it a few weeks early in NYC. It does well enough keeping you warm when the weather is around 20/30 but not much cooler than that. And on the second day of wearing it, the pocket zipper broke! Very disappointed with the quality of the jacket. Would not recommend!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,a very good buy,4,"as always i read the reviews, and bought a size smaller.that did the trick, and why i said it fit as expected.i wore it an entire Chicago winter, tho it was not a bad winter;the jacket held its own.i do maint/repair and can spend an hour in the freezer 0 to -10fi will likely buy another just for work.i think it performed well, and for the price; you could outfit your entire staff!oh, plus i liked the name. be safe."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Everything was falling apart,2,"I was looking for a made in the USA coat that would be warm for his infrequent snowboarding adventures 1-2 times a winter. It came with a damaged box even inside. I am still okay with that as long as the jacket is no tear. It is nice color and warm with fleece lined. And that is only good things about it. After the second wear, the Velcro that is stitched on to keep the top flap over the zipper started to come apart. There was no adhesive behind the Velcro. I was going to fit it, but it was not only that. It kept peeling more and more, so the Velcro tab is about to fall off. I would have taken a picture to explain, but I was lazy at that time. Lastly, and most oddly, the zipper zips up on the opposite side and is extremely hard to zipper. Most times it is impossible to zipper and when it appears zippered it breaks apart at the bottom and looks ridiculous. If I am left-handed maybe this would be an easier task but I tried to zip it several times this season when I pulled it out to wear it on a cold day and I can't get it to work. It is pretty much useless now as I can't close it. I was thinking for the price, the quality control should be good. I guess I am wrong, and got a lemon."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Warm, but missing some features for skiing",3,"Not a bad jacket, but not a great one either, at least as far as skiing and snowboarding.  I prefer a longer jacket when skiing and a cinch around the waist.  This jacket only has velcro cinches around the wrists.  It is also missing a hook to hang the jacket?  These are things I'd want in a skiing jacket.  But it does hold up pretty good in the wind\rain\snow when walking the dog...I just get a cold gust of air up the jacket every now and then and wish it had a cinch!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Buy it!,5,"I bought this for my husband because he did not have anything close to a winter jacket. It has far exceeded our expectations. He not only uses it as a winter jacket, but he also uses it as his motorcycle jacket in cold weather. He loves riding his bike, no matter the temp, but as it started getting really cold out it was becoming unbearable. After buying this jacket, nothing stops him now! He stays toasty warm! He can remove the hood so it doesn't interfere with his helmet and it has great pockets to secure his wallet and phone while riding. Not exactly the intended purpose for this coat, but if he can ride a motorcycle in freezing weather and stay warm in this, any man would be more than comfortable in it. Buy it, you'll be happy."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Super Warm,4,"This is the warmest jacket I’ve ever had. It is warmer than the Carhart I own, but does not look nearly as good as it does in the pictures.It’s a little more puffy in real life, and a bit larger than I thought it would be.Though it was the perfect size for someone who might want to wear layers, which is why I didn’t get a smaller size. The pockets are large, except the inside pocket. Really the puffy nature and the inside pocket is what keeps this at a four. This isn’t my most attractive jacket, but that’s not what it’s for and it’s pretty cheap compared to my other jackets that are either meant for extra warmth or to look good."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"snug, but extremely warm",4,"it was a good deal for the money, and surprisingly warm. It's tight/warm enough that if you layer underneath, you might feel suffocated if it's not already winter-cold where you're standing. The hood has a velcro flap that can act like a face protector/scarf which is a nice touch. the interior pocket is essential. My previous jacket was down and extremely comfortable and breathed well, so this was a gamble, but it does the trick and could keep you alive in the northern winter. when temps are in the teens/twenties (F), it keeps me comfortably warm with just a dress shirt underneath. If you add a sweatshirt, it won't be long before you overheat if inside stores or vehicles with heaters. I take it off while driving, but am ultimately glad i made the purchase."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Exceptionally warm and light weight.,4,"Sorry, no photo.  Ordered to replace my ""big box store"" zip to remove liner coat.  I searched 3/4 length winter coat and this caught my attention.  I ordered expecting to have a coat that covered to my knee (I'm 5'6"") and this coat reaches just below my ""hind end"".I'm in Fargo ND and wished to have a coat to combat the sub zero temperatures this area frequently experiences.  As of yet I have not experienced the noted subzero temperatures however in 10 to 20 degree temps this coat is excellent; temperatures above 20 degrees F and this coat is too warm.This is an exceptionally lightweight  winter coat that delivers.  I've hung it in my work locker and it fits with out over filling.  I can not yet  attest to ""sub zero"" temperatures however based on my preliminary ""winter"" temperatures I suspect this coat will combat harsh winter environments; I do wish that the ""3/4"" length I searched reached lower than my ""cheeks""."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Super warm!,5,"Got this as a gift for my partner for Xmas. I was worried it wouldn't be warm enough because it came with a tag on it that said ""fashion jacket,"" lol. He absolutely loves it! He said it's the warmest jacket he's ever had. We live in the Northeast, so that's quite an endorsement. Our winters are frigid. Granted, he isn't going out a whole lot right now because of covid, but every time we do go out he remarks at some point about how warm he is. The sleeves also cinch to keep snow out if you're wearing it while you shovel. The only thing I found a little strange is that the inside lining of the jacket is like a soft sort of faux fur. That's just me though, he doesn't seem to find it weird at all."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Initial impression,3,"As mentioned in many other reviews, go up a size even if your measure fits a certain size to the T. Material seems to be good at delivery, will be testing the quality of the material and stitches in a few week when visiting the Northern US. Zippers and velcros are working fine now.Update:After the initial review, little design flaw starts to show, such as the velcro strap at the end of the cuff will eventually scratch parts of your skin either on the hand or face, since it is placed near the inner of your wrist rather than the outer portion. But everything else seems to have held up pretty good as far as quality and durability goes."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Looking good for less!,5,"Fits great, feels warm, looks good, I'm satisfied!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Not designed well.,1,"There a flap that covers the zipper. There is no Velcro or snaps to keep the flap closed. So it’s always just flying about while you wear the coat. The way that the hood is attached makes it so when you have the hood down, the parts that close the hood together are flapping around like wings. It’s not a good design. This coat also does not have any hook at all. So you will have to just toss it on the floor. You won’t be able to hang it On anything."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Warm and waterproof. Great coat for price!,5,Coat is very warm and waterproof. I got a large thinking it would be a little bigger and it is in arm length but around waist it’s just right with not much room. It runs longer to protect and cover over your butt so it’s a little snug down there. Guess I have a big butt! lol but for the price it is comparable to any other high end ski jacket. I would definitely purchase again. I have received a lot of compliments from wearing it. Has nice color.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Warm, comfortable great every day coat!",4,"The jacket fits great and is true to size, very comfortable. Its pretty warm and washes well.  I don’t know that I would use it for skiing as it doesn’t have an elastic band at the bottom that can be tightened, so some cold air can get in there at times, but it’s still warm enough to wear as an every-day coat.  The only thing that is a bit annoying is that the hood zipper seems to unzip itself over time, so I just have to check it every once in a while.  Over all it’s a great cost for the price."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"He loves it! Finally, a Christmas present that met all the wishes.",5,"My son rides a motorcycle. Enough said. In the winter, staying warm is a challenge because he still has to be able to move (sometimes swiftly). I have bought a number of winter coats for him, but they just haven't worked out.... too tight in the shoulders, too short in the arms. But, Finally!! I saw this on Amazon and decided to try it. After all, Amazon has a great return policy, and we would know within minutes if it would work or not. He wears it nearly every day, now. It is comfortable, keeps the cold wind off and warm enough even to ride the motorcycle at night. We are so happy. Thank you for being generous in your sizing and using quality materials. And, the price was great! Happy 2021 to all!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,I liked the way it fit!,5,I had another jacket that made the same claims as this one. The other jacket was not very warm. This one was warmer but only if you have a sweater or layers underneath. Really warm if you put the hood on and let it store up and retain heat from head on down. I am about 6 foot in height weighing about 220 and the XL size fit me well and roomy enough to layer up underneath it without feeling tight. The Velcro strap on the hood needs to be a little longer so you don't feel like being strangled trying to pull tight enough to fasten it. I can probably fix that with an extra length of Velcro to make it longer.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Super warm, well made, zipper on the other side",5,"Super happy with this purchase. I've been wearing the coat as my everyday coat for a few weeks now. The coat is really well made, fits exactly as expected, and it's plenty warm for the 30 degree weather we've been having. Zero complaints. One weird thing, and other reviews mention it, is that the zipper is on the other side. It doesn't look or fit like a woman's coat. It took a day or two to get used to, but other than that, for the price, i can't recommend this coat enough. I've even gotten several compliments on it."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Careful color will run.,1,"I would have given this item 5 stars because my son loved it and it fit perfectly, but when he took it off it had stained his G-Shock white watch and ruined it.  The manufacturer needs to make it color safe before selling it."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Delivered all it promised!,5,"Bought this coat for a trip to Norway. I’m 6’4” 260lbs xxl fit great! I’m a 37/38 sleeve and these sleeves were plenty long enough. In Norway we got down to the teens and this coat was warm. It also rained and sleeted, the coat kept me warm and dry. The 3/4 length was great and while the coat was bulky it really did all that it promised to do. I was very glad to get it and was thrilled with the performance, especially for the price!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Big Bang for the Buck, but....",4,"As far as value and appearance, this coat is hard to beat.  It’s warm, actually water and wind proof and fairly modern it’s its styling.  You will have to spend more to get a better product.With that said, you get what you pay for.  In this case you probably are getting more.The materials (zippers, outer and inner fabric, etc.) are not as well done as products from other manufactures.  It is unlikely that this jacket would hold up if there were used often for activities beyond walking the dog and going to the car."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Nice coat and warm, but...",2,"I really like this coat. It fits right and looks really nice and seems to be pretty warm. I did have a problem with the coat right out of the packaging. It has a hole on the inside of the pocket that I can fit my fist through to the inner lining. It makes me question the long term quality/reliability of the coat and the rest of the stitching. I'll keep it though because I do like it and don't feel like dealing with the return hassle and reordering. Judging from some of the other reviews, I may just get one with a different problem. It's too bad, because I really like it."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Inexpensive, Warm, and Lightweight",4,"Great lightweight jacket!I purchased the bright green for walking my dog and it is definitely High visibility.There's a nice fleece lining and a removable hood with a velcro neck closure.I'd have given it 5 stars, except for two things; all the zippers are delicate, and the pockets are small/not easy to use.Not work rated by any means."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Definitely would purchase this coat again!,5,"I bought this coat for my son who is 13. He’s around 5’ and 100lbs. The men’s small fits just the way I wanted, a bit bigger for a sweatshirt and snow pants to fit. Plus the sleeves have Velcro around the wrist and a little bit of extra length can easily accommodate mittens. He loves the soft inside and I like the waterproof outside. So far we are both very happy with the coat. It’s probably not heavy enough for the -20F temps during winter, but that’s ok and to no fault of the coat. I would purchase this coat again."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Holes in pockets,3,"Nice coat, however I had my husband check it over....I should return it but don’t wanna go through the hassle. Both pockets have holes in them. I will have to sew them. Also the zippers on the wrong side"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,What a great buy!,5,"I bought this jacket to wear while riding my ebike in the early morning San Francisco weather.  With an ebike, I'm not really doing it to work up a sweat. I just like being outdoors and enjoying time casually riding my ebike through the park and by the ocean. Since it's usually in the mid-50s (temperature), I needed a heavier jacket to wear, so that I don't freeze while riding, especially if windy. I have been so impressed with this jacket, as the wind does not blow through it and it keeps me perfectly warm. The openings at the sleeves doesn't let cold air in because you can tighten the openings as much as you want.  And the zip up to the neck protects from the cold breaking in too. This jacket has been really perfect. I can just wear a long sleeve t-shirt underneath and that's good enough. I got the yellow color which is bright for outdoor riding, but it's not a garish yellow, which is nice too. I have not had any problems with the pocket zippers at all (knock on wood).  I got the Large size and I am 5'9"" and 165 lbs."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Seams splitting and zipper fell off pocket after worn 3 times,1,"We wanted to like this jacket so much.  It looked nice, was warm and fit well.  HOWEVER, the seams started to split (w/o stress applied to it) and the pocket zipper fell off after first attempt to use it.  If the zipper was the only issue, it wouldn't have been returned, but because the seams were barely held together, it had to be returned."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great product very happy,5,I have had this coat now for several months and it has preformed great!! Well worth the money. I do a lot of roofing and other construction it has held up well so far and keeps all the wind out great! Very warm. Last month I was on a roof 35mph winds while it was raining and 36 degrees out it kept me warm and dry all day.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Nice jacket so far,4,"This looks very nice and fits well (medium: I'm 6'1"" & 160 lbs). I only wish it were a bit longer length to cover more for warmth. But it's not short. Just average. I'd have liked more of a parka that's longer. I haven't yet worn this through winter so not sure how warm it will be. Nor had it long enough to know if it's durable. So I'm holding off 1 star for now.I did run it under the sink and water beaded immediately. Tried fluffing it up in the dryer (air setting) and it didn't be puffier but that's fine."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Great jacket, but flimsy micro-zipper flaw ruins it!",3,"I really liked this jacket and got compliments, but day one of wearing it, the pocket zipper broke. :( The pocket micro-zippers are super thin/flimsy on this jacket, which was very disappointing because there are a good number of pockets to store stuff. I returned the jacket. If the manufacturer redesigned this item and replaced the flimsy micro-zippers with more durable/standard sized zippers, I'd purchase this jacket again in a heartbeat!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great high quality winter jacket,5,"Love Love Love this Jacket. It checks off all the boxes for me and has become my go to winter jacket. I’m 6’3”, 215lb and the large fit me perfectly. For the price I’m still shocked at its comfort, warmth and quality. I liked it so much that I had to get my wife the women’s version and she loves it just as much. The one down side for me, which might be a plus for others is that it’s REALLY warm. If it’s above 25 degrees outside and I’m going to be shoveling snow, hiking or any other strenuous activity I can’t wear it because I’ll end up soaked...it’s that good at retaining heat."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Really like it,5,"I’ve worn this several times now in cold weather (10 degrees F) and in snow and it keeps me warm and dry. The pockets close up tight. The arms are a touch long in comparison to the rest of the coat but I like that, they come to the middle of my fingers if I just let them hang. The hood has Velcro to also cover your mouth area which can be helpful in wind wen I’m out on the ice. I’d recommend this coat as it works great at a fraction of the cost of more expensive brands."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Arctic Ready,5,"I received my jacket in an extremely timely fashion. We decided to go sledding at a ski resort in Wisconsin and I needed jacket preparations.Temp: 20’sWind: 15-20 mphFresh snow conditionsWhile wearing this jackets I was wearing a standard long sleeve t-shirt and had plenty of room for a thick hoodie if needed, however the warmth of the jacket had me flashing back to memories in the womb it was so warm.As the wind was blowing I flipped up the hood to check it’s use, and much to my surprise it was comfortable and help shield the wind significantly.I was very comfortable for the three hours we were out and felt that I could have been out in much colder temperatures with no hesitation.Plenty of pockets, good zipper coverage/sealing, and nice adjustable wrist elasticity.The ONLY thing I’d recommend is a mid body snap on the zipper cover flap. Didn’t impact me today however in active snow conditions it would definitively be appreciated.Overall it’s a very well made, seems to be durable fabric, and nice style."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Bought for 14 year old son-Perfect,4,"Coat is very nice, well worth the price. Thanks to some of the reviews on here i got the right size. My son loves Camo, but i could not find a boys coat that was suitable, saw this and was perfect. This is a MEN's coat, my son is 14 years old, 5 .5 , 125 and its a little big, but room to grow. I bought a small. Reviews are helpful, so thank you!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Comfortable, warm, and dry.",4,"Very nice jacket.  Fits well and is warm and windproof.  The zipper was on the left side which had me wondering if might be a ladies jacket, but apparently that is only a button ""thing"".  Regardless, it is nice enough I would not have returned it anyway.  Only other thing that I would have liked is the little loop often found on the inner collar that helps to hang on a hook.  The warmth and comfort far outweigh those minor things."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Exceptional purchase!!!!!,5,As someone who lived most of her life living in extreme cold I am incredibly picky about my coat.  I have never done anything cheaper than Columbia and I prefer Marmot or Northface.  That being said I am very pleasantly surprised by this coat.  It is super comfortable and very warm.  I haven’t had the chance to test its waterproofness yet but the material looks and feels like it is waterproof and the quality appears to be top notch.  Very very excited to have this coat for the winter.....Definitely a worthy purchase!!!!!!
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Buy it... Best jacket for harsh weather by far! Replaces expensive name brand,5,Ive been very sceptical lately with the quality of the items with Amazon lately. Figured id give them another shot since the return policy protects you. This jacket no doubt is equivalent to ones that are hundreds of dallors with name brand if not better.... Took the dog for a 90 min walk. Being a feel like temp of 20 degrees with 8mph wind. It kept me very comfortable with only a t-shirt on. I havent tested it on the bike yet. But I'm fairly confident it will exceed my expectations in time. Quality seems good and I'm fairly sure it will keep a person dry in a storm. The pockets seal well...
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,UNFORTUNATELY..,1,Would've Been Fine...Yet No Thumb Hole For Symmetry of Sleeve and Glove Fit.. Descriotion Doesn't Match Product Sent...Absolutely Henious...
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Nice warm jacket a tad bit large,4,I am 6' 220 pounds.  I typically wear a 46 sports coat.  I bought this jacket in light gray in a XL.  It's big.  There is a lot of room to wear clothes underneath which I was planning to do.  However my wife says i look like the stay puff marshmallow man in it.  I am ordering a large to see the difference.  Beyond this it feels warm and well made.  Pockets are nicely placed.  Cuffs have room for gloves.  It could use a waist draw string to seal off from cold air.  I bought for trip to Montana next month to snowmobile and snowboard.  I will report back again after that.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,The jacket is made in China,5,Best jacket ever only thing people from China need to really look at zippers before they put them on the zipper should be put on the right side and the other thing on the left
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Is warm and good value for what you get!!!,5,"I bought this jacket for you husband.  It was delivered the next day!! My husband loves the warmth of it. He loves the way it fits! He is kind of a big man, so I was worried about if it would fit good, and it does!!! True to it’s size.This is waterproof and light weight. I am happy with it and so surprised at the quick delivery!!!  I would highly recommend this men’s winter coat/ski jacket. My husband is so happy!! Thank you!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Its good,4,I was desperate for a coat.  I knew when I bought this that the zipper would be backwards to the US norm for mens coats.  Its very hard to get used to.  I wont knock it down points for that though.  I knew what I was getting.Its is warm enough for Michigan winter.  Its not bulky which is nice.  The only knock I would give to it is that I wish it was a tad bigger or that I was a tad skinnier (lol). I can still wear it though and it looks nice.  I also wish the hood was removable.  Other than that its great.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Real warm coat, needs quality control",3,Bought this for a recent snowboard trip. Day one of the trip and both pocket zippers broke. Upon return I requested an exchange.  New coat was received yesterday and the first coat was returned to Amazon.  When I examined the replacement coat I found that some of the stitching is coming apart.  The manufacturer needs to step up the quality assurance on the zippers and needlework.  From other reviews this appears to be a big problem.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Definitely worth the money,5,"I am 5’5” female around 195 is the last time I weighed my self so I decided to get an Xl, I just briefly put in on over the thick baggy hoodie I had on and I still have room to move, I could have easily have went with a large and still gotten the jacket over a thick hoodie, I’m very happy with the length though (goes about a quarter last my hip. From what I can tell after briefly looking at it, it is going to be a great jacket for me this winter. Would most definitely recommend buying."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"I'm a large shirt size, but always order medium in jackets and this one fits perfect",5,"It's certainly not Northface quality or weight, but for $65 this is an amazing purchase. My only complaint, which is something I knew about prior to buying, is that the zipper is left-handed which is traditionally for women here in the US and it throws me off since it's the opposite of all of my other jackets. Definitely a great ""get you through the winter"" purchase and I appreciate offerings like this while I'm on a tight budget."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,A few months in,3,"Works well in cold temperatures, however... the arms need to be insulated. They should've made the arms have the same inner material fur. It can get cold at the arms if you aren't wearing a good long sleeve shirt or sweater underneath.  Another problem I had was the main zipper became hard to zip as I washed it a few times. I also noticed the plastic on the left side for the zipper to insert was gone as well making it harder to zip. The hood could use a size up seeing as it doesn't cover my head entirely. I noticed it won't go over my thin hoodie entirely and it's hard to strap the hood in."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Shotty hood draw string, broke with a slight tug.",2,"First time I tried it on. Gave a slight tug on the hood draw string, and it snapped. Very disappointed in that. I can probably fish some parachute cord through it and make it work if it was cold enough to wear it.However, it feels like itll be extremely warm, and I'm typically very warm blooded.Luckily, I'd probably prefer a large beanie with the jacket anyway.I'll make due as this was ordered for a trip to Maine in a week and a half from now."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great product + great price.  Hood could be a little bigger.,5,This jacket was at great price & is VERY warm to the point of having to unzip at times in freezing weather to keep myself from sweating too much.  Personally I feel the hood could be a little bigger but that's just my personal opinion as the hood does cover my head when in use.  Zipper quality seems fine & the inner lining feels very soft & comfy to the touch.  Happy Buyer here.  Thanks.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Warm & Cozy,5,This was for my son who is moving to WA from SoCal and needed a warm jacket. The size chart was weird but I bought a large and it seemed to fit fine. He's about 6ft tall 180 lbs. slim but broad shoulders and long legged. A little bit large around the waist but I figured he would be wearing a sweater underneath so it fit perfectly. Arm length was good and the jacket was long enough to cover is butt. He loved the jacket!
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Really nice for the money, at first...",3,I bought this jacket because I was moving to Boston for work and needed something to keep warm in.  Initially it seems very nice for the money and it indeed keeps me toasty warm even when the Temps drop to 7F!BUT...  There are several seams on the jacket that are sewn together and can easily rip open.  That eventually happened to mine after about a month of use.  I love this jacket but the seams are too easy to rip for me to recommend purchase.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Not a Ski Jacket,2,"The jacket looked great for the price and based on other reviews I did buy it but when it arrived I realized the obvious fact - you get what you pay for. I'm 5'11"" slim built and size M in ski jackets fit me perfectly, so I ordered a size M. While the sleeve length is right, the arms are too big and overall it runs a big large with a puffy feel to it. If I order a Small then I'm sure the sleeve length will be short. But that's not the main point - the jacket lacks basic ski jacket features - powder skirt and ski pass pocket on the sleeve. This to me is an absolute must if you intend to use this as a ski jacket. I haven't tested the warmth factor since I'm returning this product, so I cannot comment on that aspect."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Sizing inconsistent,4,"Bought this jacket for my husband for our trip to NYC. So far he hasn’t worn it yet so I can’t comment on the warmth or waterproofness. It seems well made. The biggest problem is the fit. I ordered size large he is 5’10 165 pounds, he normally wears a medium but wanted a bit of extra room for a hoodie underneath.  The large was tiny, short in the sleeves and tight. Returned it and ordered XXL. Ginormous and ridiculous, returned it for a XL. Still huge, and if it wasn’t for the fact that we are leaving for our trip soon I would return it for a different brand.  The sizing is so inconsistent. I am guessing the size L was mislabeled and it was actually a small."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,1st impression is it is a good coat,4,All around I would say this is a solid coat. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because I don't consider it a true winter coat. A true winter coat I should be able to wear a t-shirt and be able to go outside in winter in Wisconsin and still stay fairly warm. This coat you would still need to layer to stay warm. If you can live with that this is a solid coat at a solid price.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Excellent for the price,4,"I was a little apprehensive about ordering this item because of the reports of off sizing but when it arrived it fit to what I expect an XL should be. The accessory zippers do seem a little small and fragile for their purpose but I have yet to put any significant use into them and will update appropriately. Overall I am at this point very satisfied with the value per dollar on this purchase.Edit: After using this jacket on a snowmobiling trip and skiing for the day, I can attest that the zippers held up 100% thus far and posed no issues whatsoever. It is very warm and comfortable to wear and is easily comparable to jackets costing 2-3 times what other retailers are asking"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Nice winter coat,5,"I love it so far. I bought a men’s small. I’m 5’6” and 130 pounds and it’s a really good fit. Of course, it’s 90 degrees outside right now but I like to hike all year and it appears sturdy enough to be able to do so even in the coldest weather."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Zipper broke in 3 months. No response from seller.,3,Update* they did respond.  It was in message center unnoticed by me. My fault.  I did manage to fix the zipper for now anyway and am talking to seller about the situation. I updated the rating from 1 to 3 stars.  The zipper broke in just 3 months with light use.  Can’t get a response from seller. Return window closed.  Do not buy if product quality isn’t guaranteed.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Love this coat.....but....,4,5 stars for the coat.  Looks great and very warm.  I was out in 6 degree weather and the coat kept me warm and toasty.  3 stars for the zipper.  Others have complained about the zipper failing and I can see it.  Most of the time it zips without a problem.  Sometimes it sticks and doesn't want to start.  Hopefully the zipper holds up because I really do love the coat.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Mens Jacket w/ Left Zipper for Ladies,3,"My husband likes the jacket & lining. While trying it on he pointed out the zipper is on the left, I had to assure him it's a mens jacket. He asked me to try it on to see if I like it LOL. It was for him as a gift. smh. The fit is good. It is a light weight jacket but warm for it's size. We'll keep instead of the hassle of return. ***Wouldn't recommend as a gift unless you want an emabarrassing situation for yourself and the recipient."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Sent a used jacket with a ski pass on it.,1,Product is exceptional! Son is thrilled.I'm totally irritated that it came with a lift pass attached to it from February. I paid for a NEW coat and was sent a USED one.Bad PR Amazon. Hence the 1 star rating. We'll keep it - cause it can be washed. But seriously. I should get some money back.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Outstanding! Would definitely buy again! What,5,"I have gotten a few compliments on this jacket (I got the gray camouflage design). I ordered it a size larger to accommodate a few sweaters I have that I planned to layer under it. Also, I typically like the extra room. I would say the fit is as expected.  Today, I stood for 45 minutes in 9° temperature and it kept me sufficiently warm and cozy! Very satisfied buyer!!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,A decent price for a descent product!,5,"At 6'2"" and 190lbs the larger size could be a little tighter at the waist or maybe add a drawstring as there is no elastic at the bottom, but overall a good fit. Arm length is right on, water resistance is good, it's warm with a long sleeve thermal at 30 degrees, winds resistance is nice - collar could be a little tighter for winds drafts, hood removal is a nice option. Overall a good product for everyday living and snowboarding, hiking. Not to thick, not to thin - comfortable while driving."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,SUPER WARM but fits smaller than expected,4,"I bought this because I'll be doing medic work on a fishing boat in the Bering sea. First, let me say this coat is WARM. You will NOT get cold in this coat. The icy wind could be blowing wave-cicles onto me and I won't feel a thing. That being said, buy a size up. I expected this coat to be longer and wider along the chest going by the measurements described by size. Still, fantastic coat. You won't be disappointed."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Well made attractive coat,5,"Just got this coat and I love it. I am 6'3"" and 280 lbs. The 2XL fits me perfect.  The zipper on the left will take a little getting use to but no big deal. Of course I can't say how the coat will hold up in the long run but if it doesn't will let you know. The fabric has an expensive feel to it though the coat is not expesive.."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,All in all a nice coat,4,"XL was way to big so I returned it got a Lg. and it just fits.  I'm 5' 11"" 185 lbs, 45"" chest 34"" waist.  Zipper is on the left hand side which I thought was a ladies coat but the coat said mens.  No draw string around the waist which would be nice.  Keeps the cold out at least in mid 20's and breezy weather.  All in all its a nice coat and I am happy with it but it's not great.  For the price though It is great."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,A steal at $65,5,"Tremendous value and fit like a glove. I'm 5 foot 9 in 155 lb and the medium is a perfect fit.  Warm as hell and waterproof, can't believe I almost spent $275 for a Columbia coat.  Zipper seams a little on the cheap side but what the hell, it costs $65!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Larger size than you think,4,"This jacket was super warm and checked all the boxes I wanted for a winter coat, but the sizing is crazy! I ordered a men’s small, as I am 5 10”- 145lbs, and it fit more like a large-medium. Jacket is a lot bigger than you think from the pictures. If it fit better I would have kept it, but I returned because it was just too big/boxy for my body frame."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,If your skinny and my height large is fine ..but if your muscular get xl.,4,The fit i bought was large because of the reviews. Im 5.9 204 lbs. The large was perfect fit if you dont wear a sweatshirt underneath was a little to snug for me got xtra large perfect now northeast here gotta wear other undergarments here. Love the coat nice style warm hoodie detachable.  I only gave 4 star cause the zipper is revesered ...side..
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Fit is Odd,3,"The fit in the shoulders was good with plenty of room, but the waist was a little snug which was unexpected. The zipper is a women's style with pull on the left, also awkward. I would have returned it but if fits OK"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Stay dry and warm. Good buy for the price,5,"Great jacket, very warm, water resistant and looks nice. Main zipper in front is great. The pocket zippers are garbage. Too thin and you know the ones that are gonna come apart, yeah, those are whats here. For the money, its very comfortable and aGood buy. It works well as far as the warmth and keeping you dry. Just needs better zippers on the pockets"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Love this coat!,5,"My boyfriend bought this coat to have something warm to wear this winter and he is not disappointed!! It fits perfectly. Not too tight and not too loose. The color is great, the material feels like amazing quality, and the soft interior material is perfect for keeping anyone toasty :) So happy and definitely recommend!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,WONDERFUL JACKET and GREAT PRICE,5,Absolutely LOVE this jacket.  It could not have come at the right time.  We just had 6 inches of snow and i got a chance to try out the jacket.  Extremely warm.  Love the extra room in the hood.  This jacket is a steal at that price.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,After 5 minutes,5,"I bought this as my only coat for winter. So far so good. Perfect fit. Its warm but still lighter than expected. And the material is very well made for the price. Pockets aren't too small and the cuffs are adjustable. I'm heavier and it still makes me feel comfortable when zipped. Honestly, 10/10 for me so far. I will edit with details when it snows!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Love the adjustable velcro wrist closures,5,"Better materials and construction than I expected. Extremely warm. There are velcro wrist wraps that I can adjust to two different sizes to fit one wrist with a watch, and the other without.  I was surprised to see it came sealed and vacuum-shrunk down very small, so I'm getting one for my backpack and leaving it sealed. Great value."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Perfect,5,"I live in the mountains where it is usually freezing or below freezing temps at night and in the morning. Even with my ski jacket, I am always wearing layers of sweatshirts and jackets under it. Not with this jacket. It is warm yet breathable. I don't sweat in it and I only wear a shirt underneath it. I highly recommend it."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Disappointed but not surprised,4,"My boyfriend and I went skiing for the first time and we used these jackets. They worked alright. They did what they were made to do, but it really wasn't anything fancy. NOT TO FCKIN MENTION the womans jacket has a faux front pocket while the men's jacket gets an actual. pocket. Do you know how EXCITED I was for that front pocket?? ""Wow! 4 pockets!"" were my exact words. But alas, I was let down. So take your 4 star rating and your useless faux pocket."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Very very warm.,5,So warm that I almost had heat stroke when I wore it inside the grocery store. This thing is for people who are out in the really cold elements for long periods of time. Used it on a boat running up river in Nov in MO and it kept me toasty. I have only had it a while so I can’t speak to the longevity of this product.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Excellent quality and design at a very good price,4,The fit was better than expected. Extra large size I normally wear provides ample comfort and room for movement while shoveling snow in freezing weather without being baggy. Materials and design are excellent. Very comfortable.and fashionable. Could probably use a couple of extra snap fasteners along the middle of the zipper flap for a little more warmth and protection.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great product,5,"This jacket is awesome! Everything I expected, however I should’ve took heed to the reviews because I ordered a size up and it was too large. This product definitely fits true to size. I’m sending mine back for a smaller size. I loved it, my son loved it n we’re  both excited about getting the right size. It’s a very nice winter jacket!!!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Runs large. Poor zippers,3,Very nice jacket going on my first snowboarding trip this weekend will update performance after. The jackets run large I’m 6’2” 220lbs the shoulders were too wide and the arms were a few inches past my hands. A large fits me perfect. Update: zippers are low quality both came off the tracks within 2 wears.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great warm multi-purpose snow jacket,5,"I like that this jacket's hood zips off completely and the jacket isn't too bulky to use for cold weather other than snow. The jacket looks sharp and can be worn for snow sports or as a warm jacket to wear with slacks and and nice shirt to the office. The jacket fits perfect too, its not to big and doesn't restrict movement. The warn fleece inside is super comfortable."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Functions well!,5,"This is my first “Snow” jacket I have ever worn/purchased. When I went RTV’ing in the Rocky’s, I threw this jacket on for the first time and first impressions were: It fit just right, sleeves were not too long, zippers never malfunctioned, kept me warm, dry, and it was comfy!Although I have never owned a snow jacket prior to this one and I can’t compare it to other jackets in this category, I give it a 5/5."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Wonderful!,5,"I would recommend this jacket to anyone who wants to stay warm and dry, particularity when the wind is blowing on a cold and blustery day.  The wind would eat right through other jackets that I've worn, but this one is remarkable in its ability to neutralize the effects of cold winds.Another great feature is the pockets.  They are nice and deep which allows me to keep my gloves in them without  causing a bulge.  Lastly, it's fairly lightweight for a winter jacket."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Best Buy Ever On Amazon,5,"I will say one solitary thing about my deal on Amazon. I will match this winter jacket against any 300 dollar jacket on the market today. It will match or exceed your expectations, but if they are still sixty bucks, it will please your wallet and chase away the shivers and wind, as it is impervious to wind or rain, and the Faux Fur inside it will please you that like Coyotes, that is up to the point when they eat your Cat."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Mixed results,3,"Overall this didn't seem like a bad jacket but did not fit how I wanted it to or thought it would based on the photos. Length of the body was good Length of the sleeves was good but the jacket I ordered was too large in the body for me. But had I gone down a size would have definitely been too short, and the main reason I had to return this was the sleeves diameter around was WAY to large. I could have easily put 3 of arms in one sleeve which made the fit and look awkward. It is also very thin, maybe good as a shell but was not what I was looking for. As far as the pattern on the jacket it did look good and well done. Just wished it didn't fit so awkwardly."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,It's a pretty nice coat for the money. Nice enough to wear on a night out.,4,So far so good. The temperature hasn't been cold enough to get a good idea how warm it is. So far it's been decent for the wind. Keeps me warm in 30 degrees. There should be a cold snap in February. I will find out then. Down side is I bought it for a work coat. I am afraid of messing it up. I like the style. Classy coat .
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Zipper busted after 12 days,2,"Great overall jacket. Very warm, and doesn’t attract my pets’ fur, but after wearing it for ten days the zipper on the right pocket has already broken. The pocket zippers are of horrible quality."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Felt Cheap,3,"The garment was light, not like a typical sji jacket or winter coat, any seemed to be made from cheap materials. The fit was like wearing a box. It looked nice and may be more suited for someone looking for something more basic. Disappointed, but that's cool- it happens. I returned the coat."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great Ski Jacket,4,"This was a great ski jacket, especially when you consider the price. It fit well over my bibs, was warm and had just the right number of pockets. My one complaint is that if zipped all the way up, the collar was a bit too tall for my body. That’s more a me thing, and I’m sure most would be very happy."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Comfortable, fits well",4,"Very comfortable jacket, I'm 6'5 and very lanky and it fits my long arms perfectly. That being said, that means that the arm length runs large (but that's what you want for winter).I had a really weird discovery in my new jacket. It came with a bandana inside of one of the pockets, balled up with what I believe is snot in it. Wtf? Well, free snot covered bandana, I guess.I would recommend this jacket, just don't be surprised if you end up with a snot covered bandana in the pocket. lol"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Nice,4,This coat is of good quality. I was disappointed as I ordered this for a Christmas gift for my grandson and received the women's jacket instead of mens. I even doubled check my order to make sure it was a mens jacket I ordered and not a women's.  It worked out though as I ended up giving it to my granddaughter.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great jacket,5,Jacket is awesome. I really enjoyed wasting it. It fit great. I ordered the XXL. It was nice to have the extra room to move around in.The jacket kept me warm and dry! Highly recommend it.The only thing I didn’t like was the yellow brand embroidery on the jacket.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Zipper on the left?,4,"Very warm jacket, went from wearing a wool sweatshirt, and a wool overcoat. To wearing a tank top, or t-shirt and this jacket.Ordered a large, incase I wanted to add another layer, and I can do so if I like. Sizing is accurate.The only weird thing I noticed immediately is the zipper is on the left side. Made me question whether it was a man's jacket.Extremely warm, comfortable, looks masculine, but zipper is a bit awkward for me."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Don’t like the gold writing,3,It’s a nice jacket but there was a couple things I didn’t like . For one the picture makes the gray color look dark gray when it actually looks blueish . Also didn’t like the large gold shiny writing on it showing the brand . It looks like a free jacket you got from your job cause if it .
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great for MA Winters,5,I bought this for my hubby as a Christmas gift.  Took a chance based on your descriptions.  The fit is perfect for him.  He plans to use it for Winter outings here in Massacheusetts.  Zipper on his previos jacket quit on him as he was shoveling snow.  I like the zippered pockets & the attached hood.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Good quality but is bulky and big,4,"I love everything about the jacket honestly other than it is over sized and not very flattering due to it's sheer bulk and over size. Order a size down, possibly two and it would be perfect. I didn't return it because a too large jacket is better than no jacket when its under 30 degrees. It is definitely warm, has a good amount of pockets and the zippers although plastic, seem of high quality so far."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great jacket to keep you warm in the wind and snow,5,I ordered this jacket just in time for our trip to Michigan and Ontario. This jacket definitely kept me warm while playing in the snow with the kiddos in single digit temps. Great product. The zipper is on the left side which takes a little getting used to otherwise all else is wonderful.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Good fall coat not a winter coat,1,For the price it could have lasted a whole winner in a purchase the code and fall got all the way up until almost the end of winter pocket started ripping and pocket started zippers coming off like I said for the 60 70 bucks could have a better product $80 would have got me a Carhartt and that would have been durable good for the fall good for like just hanging out but not for any type of using it everyday
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Stands up to the cold.,4,"I was pleasantly surprised how well this coat kept me insulated in sub zero conditions. I work in McGrath, Alaska and I spend more than five hours a day working outside. It got down to -15 a couple of days last week and this coat blocked the wind and cold and I stayed pretty comfortable wearing only a flannel shirt underneath. The hood could probably be a bit bigger, but it's a good buy nonetheless."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Beautiful all the way around!,5,"Bought for my Brother.  Love the vibrant color!  Fit is as should be!  It is light weight in hand, yet has the warm retaining heat inside that will be great for our harsh winters!  Glad we found this!  Will be buying the female version for myself!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Nice Jacket but......,3,"I ordered this jacket for my husband. He tried it on and was thrilled. It seemed like it would be very warm and fit perfect. However, in the pockets he found a hotel room key, 2 airplane boarding passes and a used chapstick! I'm sure someone used this jacket and returned it and we probably never would have known but the company should check the pockets of returns before repackaging and re-selling."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Hole in pocket,3,Hole in right pocket right when I opened the package. Luckily it never bothered me enough to send it back because I needed it when I got it. It’s very warm. Hood is removable. I guess it’s just a hit or miss on whether you are going to get one in one piece of if it’s already going to be broken upon arrival.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Epic,5,"Great fit, Incredibly warm, durable, I LOVE LOVE LOVE in the inner fleece lining. I found the god zipper a little small, so I do hope it doesn’t break easily. It help me VERY WARM AND DRY. I ran across 4 people at the ski resort wearing the exact same jacket. I’m very happy with the jacket."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Warm but gave allergic reaction,1,Jacket fitted nicely but the inside lining was shedding really bad and sticking to my close and causing a allergic reaction to bad because was warm was hoping to save money got a name brand instead.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Glued coat. Do not buy.,1,"Warm coat,, but...  Coat was beige not white.Washed once and the glue holding the zippers together started popping loose everywhere. (Yes, you read that right, glue)Cheap coat at a high price (for what it is)Not at all impressed."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,First coat in years,5,"This is a great jacket. I needed a jacket because we were headed to Chicago, in the winter.I dont own jackets, I usually throw on a goodie and I'm all set.  Prior to getting this, I would take my dog out to play in the snow and fetch. I'd get cold in about 20 minutes and go inside.With this coat, I can stay out a lot longer. My body does not get cold. I 100% recommend this coat.For sizing, I am 5'9, 190 (could stand to lose a couple inches in the waist. LG is a tad bit too big, but I feel a Medium would be too small. For reference though, I wear an XL t shirt because of my shoulders"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Thin and warm,5,"This jacket is thin, but doesn't lack for warmth. Felt like a superhero, immune to cold and wind through an often single degree Chicago winter, and I'm often outdoors for work. It looks good except the hood, while very warm, has a bit of a janky fit, so I took it off after wearing it once.I wouldn't recommend it for more mild climates as it's too warm above 30.I'm 5ft 7in, pretty broad across chest and shoulders and a medium fits well, in a form fitting kind of way. The length is good for me but could be a bit short for those of you blessed with more height."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Nice jacket, order a size up",5,"Got this coat for work, I spend my fair share of time exposed to the elements.Comfortable and definitely warm but runs a bit small. By measurement on their size chart I should have ordered a medium but licky for me I ordered a large and its a good fit, if a bit more snug than I was anticipating. I'd reccomend ordering a size up from what you would expect."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Tight fit and wet interior,3,"Fits a little snug, sizes are cut small and coat does not breath well. It will keep you warm but makes you sweat tremendously. There is no material to barrier that wetness from sweating so long exposure on slopes you will get cold."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Nice quality good price for a ski coat.,5,"This is an amazingly warm and very stylish!  I ordered for my 13 year old son.  Got him an adult medium.  He has plenty of room even with a sweatshirt underneath.  Washes up well,  make sure to use cold water gentle cycle and no fabric softener and hang to dry."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great coat,5,"I really like the fit. I wear a Large and this is a good fit, snug enough so cold air isn't coming up the bottom but loose enough so I can move around and I have a little larger than normal shoulders. The material is good and the interior fuzzy lining really keeps you feeling warm. Good value."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great price excellent quality,5,"Cold weather has moved in and our average is -10 with highs of 35 degrees for the next 3 months.  My son is a men's size small and hates bulky coats.  This is warm, rain resistance and not overly bulky.  He likes it a lot and wears it everyday. Great snow coat, winter coat and highly recommend for the price.  It compares to the high end coats 3x the price of this one.  My son does not mind the unknown branding as it still is great quality."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Very Comfortable Fit - And Very Warm,5,"I bought 5 jackets, including a really nice Caterpillar jacket, but this one, even though less expensive, was more comfortable than any of them. I was in 20 degree (Fahrenheit) weather and it wasn't a problem at all. The hood has a Velcro strap that is very convenient as well. The only gotcha with the jacket is that they used pretty cheap zippers for the hand pockets. That would be the one upgrade that would be nice."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Warm,5,Great jacket for the price. The most important thing is it is warm. The features with zip up pockets Velcro straps on end of the sleeves and the hood make it a good jacket. its good looking as well. The sleeves on mine we a little long but with the Velcro cuffs it is not an issue.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,CAMO COLOR IS PERFECT FITS THIS FAT MAN,5,"XXL fit my (fat 260 lb.) 6 foot frame perfect. enuff room underneath to add a sweater if needed. Cold here in Central Wisconsin. Warm hood with essential chin covering. Zips up easily to fully cover my three chins! Sleeve length perfect! (34-35 w/19 inch neck in dress shirt) Three outside, one inside pockets ALL ZIP UP, BOOHRAH! The color is absolutely the best! Makes you stand out but looks masculine, not preppy. For $75, I couldn't be more satisfied!!! thank you!!!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great coat.....highly recommend,5,Bought for my son. He is 5'11 and  230lbs got the xl he is broad shoulders and long arms and it fits perfect plenty of room for a sweatshirt under it. The zippers do snag a bit and feel cheap but the rest of the coat is awesome. VERY warm very soft and comfortable.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great jacket for the value,5,"This jacket works great at keeping rain and wind out! I haven't got to take it skiing yet, but I have no doubt it'll hold up just fine.Got caught in a bad rain storm in downtown Nashville, had to walk half a mile back to my workplace in the pouring rain. Had this Jacket on, my upper body stay completely dry, and the wind never penetrated it."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"WAS NOT LOOKING FOR THIS BRAND  ,, BUT OK",4,"I WAS ON THE PAGE LOOKING AT THE BRAND I TYPED IN AND WAS SEEING ALL THAT BRANDS STYLES , UNBEKNOWN IN THE MANY , MANY ITEMS THE BRAND SWITCHED AND THIS BRAND SHOWED UP ,,,FELT A LITTLE FOOLED , JACKET ARRIVED SEEMS OK .. WISH I WAS A BIT MORE ALERT ..I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS A BAIT AND SWITCH ,,,, BUT WHY NOT SOME NOTICE"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great coat even better price!,1,"My husband didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a coat. I said I would buy it for him and we got our bang for the buck!  He walks the dog in freezing temperatures and absolutely loves this coat. He has broad shoulders and an extra large fit perfectly. It really is waterproof, too. I love the bright colors for walking in the dark."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Zips with left hand.,3,Quality looks good. It has the zipper on left side. Awkward since I am right handed. Zipper is not metal like a winter jacket should.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Buy it. You wont regert it,5,"So I've waited a bit to review about 3 weeks. It's now been -15⁰to-20⁰ here and this jacket is somehow warm like really warm. I'll wear a t shirt under and be fine its awesome its waterproof and its lightweight.  I'd say its TOTALLY worth it. Pretty darn impressive, I was very skeptical but you'll be happy. Fits exactly as expected."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Love the coat but came damaged.,3,"It is a great coat. Does well in the rain and feel it will be great when it gets colder. Would have probably given it 5 stars except it came damaged and I will not be able to use the draw strings on the hood. If I was using it for extreme conditions for any length of time this is an import part of the coat. Call me lazy In not wanting to go through a whole return process, I expect a new item to come new, not damaged."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Better than expected,4,"Super warm coat. I wore a thermal base layer and this coat, and I was sweating while snowboarding. Definitely wind proof and water proof. The coat was a little bit big and the zippers seem a bit cheap. If you only experience snow a few times a year, there's no need to buy an expensive ski coat. This jacket delivers!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Good for Alaskan winter,5,"I got this jacket for a trip a Fairbanks, AK in February. It was a great jacket. I had it in Sub-Zero temperatures, wind, and snow. At any given time, I was wearing the jacket and a thermal shirt underneath and I never felt a hint of wind or precipitation.At $50 this is a great deal. I've only used it for 5 days so I can speak to quality, but zippers feel sturdy so far."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great jacket!,5,"I originally bought this jacket as my 'dog walking jacket', but it is so much more.  It is basically my all around outdoor jacket.  It fits well and is extremely warm - I have gone for a walk in 32 degree weather just wearing a t-shirt.  The hood is also nice and big.  My only suggestion would be to make the glove openings larger for accessing stuff with gloves on."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great jacket for cold New England weather,5,"I'm quite happy with my purchase of this jacket, I photograph nature/wildlife and landscapes and it can get pretty cold in Massachusetts during the winter, I'm confident that this will keep me nice and toasty. Construction seems to be quite sturdy, a well made jacket."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Warm, lightweight,  comfortable",5,"I bought the womans coat for me and I absolutely love it. I kept raving about this coat. Lightweight,  comfortable and warm, so I bought one for my boyfriend.  He loves this coat too for all the same reasons.  Great coat, great value."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Warm, quality coat at a great price.",5,"I like the removable hood, the cinch sleeves, the bright yellow color, the warmth, and the overall quality.  It's a little bigger than the ""Large"" size I typically wear, but not enough to make me return it for a ""Medium""."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Bad zippers but comfy coat,3,"Not a bad coat, super comfy but the zippers on the pockets easily break off or rip off.  I have two pocketa left that actually closes.  all other three pockets have the zippers ripped off. Kinda sad.."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great Jacket!!,5,So glad I read reviews and decided on this jacket.  Ordered this for my son who went back to college without packing a coat/jacket. A few weeks into the semester a major cold spell hit and he had nothing!! Ordered and arrived in two days.  He loves it. Temps went down into the teens and he was warm.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Exceptional,5,I was very skeptical as of never hearing of the brand or what not before. Could not have been more pleasantly proved wrong. Hands down the best coat I’ve ever owned. Been wearing it for 6 months now. Saved my ass all over Europe and North America so far. I’ve seen all types of weather in it and nothing phases is. Rock solid coat .
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Very satisfied,5,"I was outfitting for winter weather here. I had second thoughts about ordering a large (me - US 41 ) as overseas sizes can be problematic. Arrived in time for snow storm! It is very warm, and am not at all disappointed."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"This jacket is well made, warm and keeps my son dry",5,I bought the jacket for my son who is out in the elements most of the time. He wanted something waterproof and warm. I ordered a Large and it fits just right with a shirt underneath. Temps are down in Seattle and damp as well with snow. He says he is very warm and sometimes unzips a little due to heat while wearing it. Highly recommend this jacket
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,nice product,4,I bought this to replace my daily coat. so far I love it. fits great. is warm. The only drawback and hard to get used to is the zipper is on the wrong side. left hand zip instead of the normal right hand zip.....
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Very good thermal insulation and good quality,4,It has good insulation. I was traveling in utah in 20 degrees f and I didn't feel cold at all. It is little oversized for me even though it is medium size. So I would just recommend buying a smaller size than you wear for your tshirts. But overall I would definitely recommend this jacket.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Better than expected!,5,"Packed it in an airtight bag so I did not have to place an oversized bulky box in my car. The coat fits like a glove. Kept my husband very warm. He really appreciated the hood. The lining kept his head warm and it strapped snug across his neck. Living in NJ, we battle snow and extremely cold winds during the winter season. This coat is a perfect fit for our region. I was so impressed by the fit that I am ordering one for myself. Great buy!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,So warm!,5,"This jacket is crazy warm. I love it. It is also waterproof. The hood also secures across your neck, which works well when you're active, but looks kinda silly when you're not skiing. So I am not sure whether I am in favor of it or not... But overall I highly recommend it!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Why is the name of the coat everywhere on it??,1,"I ordered this coat for my husband who desperately needed one but it was HUGE on him, hes usually a large in jackets but this one was like a XXL on him. The coat literally says the name of it all over it, so whoever wears this is a constant advertisement for the brand. It seems like a nice coat but the name all over it seems excessive. Definitely returning it and finding one that does not make my husband a walking ad."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,5 Star,5,"My tall & thin  12 yr old granddaughter loved the way this jacket looked online and wanted it. Got the black camo in men’s size small, and fit great ! The coat is very warm, well-made and waterproof. She absolutely loves it."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Christmas gift,5,My son loves it. He says it’s very warm. He’s a tall kid and the sleeves are easily long enough.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Good for the price.,3,The jacket is very warm and did seem water and wind proof.  I used it for about 4 days in 2 to 30 degree F weather with ample snow and wind.  It is a ladies style zipper and like others mentioned the stiching around the pocket tore on first use.  The jacket is still usable but wish the quality was better.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Very happy with purchase!,5,"Ordered a 2xl for my son. He's 6'4"" and 270 lbs. He loves the fit. He can wear it with a sweatshirt underneath if need be. Large pockets. Super soft inside and hood. Only negative I can find, so far, is that there's no loop inside to hang it on."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Perfect present!,5,"I bought this for my husband, he hates the cold and refuses to do any activities outside once it drops below 50F. This jacket is stylish and it still is super warm! He loves it and we can now go and do activities outside. What he loves most is that it isn't bulky, it is still very warm without getting to Michelin-man level."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Excellent Extremely Warm,5,Outstanding coat.  Extremely warm and comfortable.  Maintains body heat.  I already tested it in the rain and windy conditions.  Excellent.  I will be using it when I attend various outdoor events in NYC during winter months.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Finally a coat that does it all,5,"Nice and light,perfect fit, nice  zippers,nice size pockets,waterproof! Wind does nor penetrate!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,nice and warm,4,bought for a trip to Chicago and worked perfect. 13 degrees when we landed I pulled the jacket from my suitcase and was toasty warm.  Jacket packs nicely too.  Only thing I have noticed is the zipper is on the opposite side from what I am used to
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Your jacket was perfect and so excellent looking!,5,"I can't wait for my hubby to open this Christmas morning! His jacket was stolen @ work and all he's had us a sweater to wear. It looks so perfect! Thank you, you are going to make a 63 yr old man very happy! Merry Christmas!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"Great Jacket, Great Price!",5,"Great quality for the price. Good design for all winter activities. Looks like a more expensive jacket. I wore mine skiing in 12° weather and was toasty warm. Great fit, ordered a Large for 5’ 10” 180lbs. Hood detaches. Front pocket has a rubberized zipper which is nice, large enough to hold an iPhone 8 Plus with Otterbox defender."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Good for tall kids,5,"I bought this for my son who has mostly outgrown kid’s jackets. At 125 lbs, the small fits him well with some room to grow. The coat is good quality and is warm. I’m looking forward to him growing out of it so I can use it myself!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Short and wide for me.,3,"I'm 6'1"" tall / 260 pounds guy and this XXL jacket was too wide and somewhat short for me.  Real shame cause design of this jacket was right on spot.  I'm not holding my breath to see this Murdering brand correct measurements any time soon cause majority of customers find them OK."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Warm and stylish but beware quality,4,"I've been wearing this jacket for about a month now and it holds up to cold weather, especially skiing and snow.However, after just a month the lining on the inside pocket has torn and now my hand goes through the pocket and touches the inner layer of insulation.Overall, I still enjoy wearing the jacket and I will continue to wear it but the seam quality isn't top notch.  Will find a way to repair it."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Cheap but to cheaply made .,2,I was in a need of a new coat but lacked money to buy a more expensive coat .So i found this one .It fit just fine and is warm enough .But sadly it was to cheaply made .1st thing in about 2 months after i got it the zipper on the chest pocket failed .I'm like okay ......Not important .Just put my phone in the pocket inside .Then the main zipper failed .Do not buy this coat .It literally fails in 4 months of use ( return window is with in 3 months ) .
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Factory quality control flaw,3,"The coat was wonderful for keeping me warm during a Chicago winter. Fit was perfect. The only problem was the left pocket wasn't sewen in completely from the factory.  I called Amazon and without hesitation, they took it back so I could exchange it.  Let you know how the replacement coat is. Till then stay warm"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great for our Colorado weather,5,My husband really likes this jacket!!! It’s very well made and extremely warm for our Colorado weather. My husband plows snow as a hobby/side job and this has made a huge difference for him staying warm and dry! He is 6ft and 230 and we got him a XL and he has room to layer up with his coveralls and hoodie underneath.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,This coat is warm,5,"I really like the materials used to make this coat. There are some spots where cotton is exposed in the stitching however, there's no issue with major noticeable flaws. This coat keeps me extremely warm and this coming from someone who's anemic. I love the féaux fur lining it's soft and dense without skin irritation. I did get this coat as a woman because I like to layer up and have space. I'm also very tall and I like my sleeves to go past my wrist which they do."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Well made,5,"Bought a med for my 16 yr old grandson, he is tall and skinny. Fits him very nicely with room for a hoodie under it. He loves it and it also has a good size zippered pocket inside the jacket which he loves for his phone and cash for school."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Nicely made,5,"My son wares an XL I bought an XL he slipped it on over his head without unzipping it so It runs a little big. He likes the ro ok m so he's keeping it. Nicely made, good looking coat and a good price thanks."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Nice pretty blue ski jacket,5,I can't take a picture of this jacket right now because my son has wanted and he loves it and he swears by it it does what it says it does and I will be buying more from this product again.
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,fits as expected a little snug but i gaine weight,5,love the inner fleece i just wished the arms had it too but it doesnt. looks like it can withstand windy condition but still have to try.feels light and might not be warm for 20 or below but will have to try still
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,SUPER WARM !!!,5,"This jacket is amazing !!!!! Water just beads of it like rain hitting a tarp. When zipped up , zipper flap snapped and hoodie up it blocks all wind and you literally turn into a furnace ... wore this outside last night , it was 18 degrees with a windchill of 6 degrees ( Typical Buffalo winter night in Jan ) and my friend was freezing and I was just about sweating !!!!! I highly recommend this jacket . Hands down the warmest jacket I’ve ever own . And it’s really nice as well ."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"First order, way too big!  Second order, charged $20 dollars more for same jacket in smaller size!",4,"My child loved the look of this jacket and I ordered a medium but it fits like a 2x. Not sure if the tag was put on the wrong jacket or if they just come bigger than size. Sadly I will be sending it back.Sent it back and went to order the jacket again in a smaller size this time and I was charged $20 more. Jacket fit great, kid liked it but man did i get ripped off!"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Very Warm,5,"I live in Kansas and never know what to expect from weather from day to day. Bought this because I was looking for something in between a light jacket and heavy parka. Didn't know what to expect but I gotta say, wore it for the first time to a football game knowing the wind was going to gust to 50 mph and wind chill was gonna hit about 25. Never did I feel any wind and kept me comfortably warm. I love this coat. Ordered a large and it fits just right. I was looking at buying a North Face or Columbia but glad I found this and way less in price."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,I expected a warm winter coat.  Falls short of the description.,1,"If you are looking for a warm winter coat, keep scrolling.  Disappointed would be an understatement.  I expected a winter coat, but that isn't what I received.  This coat weighs far less than an average fall jacket.  While it looks fine, the materials are light and cheap.  If you live in an area where it gets below freezing, don't waste your money on this coat."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Good product cheap price,4,"Hated that the zipper is on the wrong side. All zippers seem a little cheap. Wore this to football game in December, outside in midwest. Was as warm as if I was on the sofa. Was skeptical because of price but I spent my last $300 on football tkts so I took a chance. What a chance it was."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"BAD ZIPPERS, Broke first time I tried it on.",1,"Not only did they send the wrong color, something I would have probably lived with.  When I tried it on for the first time the zipper broke.  Was not going to wait for a third strike so I packed it up and sent it right back."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Zipper is on the wrong side,4,"So this coat looks sharp, keeps me warm, pockets are great and very well made for the long haul. My problem is the zipper is on the wrong side. Not a big deal but its annoying."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Runs big. Rocks hard.,5,"This jacket has changed the way I look at life. Can a jacket do that? You bet your sweet bippy.I bought this baby to keep me safe from a puppy who was bitey as all hell and loved to frolic in mud and poop. To say the least I needed something bulletproof.This jacket is not bulletproof.But puppy proof for sure. It’s also pretty wind, rain, snow, nip and slip proof.Gusseted arms allow for a solid range of motion. So quick movements are a piece of cake.Jacket doesn’t come with cake.But the new lease on life comes with its ability to be warm when you need warm and not too warm when you don’t. I’ve worn it in 20 degree weather and 60 degree weather without issue. All I changed was the layering. Sherpa interiors for the win.This jacket doesn’t come with Tenzig Norgay.Size wise, this mono-colored dream coat runs big. I’m a shorter fella with a fairly slim frame and I’m rolling in a small. It’s a hair on the short side. But a medium made me feel like I was wearing a circus tent.This jacket doesn’t come with a circus.My faith in inexpensive clothing restored, I recommend this jacket to anyone who needs a jacket to go outside.  If you’re the type to wear a jacket inside, it’s a little bulky for that. And definitely too much jacket for sleeping.This jacket is the only two season jacket you’ll ever need. Unless you need something different, you know, for a nice night out or a formal event like a wedding. It does come in black, but I imagine the your suit jacket would poke out the bottom.That would be a faux pas.I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),"Love the jacket, but the medium was just barely too small",5,"I ordered the large and medium. The large was a little big. The medium seemingly fit great, it looked really good on me, but it was a little tight around the armpits, especially with a hoodie on under it. Since I bought this jacket for working outside I kept the large so I could be comfy. I'm 5'11"", 175lbs with a 41"" chest. Hope this helps someone."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Fits great. Love it.,5,"Wow. A jacket that actually fits me. Amazing. The sleeves are perfect. Normally when I reach out, or over my head, the sleeve will come half way to my elbow, but these are perfect. The flaps cut in the shoulders allow for a much wider range of motion which is exactly what I need from a work jacket.I'm an aircraft maintenance tech and work outside on the flight where its cold and windy, so the extra long tail and inner cuffs in the sleeves are great for keeping the draft off my back. I'm not a huge fan of hoods, BUT, the extra material around the neck does the keep out. Also, it's very warm, but not overly bulky, which great for climbing in out of confined spaces.Overall,  I've been extremely happy with almost everything Carhartt has put, and this is no exception."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),it feels good quality and durability,4,"I measure 1.82m and weight 82kg, arm length is 60cm and shoulder to shoulder 48cm.I buy a size Medium tall and I fit well in my opinion, why I like my clothes to be loose but if you like it to fit you can buy a size S"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),"Get the ""medium tall"" if ur slim and tall enough for a Large but not fat enough~!",5,"I am 5’11” , 180 lbs. slim, no gut yet.I got the medium size it seems a bit tight in the shoulder and short on the arms. I got the large too as size comp. It had longer arms  which was perfect  and more space in the shoulder. it was a longer skirt too but added many inches around the waist. cold air would come in even with a hoodie on under it and it  was really baggy at the stomach when sitting, i had to wear 2 sweatshirts to fill it out. So Get the medium tall and it fits perfect. It has longer arms and wider sholder when i move the wrist collars stay put allows for more motion. and a longer skirt at  The waist. size is the same as the medium waist but there’s more room in this coat and stays tailor to body.  I have had the previous version if this coat for 12 years and the medium tall is like the old medium from way back."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Rugged waist-length jacket,3,"Returning this jacket in size 2XLT. Carhartt B & T sizing seems all over the place. The Bartlett is more generously cut than other 2019 release B & T Carhartt jackets, but smaller than previous season's. It is a waist-length jacket. On black, Carhartt logo tag is not black as pictured. Weird surprise: stretch band on sleeves have blood pressure cuff levels of compression on wrists. If you wear a large watch or are big-boned, this could be uncomfortable."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Carthart review,5,"I thought I’d give the carthart jacket a try moving from the south to the north.I ABSOLUTELY love the jacket so much that I bought the black one also.I work outdoors and it has come in very handy.The range of motion for it is perfect. It fits just perfect. You don’t feel the wind cutting through you and when it rains or snows it keeps you dry.The quality is amazing and I highly recommend it for anyone that works outdoors and wants great quality, durability and warmth"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great coat Awesome buy no regrets.,5,"I love ❤️ it omg I bought so many jackets trying to find the right fit, we'll this jacket is high quality you can't go wrong. I bought a 2x for my Wife she's 5/11 at 120 pounds. She has a little belly in front, but it fit perfectly over it, with a little extra room, . I also bought one for me a 3x. I'm 5feet 6inches, & 270lbs. The coat fits perfectly. Now if I wanted to wear my wife's coat I could get a way with a 2x but I wouldn't have a whole lot of room for gaining weight or and extra sweat shot under my coat if I bought the 2x. But with the 3x I could where a wears hit under the 3x no problem. The 2x would be just a little tight especially if I'm bloated. Nonetheless is an awesome coat an awesome buy. I absolutely love it and she loves hers."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),IMO Runs larger than expected,3,"I like the jacket, its thicker that what it looks like on the model in the pic.  I wear everything in a Large, tshirst, work shirts and jacket and nicer dress shirts.  This run larger than a Large, I could wear a hoodie under this and still fit loosely.  Im gonna order a medium and then try it on and return one of them."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great minus cuffs,5,So I tried on a xxl before ordering this xl. I tried the xxl the only size available at a local store to know if I needed a xl or xxl based off how that fit.. now the Xxl was huge on me imo. The xlarge fits perfect. Enough room for a hoodie but without one also not super big just the right size.Only thing I dislike is the sleeve cuffs there super tight. Now the movement is excellent in this jacket over a active jacket especially for work usage. But the cuffs are a bit much def won’t get a draft in the sleeve.The Sherpa liner is nice and warm.. I doubt I’ll wear this much to break it in before warmer weather is here fully. But never know.All and all it’s a great jacket if your looking for a better looking less work looking jacket for going out but still need that carhartt quality for your money.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Leaves me wanting,3,"Day 1: Recieved the large Tall jacket and quickly tried it on due to other reviews about odd oversized areas.  Sleeves are long, about 6 inches longer than the extra Large Tall Yukon Carhartt I bought in 2011... I definitely won't have to worry about the sleeves pulling down when I'm working over my head...not that it was an issue with my old one... Sleeves aren't very big around and the cuff is kind of odd but it still fits.  Outside hand pockets are lined, but it is some sort of super thin fleece. Reminds me of the microfiber shirts back in the 90s..just thinner. Inner pockets are okay. Not as deep as my Yukon, and the right inner pocket has a vertical zipper that is going to take some getting used to. Chest pockets are okay but the double pocket on the right side is open up top with just a velcro patch to hold it closed and I'm expecting it to fill with water during the next good rain.  The zipper is brass but much smaller than the Yukon. Hopefully I won't have issues with it.  The lining leaves something to be desired. For sherpa it's not overly soft, but it is warm. However the fibers are already starting to shed. I can pull them from the material easily, and it's all over my shirt.  Outer shell seems like it's good quality, but you can get a cotton duck shell for much less.  Overall weight feels a bit heavier than the 10 year old Yukon."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Fits my long arms,5,"I'm 6'3 and slim, like really slim and was pretty hesitant to buy a medium tall but this jacket was a perfect fit (36/37 arm length over here). Only at the most extreme reach to I get movement in the cuffs but I bought this as a replacement as a daily jacket that I dont want to get dirty/destroy. Looks good in grey and I feel like if I took care of it I could get 10 years out of it, very solid jacket.This is the 2nd carhartt jacket Ive owned the other is a large tall (the get dirty jacket), different style but I can easily layer up in the large when working, take if off when in the shop. I do believe carhartt makes the best stuff in terms of craftsmanship/pricepoint with these jackets especially the big and tall sizes for guys with super long arms like myself."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Looks sharp. Nice cut,5,"Well worth money. It's very warm. I normally wear a medium and decided to go with a medium knowing that Carhart runs a little big. I can wear a long sleeve, tee and a hoodie with it and it feels very comfortable. The jacket seems to be very durable. I'm actually looking forward to cold days in Detroit 🤪"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Very nice coat,5,"This is a very nice coat. Typical Carthart product. Comfortable, stitched very well, seems to be very well made and really like the knit cuffs in the sleeves to keep out the cold. Love the liner too. Warm, soft and comfortable. I use this coat as a commercial electrician working outside or in structures where's there's no heat in winter. It's warm and allows easy full range movement too.  The only minor issue is it runs a little large. I normally wear an XL but this XL is somwhat larger than a ""normal"" XL. But I do wear layers under it so it works out fine for me."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great coat/Runs a bit big,5,"Great coat, warm, and definitely does the job! For reference, I’m 6’1”, 185-190lbs., 44” chest, 34”/35” waist with an athletic build and at the advice of a buddy who has the same coat and has the same build as me, he advised to get the Medium. I usually wear a L or XL in jackets/coats but I got the Medium (long) and it 100% fits perfect. I got the (long) only because I ride motorcycles and the reach comes in handy. You could even put a lightweight hoodie, sweatshirt, or flannel under it and still be good. If you don’t have long arms or don’t need the reach, a regular should be fine. Again, great coat, worth the purchase, going to last forever, but runs a little big."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),GREAT!,5,I am 6 ft and 200 lbs. I ordered a size MEDIUM because I’ve heard Carhartt runs big. I wear a large in shirts and jackets and 34/34 pants. This jacket fits me perfectly. In my opinion. I took some badly posed pics for reference of how I like a jacket to fit. If you like them more loosely fit then how mine fits then don’t size down. I hope this helps you decide what size to get. And the quality is obvious due to the name so I don’t think I should ramble about that.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Makes me feel like a man.,5,Before this jacket came into my life i was but a boy. The moment i slid my body into this bad boy i was transformed into a rugged working man with no time to waste. Except to write this review. I consider that day my new birthday. The day fat daddy was born and the old me died. Now im a big fat daddy with no time to deal with anything other then stacking cash and slammin... gosh i sure do love this jacket.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Perfect for thin guy,5,"My son loves this jacket. He is 5’11 and 145. Bought a small and it fits perfect. We tried other Carhartt jackets and they did not fit his body type. They are too tight at the waist, but when you go up a size they are too big at the shoulders and chest. So strange since he has a tiny 29 inch waist. This one was perfect though! Lots of great pockets too and very warm"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),The Best out there for a Working Jacket in moderate climates.,5,"This jacket is a classic, that Carhartt has continued to improve! The older style had a smaller zipper and no storm flap to cover it....so when it rained, especially blowing rain, could sometimes let water in. I have a 511 heavy duty jacket that cost north of 400.00, that is nowhere as rugged or comfortable as my Bartlett! I worked on the flight line at Robins for almost ten years out in the rain, sleet, snow, in Poland, and recently in Afghanistan.....had my trusty Carhartt jacket with me as always. I'm on my fourth carhartt.....usually wear them for a couple of years and donate them to the needy and pick up another new one. You cannot go wrong with one of these!!"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great buy,4,Fit as expected! But the picture was misleading a bit on style carhartt patch was black but it is actually the original carhartt color logo. Otherwise it’s a great jacket very warm
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),"Fit, material, style, warmth, roomy, durability, color",5,"I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!!! He works at a Steel Mill so he definitely needs something warm and tough. The color is awesome (including the hardware, zipper & buttons). Color is exactly what's in the photos. Maybe a tad darker.  It's Sherpa lined in the back and chest area. Super nice and roomy. Flexibility throughout the shoulder blade area, internal pockets, it's perfect fit! You can't go wrong with this one. What are you waiting for? Go ahead and press ""BUY NOW"". LOLP.S. Some people say Carhartt apparel is more on country side. My husband is more on the tactical side and this style fits him perfectly.I hope my review was helpful."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),"Tough, comfortable jacket",4,"Exactly what I thought I'd be getting in terms of a Carhartt jacket. My primary complaint is levied against the fit. The torso is short on me. The jacket stops at my belt. The arms however, are pretty daggum long. For reference, I'm 6' 0"", 210, with a 44"" chest. The jacket is nice and warm and I have no concerns about longevity. I use it as my outdoor chores jacket (wood splitting, fire building, grilling, running the dogs, campsite inspection etc.). I do really enjoy the sherpa lined hood. Feels nice if it's cold and I'm not wearing a hat. I was comfortable wearing it at 0 deg F with a flannel shirt underneath and gloves."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Quality expected from Carhart!,5,"Purchased this coat for my son who's tall and slim. He needed something for our cold CNY weather and this was perfect! Not too heavy, although a bit stiff when when first worn. This is to be expected tho, until the item is washed a couple of times. The quality is exactly as expected from Carhart and he really likes the shape of the coat (a bit longer in the back). The look of the coat when wearing is long and slender, vs a bit bulky, when wearing one of the Carharts with the elastic band at the bottom. Very happy with the purchase and would recommend. Medium Long fit my son perfectly. He is 5' 11"" and around 125lb."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),It's cozy!,5,"I purchased the medium tall size and it fits great (6'1"", 190 lbs).  It's not too tight and not too loose--it allows the warm air to stay where it should stay and keeps the cold air out, while still allowing me room to move around doing chores and such.  The jacket is great for outdoor projects in the cold, just what I've come to expect with the other Carhartt gear I own.  It appears to be made very well and I expect it to last a long time."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great jacket! Get a tall,5,"This jacket is extremely perfect for cold weather. I would recommend it 100%. However, I’m 6’1 186lbs and normally wear a large in t-shirts. I would definitely recommend getting a size tall for longer length and if you like a tighter fit get a size down. A large was too loose."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),the almost perfect jacket,5,"the almost perfect jacket, if they added a snap around the neck it would be perfect, in high wind the hood prevents the neck from closing all the way so i wear a balaclava or a scarf to prevent that from happening; its a real problem. other then that this is my second one and i LOVE it. first one lasted about 4 years for me but im out side climbing buildings and using lifts year round for a living so hard use. this jackets the cats pj's except for the neck."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Maybe someone with no shoulders and a big belly,2,"Super odd fit. My husband has an athletic build, it was tight across the chest and shoulders massive around the belly, sleeves were long. Quality was exactly as you expect from Carhartt products, tough material, well made, just an odd fit"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),"Very tough, very heavy",4,I like how tough it is and that it's washable. My large dogs like to jump up on me and have put lots of holes in my down jacket.The large was too big. I returned it and bought a medium locally so I could make sure it fit.I like the utility of the Carhartt but I don't like how heavy it is. I still wear my down jacket now because of the weight of the Carhartt. And the Carhartt is not as warm.But that's not the Jacket's fault. It's a good jacket. Just too heavy for me.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),I wear a Larger unless it's Carhartt. Then it's a medium,5,"Carhartt runs a bit big. in Tee's I wear an XL and most other shirts and jackets a Large. With Carhartt I wear a medium. It feels rugged and it is warm. I am disappointed to see all the single stitching. There is some triple stitching across the shoulder, over the chest, and down the side. Pockets and the bottom seam are single stitch. I am worried about how well they will hold up to welding, grinding and torching."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Maybe he’ll gain some more muscle to fill it out better.,5,"My husband bought this jacket because his father praised Carhartt. He seems to like it, but should have gotten a smaller jacket. He said he’ll keep it since he’ll be wearing layers underneath as it’s not exactly the warmest jacket. It’s a thick and heavy jacket, but the cold still gets through. Maybe he’ll gain some more muscle to fill it out better from all the wood he’s cutting in it."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Met expectations,5,"After reading the numerous reviews regarding fit issues, I was apprehensive about the product. However, while I've never bought Carhartt jackets, I decided to take a chance due to the products reputation. While I can't comment on the durability, the fit of XL is perfect for me (5'11"", 228#). Very comfortable, not overly warm, fit and finish as expected. Glad I made the purchase."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Tradition of a great brand!,5,This was a present for my daughter.  My husband and dad already had these jackets.  They are exceptionally awesome.  Warm and the fit is great.  They all rave about them especially for outdoor working or just hanging out.  Carhartt is an incredible brand. Tough and well made.  My Dad’s has last way over twenty years and my daughter’s new one is well built just like her Grandfather’s.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great product but Tall version is VERY TALL.,5,"Warmest jacket I’ve ever owned. Super high quality and comfort. I recommend ordering smaller than you might think to. I’m 6 2 and 215 lbs. I originally ordered a L T but when I got it, it was ridiculously too large. I returned it for a M T which fits much better however it is still quite long in the sleeve and at the waist. I prefer it that way but be weary of ordering a Tall size. 6 2 and would be just fine in a normal medium"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Must buy now,5,"Wow is all I have to say, I am glad I pulled the trigger and bought this jacket. Well under $200 you can't do better. My only complaint is I wanted dark brown and at the time they were out. Bought 2xlt in grey."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Warm and Durable,5,This coat seems to run a little on the large side but fits pretty well. I bought to replace an older Carhartt jacket which lasted me about 20 years before it wore out. It has a very good range of mobility for working and also will keep you comfortable in just about any season you'd regularly wear a jacket. Definitely recommended!
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),I want to buy another one for a spare!!,5,"I’m 5’9” - 250lbs and bought an XL and fits perfect.  I have a problem with jackets being too long as i am a bigger guy and short, but this jacket fits perfectly below the waste. I had my doubts that the material maybe not made strong or hems being weak but i was wrong. Hey you put this jacket on and you feel nothing but quality."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great Carhartt quality with room to layer,5,"I bought this as a work jacket the get dirty with working on vehicles and woodsplitting in the cold. It is very warm and the fleece interior is nice. It is slightly larger than I thought but now I can layer in a fleece or lightweight jacket underneath in really cold temps. I'm 5'10 165lbs with 33-34"" sleeve length and I bought the Large."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Short for a tall size,3,"I have two other Carhartt jackets and length has never been an issue, until this jacket. It is short. Real short. I am a big 6'8"" so tall sizes are necessary, but I would expect jackets to at least come to my belt line. This jacket did not."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Nice jacket!,5,"I got this for Christmas. It’s a very nice jacket. A heavy, sturdy feel like you’d expect from Carharrt. Plenty warm enough for me, though I’m in Ohio - you might need to layer a bit in more northern climates. 3x tall Fits me well at 6’1’ 245lbs but I like coats to be loose. I would definitely buy this jacket again."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Way too big!  Swimming in a tent!,3,"Returned item.  Product sized right for every dimension, except around the waist:  I'm a lean guy and this coat basically felt like being in a tent or cone.  Coat must be designed for big-bellied Americans!Nice coat, but had to return it!  No such offering for a 'large, thin' coat..."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Perfect,5,Great Carhartt quality. Very warm. I live 6500 feet up in mountains with snow and frequent below freezing temperatures. Comfortable with just a t shirt and the jacket. Looks great too :)
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Way oversized with tiny wrist-holes! Trust me!,3,"I'm very tall and athletic built and I wear large to extra large in everything. I figured getting large-tall would work for me but boy was I wrong. This thing is HUGE. I can't imagine anyone wearing it who is lighter than 250lbs, and that's just for the large size! The worse and ironic issue is that the sleeves are huge with a tiny tiny opening for your wrist, feels like a blood pressure cuff, completely unwearable with a watch or in cold weather where you need good hand circulation. Baffled by the 5-star reviews here"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great for a big guy,5,I got this for my husband who is a size 4x.  The jacket is wonderful.  I had ordered a 4x to start with.  It was a little short so we reordered a 4xlt.  This worked way better.  The 4xlt was a way better fit.  If your guy has a big belly definitely go for the xlt option.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Super warm,5,Got this for my husband for his trip back East... he said it was a great fit he loves it. Keeps him super warm and didn’t even need it buttoned or zipped up!
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Very warm . Great pockets.,5,"Can't go wrong with a good Carhart.  So nice , I hate to beat it up at work."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Checks every box!,5,"I really can't say enough about this jacket. Perfect on every level. Extremely warm, looks good, and fits great.. Room for layering, or looks and feels good wearing by itself. Love the amount of pockets too. I'm about 5'9, 165lbs and the medium was perfect."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),"Great Jacket, don’t expect to layer up!",5,"I am 5’7’’ 150lbs and ordered a small. It’s everything I wanted it to be except for the sleeves and arm hole band being to tight and small to be able to layer up with a sweatshirt or hoodie. The body size is good for layering but I need my hands to retain blood flow so I can work using fine motor skills. Wish things were a little different, other than that, great jacket"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great Jacket - Zipper Hard To Start,4,"This is a great jacket. The only concern is the Zipper which is small for this type of work jacket. It was hard to start but now works fine after breaking it in a bit. I might investigate having a larger YKK zipper installed - and would probably still be worth it as the jacket is not that expensive. Everything else is great. Good pockets including two inside. Material is softer (not as crispy) as other Carhartt jackets I've had in the past. Maybe it won't last as long - we'll see. Otherwise, happy with the purchase."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Too big,2,"The large was way to large for my husband. Sleeves were long prolly unsafe to woek in and body was wide.He is 6"" 165 lbs and we returned for a different style and color. Gray seemed like it would get dirty easily.Satisfied with size Med in a different style charhartt jacket."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),I love this jacket!!,5,"I am an athletic build, 6"" and 200 pounds. I bought a medium and it fits me perfectly. It is super warm and comfortable. Feels like it will last a lifetime. I highly recommend this jacket0"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Wear it to work or out on the town,5,"Just as expected from Carhartt. Sturdy, warm, fits as expected. Very well made fabric. One thing I really like, and the reason I bought it, is that you can wear it to work or out on the town. I expect this to last many many years like other Carhartt jackets I own."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Typical Carharrt quality,4,"I own and have used for the past 14 year, the predecessor model to this jacket.  They removed the small, slash zippered pocket on the front, which I miss.  My only concern, and reason I do not give this product 5 stars, is the main zipper.  It was formerly big, beefy and metal.  The new zipper is small, plastic and hard to use."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Not as good as my 10yr old Carhart coat.,2,"After owning a Carhart coat for 20 years I have decided to get a new one because I was very happy with the 1st one. Well I'm not too happy with this new coat, it's not as warm and seems to be not as heavy duty."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Very nice and warm,5,"Bought this for my dad. He’s 6”5 and weighs 239. Fits him as he likes it, comfortably"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),"Very heavily constructed, very warm and built to last",5,"This product is built to last and provides great warmth. It also is very nice looking. If you want a quality jacket that will last years and looks great, look no further. I considered many other jackets and am glad that I settled on this brand and style. Highly recommend."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Love it!!,5,"Love this jacket, perfect color and love the Sherpa lining. Being able swing my arms around and not having the whole jacket move with it is an amazing feeling. If you have experience with other carhartt jackets you understand. So yeah.. love it!"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Solid Carhartt quality.,5,"Like the look, can't wait for it to get colder to wear it more. Only gripe is I went off their size chart and had to exchange for a larger size. I know they say it's sized with layers in mind, but there ain't no way that would've worked for me, but I am getting old and fat, so it's probably more a issue on my end. Not bulky like the older carhartts. Happy with the purchase."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Absolutely Perfect!,5,I got my husband his first Carhartt this year for Christmas. He LOVES it! The quality is perfect and it keeps him nice and toasty. I went with the chocolate brown and it's very nice. It goes with everything. I know this jacket will survive for many years to come.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Warm and Comfortable/Great Gift!,5,"Got this for my husband as an early Christmas present. He loves it and claims that it is the warmest and most comfortable jacket he has ever owned. He loves to go camping and hunting in very cold temperatures and this jacket will be perfect for that. He is 5’10-5’11, 200-210lbs and I got him the size Large and it fit him perfectly."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Perfect.,5,"Made to perfection, and the 2nd Carhartt I've purchased in 10 years, and still wearing the 1st. The buttons along the zipper and the wide collar, as well as the ""Full Swing"" design of the shoulder; really makes this jacket. This is definitely the best mid-weight Carhartt jacket."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),"Roomy, sturdy and cozy",5,"I bought a large for my husband who is 6' and about 220 and it fits great. I expected it to be roomy because it's 1) designed to work in outdoors and 2) other reviews, and it meets expectations. He could wear it over a hoodie or flannel and move around freely. He loves it!"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Best coat ever.,5,Super warm. Fits nice with room to breath or add layers. I ordered a xl and a large. Ended up keeping the large. Love that the arms are long and the back doesn’t ride up. And super functional with all the pockets
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Maybe not a work jacket...,4,"I love this jacket, however its not functionally what I was looking for out of a carhartt. I work outside and the impending winter season is upon us and I was looking for a warm jacket to help brave the weather. This jacket is warm,  but not quite enough once it gets down to single digits. It might be able to work with layers under neath but you will need to size up. I'm 5'6 at abt 175 lbs and a medium is a snug fit. Its a very aesthetically nice jacket that I will use for outtings but I will going with a different jacket for work."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),WARM and worth the money,5,I ordered this a size bigger than needed so I can fit a hoodie under it on very cold days. It is very warm and built well I've only had to add a sweatshirt once when it was 5° out and mildly windy
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Exactly what you want,5,This coat fits awesome full stretch the coat don’t ride up my arms!!!! I’m 6’2 200lbs so not big so I got medium tall can’t do lg carhartt runs  big can’t wait for winter prolly order few more to put away but remember if ur a large order a medium in carhartt
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Still good quality,3,"It is great quality, but a slightly different jacket than the one in the photo.  It does not have the Carhart Black Lable, and it is not stone washed like the one in the photo."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Nice thick jacket,5,"Wonderful thick jacket. Perfect for the winter. I am normally a large, ordered a medium tall and it was the perfect fit with some room for comfort. I'm 5'11"" and 170 pounds."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),"Fits big, so order a size down",5,"II originally ordered a large, but it was WAY too big in the shoulders for my soon-to-be son-in-law.  I ordered a medium and it fit much better.  Luckily, I was able to give the size large to my son who's a bigger guy.  The coat isn't long, comes about 4 inches below the waist.  Very heavy, very warm.  I like that the coat looks a little nicer/dressier than the standard Carhartt jackets."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Brand stayed the same,4,"I bought this coat for my son for Christmas.He originally had another style Carhartt coat that was beat up after many many years of wearing. Although this jacket didn't have the fitted bottom like his old one and it seemed a bit small to be a 2 X, he liked it and also had the option of a pull string inside the coat  to gather it at the bottom.  The coat overall was very nice"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Large jacket with sleeves made for a small child.,1,"I ordered a LARGE. It fit okay in the chest and shoulders, but the sleeves were nearly two inches too short.  Looked like SMALL sleeves on a LARGE jacket.  Returned it and ordered a LARGE TALL.  Don't know yet how that one will work because the vendor (Dungarees) hasn't shipped it yet after 2 WEEKS!"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Good Fit,5,"My son needed a winter jacket.  This fit the bill.  Machine washable, warm and in style.  He is 6'2"" and 230 lbs.  A large tall fit the bill.  Carhardt products are built to last and this jacket is no exception."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Size down for a better fit,5,"Pros: Great jacket for cold weather, and super durable like all carhartt products. Lots of pocketsCons: leaves a lot of fuz on your clothes when you first wear it. Like most carhartt clothes they run a size or two too big.Fit: I’m 220/5’11” muscular build and I got a medium tall and it fits perfect, not too tight and not loose. I usually wear XL in other brand tshirts  but a medium across all carhartt products."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great jacket,5,Love this jacket. Have wanted a new one for awhile had my last carhart for years passed it down to my nephew. Great product
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),"I’m 5’9, 160 lbs and the small fits like a glove",5,The small fits perfect and I still have room to layer underneath but a medium would have worked if you prefer a looser fit. It’s carhartt so you know what to expect quality wise. I just hope this helps someone find the right size. Good luck
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great Buy!,5,"This jacket is great! My husband works outside a lot and during this time of year in Upstate NY, it's a bit chilly. He always swears by Carharrt so this was a no-brainer. It's that classic durable material so I know he won't be destroying it anytime soon. It has several pockets for all of his various things and blocks the wind out wonderfully. He loves it."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Good,5,I baught it for a work jacket and its pretty close to becoming my everyday its warm and if i wear a hoodie underneath i cant even tell
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Exactly what I expected!,5,"Exactly as described.comfortable,warm,durable and typical carhartt. Definitely worth the price and will last many many years."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Not what I expected,3,Weird fit mid section is really wide and poofy but everything else fits the way it should. Large is too small on 6'3 185 lb man.XL is the size we went with for arm length and broad shoulders.Seems okay for warmth but not as thick and fluffy ad expected
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Good,5,Good fit very warm 2XLT6
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Carhartt quality you can trust,5,Worn Carhartt clothing for years. This is one of the best Carhartt jackets I have ever had
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Pass on this seller.,1,Seller obviously selling seconds for full price. Received item and could barely get my hands through the cuffs. Extremely tight. I currently own this same jacket in a different color that I bought at a store... It should not be this tight in the cuff area. Almost broke my watch trying to put it on !!!
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Stylish work jacket,5,Really love this for a casual jacket around town! My husband uses it when working outside or in the garage now instead of just wearing an old kind of worn out coat.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),The trouble with tribbles,3,"Had a bit of chemical odor when I got it. Ran it through the delicate cycle on the washing machine. This is when I realized that horse blanket lining is superior to sherpa lining. Out of the wash, sherpa shed was all over the jacket and the dryer lint filter looked like a tribble. Different lining would add a star."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great jacket,5,"Bought a medium. Fits perfect. High quality, will update if anything changes."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Perfect fit!,5,Loving this jacket!Glad I took the chance on it.Keeps me warm and looks great on

Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Worth the money,5,"Coats never fit me right. I went on Carhartt's website and answered some questions and was told to get a 2xl. I figured it would be to short in the body or arms or too long etc. But no, it fits me perfect. It looks cool and it is nice and comfy. I finally get the hype behind these."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Carhart never disappoints!,5,"Purchased this coat as a gift for my husband. He loves it. His only complaint is the front pockets being different than his last carhart. You can’t just put your hands in the pockets at a natural angle, but he is getting used to them. Tough, warm, durable, classic!"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),"Great purchase, great gift, great value, great brand!",5,"Very impressed with this jacket.

Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),It's built tough,5,The elastic cuffs are a little tight. It may be because of my xxl hands.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Love the style!,5,Can't wait to wear it to work.  (at the airport) It should help keep me warm.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Poor craftsmanship,3,The coat is just what I wanted but the zipper was not sewn in properly so it takes 5 minutes just to work it around so I can zip it up. I figured if I wore a little it would loosen up.  It did not. Now the zipper comes apart sometimes.  I am very disappointed since now I have missed the return window.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Solid work jacket.,5,"I like my Carharrtts, they are warms and solid."

Would buy again and highly recommend!
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Keeps you warm on those bone chilling windy days,5,I have worked outside for 13 years and this is the warmest jacket I have every used. Yes it is a bit expensive but if you work outside daily it is money well spent. I wish I would have bought one years ago. I probably would have saved a lot of money by just buying one of these instead of the many other brands I have tried.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),"Good fit, nice look.",5,"I purchased the jacket for my teenage grandson.  It's well made, fits him just right.

Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Bartlett Jacket,5,It’s a great jacket; keeps you warm and you look good in it.

Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Made to last,5,"A beautifully made jacket. It definitely has some quality.

Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Worth the investment.,5,The jacket fits perfectly for me. I went with the black one. The color is fairly normal denim black. Hasn't faded so far after several washes. The fit is perfect for me. I'm 5ft 9in at 140lbs with an athletic/muscle-ish build. This thing will keep you very warm by the way. It's got good weight to it and might be a bit bulky feeling for some.

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,"Water Resistent, not WATERPROOF",1,"I ordered the ""Tommy Hilfige Men's WATERPROOF Breathable Hooded Jacket"" 

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket, Charcoal, XL

   because the product description CLEARLY states that the jacket is ""WATERPROOF"".When the jacket arrived, I opened the package and found a tag CLEARLY stating that the jacket is ""WATER RESISTANT"".I ordered an XL which fit fine, but I have no idea if the jacket is warm because I didn't bother to try it out before I sent it back!!!I for one don't like to be lied to!!Also, If color matters to you Tommy Hilfiger's idea of ""Charcoal"" is far different than mine!! Charcoal is dark gray/black, the jacket I was sent was blue.This is a clear case of Product Misrepresentation!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,NOT WATERPROOF AS STATED!,1,"Item description clearly states WATERPROOF, tag on delivered item clearly states WATER RESISTANT ........... those are two very different things!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Not waterproof,2,"Pretty nice, thin jacket. The hood is HUGE. Like, I can't see when it's up. I need to wear a hat under the hood when it's raining which is annoying. And, of course, it's not waterproof like the description says it is. It clear says it's ""water resistant"" on the tag. Big difference. Of course, I know there are really no jackets this lightweight that are truly waterproof, but overall disappointing. For a water resistant jacket, it's pretty nice, if you don't have to put the hood up. I get hot easily, and this one seems fairly cool."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Nice jacket for price,4,"I am a tall female so i usually wear mens jackets for the arm length and upper body length. I ordered a medium and im glad I did. (5""9 weigh 140) The fit was roomy not tight but the jacket is thin.  I didnt want a puffer or bulky coat. This jacket is good for layering underneath. The length comes to middle of butt."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Very nice for the money,4,"I'm 5'7"", 155 pounds and a small fit perfectly. It's comfortable and perfect over a sweater/t-shirt combo. Nice hood with a drawstring and includes a drawstring around the waist to keep wind from blowing under.My only problem is that the zipper jams a lot. However, I had a nearly identical Columbia jacket that I lost and this one is nicer even with the troublesome zipper. Nicer lining, better fit, and a little better looking IMO.It's not waterproof - duh, you don't get waterproof for $50 - but it will keep you reasonably dry if you're briefly in light rain as I often am (I live in a city neighborhood and my car is usually a short walk to a public parking space).I live in Chicago where you get lots of variable weather and this jacket is perfect for the in-between seasons when the temp varies from 40 to 60 degrees."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Awesome.  I bought this in 2 colors and sizes.,5,"I'm 6'1 175lbs and I bought a large in yellow.  It fit slim but perfect.  I bought an extra large in navy & blue.  It fit larger all around and gave room for a fitted jacket and sweater underneath.  The seams, cut and finish are excellent.  The zipper is protected with a velcro system.  The hood is perfect.  I haven't tried it in heavy rain yet.  This is a thin waterproof shell that won't keep you warm in deep cold without layers. Overall awesome."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Dry in pouring rain.,4,"I like this jacket. I just wore it for the first time in a driving windy rainstorm, and remained dry underneath. It's lightweight and well ventilated with an adjustable hood. It has two outer zipper pockets but no inner pockets. An inner breast pocket for a phone would be very nice, and for $40 you would think it would have one or two. I'm 6'2"", 190 and ordered a large, which was Way too tight. The XL is perfect"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,not as described,1,"advertised as ""waterproof""  ...Is NOT the tag  states otherwise!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,"It looked great, and fit well",3,"Not sure if I got a dud, but mine leaked water through the seam where the hood attaches.  Probably wouldn't have been a problem for light rain, but would've been a problem for heavy rain.  It looked great, and fit well.  I would've kept it if it wasn't for this problem."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,"With Exception of a ""Loophole,"" It's Perfect",5,"Good quality, good fit and overall good product!Now that said- I want to add a mini rant/observation about jackets in general-How many jackets do you own, that came with that little loop sewn into the back inside collar,  so that you could hang that jacket from the loop, on a hook?Now how many of those jackets that you own, (that have that loop) and the loop is now broken, making the former loop, unusable?For me, almost all my jackets that came with that loop, are broken, including this one. It took only the second use of this jacket, for an unintentional slight tug on the jacket (while hanging on a hook by that loop), for the loop to break... which makes me think, that it's a (literal) jacket maker ""loophole"" conspiracy, that all these loops are meant to easily break and frustrate the jacket owner. I suppose a broken loop is better than a torn jacket, but whatever... Rant over ;-)"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Small aint what it used to be!,3,"As the average weight of Americans has increased and fit preferences have evolved to ""loose,"" meaning large enough to accomodate the girth, manufacturers have simply changed the sizing accordingly, so a ""small"" today is really the old medium, and in some cases, what used to be a large. Makes it difficult for people of smaller stature to find clothing that fits. I am 5'2"" and weigh 105, and this windbreaker fits like a medium or medium-large. It's nicely made, and I like the pockets but don't like the drawstring around the bottom. The hood, of course, like the rest of the garment is too big and covers the eyes. I wish Amazon Essentials would give us an extra small windbreaker. Their XS mens shirts are an excellent fit for me."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,The jacket repels the rain and breathes well.,4,"This only got four stars because the color is not as pictured.  It is a dark mustard yellow, not a brightly visible yellow as depicted.  I wanted this for bicycling.  Rain in hot weather means wearing a plastic jacket that doesn't breathe and creates a lot of perspiration.  This breathes well everywhere except the sleeves.  On a hot day with a pop up thunderstorm, I stayed dry except for my forearms which did begin to sweat.  I'm keeping the jacket because of price and performance, but the color is NOT close to what is pictured.  I will have to wear a reflective vest over this for increased visibility."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,NOT A WATERPROOF JACKET - BE CAREFUL,1,Since 2016 customers are writing reviews about this product that it is not waterproof. But the seller hasn't any actions to change the product specification. In 2020 the product I received is water resistant as per the company tag and not waterproof. Always perform an research before buying any product in Amazon.
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Nice jacket,4,"I bought this for my almost 14 year old. He wears a medium in men’s and that’s what I ordered , he loves the coat and wears it all the time . The zipper was a cause for worry for me it not the nicest zipper I was afraid it would break ,  but so far so good and my son is notorious for breaking zippers. I bought one in red , that’s the one my son has been using . I bought the black for my Marine son, I haven’t sent it to him yet , the zipper on the black one is worse than the red one , I am still on the fence if I’m going to return it ."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,can't get the order right  !!!!!!  twice  !!!!  :(,1,"couldn't say anything about this jacket other than it looks nice.  two times I ordered an XXL and both times they sent me a Large  :(  the sleeve tag showed the XXL  size along with the outer package, however both times the jacket was a Large as indicated by the fact it would NOT fit and the tab on the inside of the jacket showed it to be a largesomebody is NOT DOING THEIR JOB  !!!!!!!!!!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,"Great Jacket, Velcro is Annoying",4,"I bought this jacket for a trip to New Zealand and it did it's job great. The fit was perfect and it didn't get too hot or muggy inside the jacket. The only problem with it is the velcro going up the zipper. You have to individually undo the velcro strips in order to unzip it, even if you never pressed the velcro down. I guess it shows how effective the velcro is, but it's just an annoying step you need to take to get the jacket off when the velcro really isn't adding much beyond the zipper. Other than that, it's great."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Sweat Box,1,"This jacket does NOT breath, at all. After 10 minutes of wearing this, even on the coldest of days, your arms and torso will be drenched in sweat, and you will immediately begin to stink like yogurt."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,I love it. Can't wait to see wear it out in public.,5,This is probably one of the best jacket I ever bought it fit perfect buy your size I bought it really braggy because that how I wear my clothes... It's really the best. The only thing I didn't like was that in the picture it looks really bright white but it's not it's beige and gray.... The only down part was that I was looking for a bright white one. It's ok it still a really nice jacket. I like it so much I bought one in yellow too.
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,My new favorite,5,"I like the ""ice"" color, a light grey shade that contrasts nicely with the darker grey lining.  For added waterproofing, I sprayed it with ScotchGard waterproofing (another Amazon find, of course).  I wore it for the first time this morning when there was a heavy downpour.  The raindrops just bounced off the jacket."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Hubby Loves this Raincoat,5,"Bought this for my hubby. He loves Everything about it. Enough that he willingly threw out his older one (35 y. o.!)He's broad-shouldered; the raincoat is roomy W/OUT being bulky or boxy. And, its of a Lighter Weight than mine, but also rugged."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,The Poor Zipper Closed out the Deal,1,"I just returned the jacket. The problem was the zipper was a piece of junk! It split almost immediately, and would never stay closed. I am disappointed because it looked like a nice quality jacket. Sorry!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Snug but overall i'm happy.,4,"I'm 5' 6"", the small fits perfectly in the arms, waist and length from top to bottom. It's a little tight in the chest around to my back when zipped due to my stocky build. If you're not stocky and more on the slim side small is perfect. If you have a stocky muscular build you might need to go with a medium.As for the garment it's well made, wind and waterproof are top-notch."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Las medidas en la tabla de tallas no coinciden con lo comprado,1,"Compre la chaqueta Tommy hilfiger y cuando me la fui a poner me quedo super grande revise las medidas de la chaqueta y no coincidian con las medidas publicadas por el vendedor. Para el caso del pecho la chaqueta mide 125 cm y no 105cm como se muestra en la talla. Es decir de pecho la chaqueta realmente mide 49.21 inches y no 41 inches.Para el caso de la cintura la chaqueta mide 125 cm y no 105cm como se muestra en la talla. Es decir la cintura de la chaqueta realmente mide 49.21 inches y no 41 inches.Para el caso de largo de mangas la chaqueta mide 67.5 cm y no 86.36cm como se muestra en la tabla. Es decir de largo de mangas la chaqueta realmente mide 26.51 inches y no 34 inches.Por lo anterior, solicito la devolución del dinero porque yo compre una chaqueta con medidas diferentes a lo ofrecido."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Waist not really adjustable or flexible - tight,2,"I’m  a little under 6 foot, 240 lbs —XL is more like a medium- so this is for those with a slimmer build and not so much for the stouter build. They need to make more rainwear that is flexible and with stretch features- especially at the waist. Going back."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Great Jacket - Great Fit For Him!,5,My hubby loves this jacket! It is light weight and a perfect fit. He is 5’5” at 170lbs and I ordered a large for him.
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Nice jacket,4,"Nice jacket. Material used is pretty good, unlike those thin trashbag material.Size is  true to fit. But if you are thinking of layering, definitely get a size up.  I am 1.8m n weighs 90kg, got a xxl n it's great for layering.As I've yet to test it in the rain, I'm giving it 4 stars for now"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,👍🏽👍🏽Tommy you saved the rainy day.,5,"I bought this jacket for my husband bc where we live when it rains it pours for months. He needed a raincoat for his job. Everything about this jacket is wonderful. It’s comfy, stylish and fits perfectly."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,"Great Jacket, Does the Job",5,I like the look and feel of this jacket. I got try it out in the rain for about 4 hours and it held up well. Light weight with good pockets and a great hood. Would buy again.
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Advertised as waterproof but the actual products says water repellant,1,It says waterproof but the actual product says otherwise. It only water repellant.
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Comfortable jacket for fall/spring,5,"Great lightweight, water-resistant windbreaker for spring/fall weather. I often get overheated in a normal jacket when working outside so this was perfect. Size fit me as expected."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,This jacket is NOT waterproof,1,"I did not like the fact that it clearly states that this jacket is WATERPROOF.  I received it today and the tags clearly state it is water RESISTANT.  That is not what was promised in Amazon's listing and is not what was advertised!  Fit was ok, but quality of seams is poor and will most likely leak. I am not please that this product will have to be returned."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Nice fit,5,"Nice quality jacket, it’s lightweight enough to wear between seasons, but also insulated well if you wear something warm under it during the cold weather."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,This jacket is beautiful. I wanted a lightweight windbreaker for a Summer ...,5,"This jacket is beautiful.  I wanted a lightweight windbreaker for a Summer trip to the Midwest and, as I searched on Amazon, decided to add water-resistance, too.  The Hilfiger fits nicely (I ordered a large), but it's a bit heavier (although still lightweight) than I had imagined. It feels very solid and well-made.  I would definitely buy it again."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,OK,5,Ii can wear some things in large.  I ordered extra large and that fit nicely. Loos good zipper doesnget caught in surrounding material.
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Item in the picture is different than what I ordered,3,This Jacket is very nice and made extremely well but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because the listing picture is different than what we purchased. It doesn’t have a grey lining in the photo which is what I really liked about this particular rain jacket. But for a rain jacket it’s excellent quality
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Great looking foul weather jacket.,5,"Love the jacket. Received comments from others about how much they like it. Wore the jacket with hood up during severe rain storm, kept me dry and comfortable.. Great design."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Great product,5,As advertised. True to size. I got a mosquito trap's sticky substance all over one of the sleeves and during the time it took to wash it off under running water i was very impressed that the inside of said sleeve was completely dry. Haven't been able to test in the rain yet but i am encouraged. For 40 bucks it is practically a steal imo.
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Tag and jacket say different sizes,2,"I bought this for my 18 year old who is working in a camp in Pennsylvania. Had it shipped there. He ordered a small. Bottom line is, Jacket is big. Turns out that the tag says small but the Jacket says large or x- large. Its hard for him to return it as he cant leave camp with all the restrictions and he'd be without a jacket. Not happy."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Not good quality.,3,"Not as advertised. First off, if you want white...forget about it. Ice color is actually a grey. Not at all like it looks online. Also it is so thin you can see you shirt through it. I returned it for full refund."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,"Nice looking, weather proof jacket!",5,Surprised my husband with this! He loved it! Its a great blue and orange color. Its very lightweight and fits him well.
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Tommy Hilfiger quality jacket,5,I’ve purchased Tommy Hilfiger clothing products in the past & this jacket is of the same consistent quality! Recommend it!
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Price tag size is XXL and the tag in the jacket is size L,1,"I bought this jacket and it arrived with the price tag saying XXL, which is the sized I ordered, but the tag on the actual jacket is a Large.  The jacket fits like a large, not a XXL.  I returned the jacket for this reason and received another jacket with the same problem.  In addition, the second jacket's zipper was very difficult to use.  It was difficult to move.  Very disappointed!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Lightweight and stylish,5,"Extremely lightweight and 100% waterproof. Adjustable hood, waist and cuffs. Zipper pockets but no pockets on the inside of coat"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Great jacket!,5,Excellent quality! This is a great price for this jacket. We ordered a rain jacket around Christmas and had paid double what we paid for this one. We sent the other back due to horrible quality. Was pleasantly surprised how great this one is!
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Very small,2,I ordered and received a jacket marked XL.  I can barely fit into it!
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Fresh and light,5,"I thought this could be only for rainy days, but no... this is for any col weather."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,"The ""white"" is not white...",3,"If you are looking for a white jacket (USA Swim Officials) don't pick this one.  The ""white"" option is actually a light gray that is not distinguishable from the photo.  Also, it is not waterproof, so you will be fine in a light sprinkle, but not outright rain."

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Good Fit But Not Waterproof,2,"My husband is 6'4"" with a beer belly.  Regular sizes are generally too short; tall sizes are too long.

He liked the fit but we returned it because the tag said it was water resistant...not waterproof like it was advertised."

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Warm and seemingly water proof,4,"Great material very good quality. The hood is small but I'm not overly concerned because it helps retain heat. The arms are long but the velcro band helps fit the sleeve to above my wrists. Otherwise good material but has not yet been tested in total downpour. The insulation is a double edged sword, it's warm but too warm for hot rainy days. I guess this is the side effect of the water proof exterior. The color is a classic dull rain jacket yellow but not bright. I was hoping for it to be a little more maize to represent better at UMich games but it'll do. Go blue!"

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Great,5,According to the expected
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Beautiful, thick, well made, great looking jackets..... but arms are way too narrow",4,"Here is the real deal with these jackets... From the good, the bad, to the unfortunate.The Good:The prices on Amazon for these jackets are amazing! The jackets are beautiful, well made, thick with sherpa insulation in the torso and plenty of thick insulation in the arms. The denim washes are consistent throughout the garment and look just like the pictures you see pictured online. In my opinion they are simply strong, well made, beautiful jackets. I love them.but....The Bad:The arms in these jackets run narrow, so if you have any sort of upper arm musculature they will be tight, too tight. This will force you into buying the next larger size jacket in order to increase the arm width (which is still snug but doable). The problem now is the jacket will be longer and wider in the torso... That's an issue because the jacket simply looks too big, wide, and long!The Solutions:1) Some folks have tried getting around this by buying the larger size, washing and drying in order to shrink the garment (because shrinkage mostly occurs in the length of the arms and torso and a little bit in width), then wear the garment to try and stretch out the denim. Remember it is denim so it will stretch quite a bit just like your jeans do... BUT there is no guarantee it will shrink enough in all the areas you want for a perfect fit..2) You pay a tailor to increase the upper arm width by sewing in extra denim fabric or stretch fabric...3) You go to Sears or a local Levis location and try on a dozen jackets to find one that fits you just right...4) You buy a vintage 70's, 80's, 90's pre-owned jacket which were cut larger in the arms back then...Point is this: If you are tall and slender with slender arms the jacket will fit. If you are overweight with thin arms the jacket will fit. If you are built with a keg like torso and stick like arms the jacket will fit.The Unfortunate:However... If you are athletic in any way and have average muscle size, medium muscles, larger muscles, or huge muscles the jacket will not fit your arms... period. The jacket will fit in the shoulders and the torso but not the arms. Can you see the recurring theme here?My solution:I tried both the large and the XL and neither fit my arms properly and were way too wide and long in the body. (Therefore I had to return them to Amazon.) Unfortunately I ended up going to a local retailer (paid way more than if purchased through amazon) tried on 20+ jackets, got lucky, and found something I could break in. I also bought another one (by going the vintage route via ebay) which worked out even better because they were made bigger and different back then.Great jackets but terrible fit. All Levis needs to do is increase the upper arm width by 1.5 inches in order to compensate for the extra insulation put there. This is why the Sherpa jackets have this sizing problem because the manufacturers are using the pre-existing un-insulated denim jackets as the base model, filling it up with sherpa and arm insulation and....boom....poor fitting jackets."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great jacket!,5,"Ok, so, for starters I'm a woman, ha. I really loved the style of this jacket but I was worried, based on reviews, that the women's version would be a bit too cropped on me, so I thought I would try the men's. I'm tall and thin - 5'9"" 143 pounds. I bought this jacket in a size Medium, which is the size that I would normally fit into in men's clothing. It fits perfectly on me, and falls right where I wanted it to - right about hip length. The sleeves go a little past my wrists, which kinda surprised me because I do have pretty long arms. However, I prefer my sleeves to be a bit longer so I'm happy about that. The upper arms are pretty roomy, though, because obviously this is made for men and I have virtually no upper body musculature, lol. I can see how these jackets might run a tad small for men because even with the little bit of extra room for me to move around in, it's still a very fitted jacket overall.I can layer thicker long sleeve shirts and thin sweatshirts underneath of it and still am able to button it up. But nothing too bulky. This jacket is surprisingly warm, though, thanks to the sherpa lining. The sleeves have a quilted polyamide/polyester lining - certainly not as warm as the body but still pretty decent. I really like the hidden pocket on the inside of the jacket - it's a good size for your phone or wallet. My only complaints, I guess, would be that I wish the front pockets had a sherpa lining as well to keep your hands warm. I'm also not a fan of the snap closure buttons. The color that I ordered - Mustard Blue Denim - is really nice in person and pairs well with darker jeans.Anyway, I think this is a great, warm, handsome jacket that would be well worth buying if you can figure out which size works best for you. I would suggest going with the size you would normally wear in jackets, and if that doesn't fit then try going up a size. Also, consult the size chart on the levi's website as it does seem to be fairly accurate, at least for the size that I bought."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great gift!,5,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and I figured I might as well model it for the review lol. He’s 5’8”, about 180 pounds, and his pant size is a 36X32. I got him the extra large after reading reviews that the arms were small and I’m glad I did because he’s a bit muscular in the arms. This is the same jacket that they’re trying to hock for 3 times the price at urban outfitters. For reference I’m 5’7” and 130 pounds and the color of the jacket bought is mustard blue. I might have to get a matching one for me the quality is super nice and I like the fit better than women’s."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,a plus size woman buying this coat.,5,"I am a curvy plus size woman.270lbs, 40F bra size, 5'6-ish in height..usually 2xl-3xl in woman plus/L-xl in menI enjoy being frugal but a fashionable individualI wear women and men clothing items/accessories and customize it to my own if need beSo when I saw this jacket awhile back I knew I had to have it but refused to pay Levis' price of a $125Luckily I spotted this jacket on the great Amazon in the women's version read a lot of the reviews on here and levi's website even the sizing chart and I realized I would be playing myself if I brought in the woman's or woman's plus so I decided to try it in the men's and saw that everyone from men and women saying this jacket runs small and they were not lying...I previously brought it in a xxl because I rather something be a little too big then too small and the arms felt good the jacket wasn't too long but at the same time I am very hippy with a big butt so nothing really goes pass my booty anyways hahahaIt felt ok around the midsection but could of been a little roomier but would not close on my chest so I returned it back and wanted to completely give up on the jacket because I was so excited to get it and greatly disappointed even thou I was buying bigger sizes in men that I knew that was too big for me but was completely confused why this jacket didn't fit right at all but something kept telling me to go for the 3xl which is the last size for this jacket and if it didn't fit I was over it! I exchanged for the 3xl and actually was able to get the color I wanted and it fitted perfectly but it's still a fitted jacket and it's suppose to fit tapered to the body with a little wiggle room.So with that being said I am letting you know right now that this style of jacket runs SMALL I say get a size up or two especially if you're on the plushy side if you're skinny or average you MIGHT be able to get away with your size but I recommend sizing up. I am from NY and our winters are pretty cold and with a nice thick hoodie/sweater and this jacket I was nice and warm but that's me...everybody is different.This jacket is super nice in person, I got the Turkish Brown and have received a lot of compliments so far even thou it's a men's jacket! So ladies don't hesitant to buy this item because it's a men's jacket as long as you know how to slay it and make it your own you can wear anything!xoxo"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Great fit - Surprisingly heavy, well made and really good for price",5,"I'm 6'1 165 lbs and this jacket (MEDIUM) is absolutely perfect. I have long arms and long legs, see how it fits in opicture. In terms of length this is what this style of Jacket is supposed to be. Very happy with the purchase. It was heavier than expected, which is honestly a great thing. Should work for weathers 50-55 degrees+. Anything colder than that you should get a heavier jacket. Also very comfy and soft on the inside."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Smaller than expected, still a good jacket",4,"I ordered this jacket in a medium thinking that it would be slightly oversized on me, since I am female and most men's clothing tends to run larger on me. Turns out that this jacket delivers a more fitted look, even at this size which really surprised me. The arms are a little stiff, there is just enough wiggle-room but I definitely need to wear this jacket in for a while for it to be comfier. When I button it up, the fit is more snug than I usually like but it's workable, it's just a bit weird because for me there is more room in the waist area but it's tighter around the bottom. This is only a first-impression review, but I do think this seems like a really good quality jacket. I love how the buttons are a snap closure, and I love the color as well, I got the mustard blue shade. I will say though, if you're a guy looking to order this jacket I would suggest ordering several sizes larger than what you are used to, if you don't want it to be too snug. Otherwise maybe just skip this one altogether. I was thinking about returning mine, but I've decided to keep it in hopes that the denim will stretch out a little more the longer I wear it. For reference I'm 5'5"" tall, about 130lbs and the length of this jacket goes down just below my hips, so for a taller person it would probably hit right at the hips or even above that. Overall if you're on the fence about this one like I was, I'd say give it a shot."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Looks Great. Fits Great. 6' Tall 175lbs,5,"I am 6' tall, 175 - 180lbs, 32"" - 33"" waist. I also have good sized arms. This jacket fits perfectly.If I were any heavier than about 185lb I'd say going a size up would be the right call.This jacket looks great and feels great. I'll wear it in south central Alaska Sept & Oct. Nov - Feb it will not be warm enough. A good looking jacket for Spring and Fall."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Love the jacket but extremely dissatisfied,1,"I love this sherpa jacket as far as fit, and style. Everything is perfect except 1 major flaw. I ordered the black sherpa and the jacket came packaged with an intense smell of dye. It reminds me of these cheap jean pants from anchorblue I wore when I was young that had the same bad smell to them . So I know the jacket shouldn't smell this way normally because the black sherpas in store don't smell like this, plus my girlfriend ordered the same exact version directly from the Levi's store and no scent on that one as well. I've tried washing them once and the smell improved just a tiny bit but still very strong and noticeable. I barely wear them now just hanging out on a chair near a window being aired out but no improvement. I don't really want to or should I even have to continously wash/treat the jacket to eliminate the smell at the cost of ruining it. I'm extremely dissatisfied with this purchase. Beware, if you want a dark colored sherpa just go to the levi store directly. I wanted to purchase another jacket in a different color until this happened. I will not be dealing with the amazon version ever again."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Misled and upset,1,"I am highly upset. I’ve been to multiple Levi stores and department stores for this specific jacket. However, at the stores the color is not mustard denim that is a lighter blue but a darker denim. On the amazon description and even the reviewers that post pictures, it also indicated the light blue mustard denim that I needed. I scanned every review and q+a to see if there was an updated inventory that changed the light blue mustard into a darker denim. There was not. Hence, I was misled to buy this jacket that was inaccurately advertised. I spent money, waited for delivery, just to be disappointed, and now it is of great inconvenience because I have to somehow come up with a last minute present or give the present as it is to my son who may be very unsatisfied. I am a big Levi supporter but this is a great disappointment ."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,The jacket fits fine. I was going to buy a size L,5,"So I'm a plus size woman. After reading the reviews on the female version of the jacket, i knew that i was not going to fit in one. One of the reviews suggested to buy a male version of the jacket. Which is what I did. The jacket fits fine. I was going to buy a size L, but based on the review i went up a size. The jacket feels just right. The only downside I have is the broad shoulders. The jacket does not curve on my shoulders, its more like a squared look."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Amazingly warm coat!,5,As you know Levi’s jackets run a little small. The good thing is if you are fluffy like me this thing came in a 3XL. I thought to order a 2XL which is my usual size but it actually worked in my favor to go bigger.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Way too small,1,"Too short and way too small. I’m a fairly muscular guy but by no means massive. 6’0 240lbs. This XXXL was too tight! I can get it on and it looks right, until I try to move and it’s so restrictive. I typically wear a L or XL in shirts jackets. Why would a XXXL fit me like smeedium? Levi’s needs to make these larger or start making an XXXXL and XXXXXL 😂"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Classic style for those chilly climates,5,"Great denim trucker jacket with sherpa lining for those chilly San Francisco days and nights. You can't beat the price too, the same jacket in the Levi's store was going for $128. Super comfortable materials and fits as expected. Roomy enough that you could add an additional layer like a thinner sweater, sweatshirt, or button up shirt. Available in various denim colors as well. Just note the sherpa lining does not extend into the arm sleeves, it's padded with another material and the button closures are snaps and not eye hole types like the original vintage designs. Classic design that will never go out of style, I hope to own for many years to come."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,I absolutely could not afford a new coat...,5,"Since I could not afford a new coat, and yet needed one for winter, before it gets cold enough for my CAT Jacket, I used all the money I had, and bought the Levi Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket. I could not be more happy. It fits perfect, as well as fitting as I would have expected it to. I wear a large, I bought a large, it fits perfectly. Looks stunning with the consistent Levi quality I expected. IMO, you cannot find a better winter jacket than this, at this price, that isn't going to fall apart with heavy work. I got the Duvall (Waterless) color, and it is the most perfect black I've seen in a coat, just a stunning Jacket. I'm getting my Son one for Christmas, he's going to love it. Buy this jacket, in your normal size, and you will not be disappointed, as we are in many purchases these days."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Levi's Men's Type III Sherpa Jacket Size XL Color Hail Storm,5,"I purchased the XL Size jacket and it fits very well though it's not as roomy or as thick as a Classic Levi's jacket, it does fit very well around the torso and the length is at around my hips, I am just under 6' feet and weigh about 180 lbs. and I'm still considered Slim fit, the arms are a little narrower than a Classic Levi's jacket. My jacket color is Hail Storm and it's not the ideal color I would have liked but it was the only one available in XL, this Jacket came with 5 pockets, 2 snap buttons on the upper front, 2 open pockets on the lower side above the waist and 1 inside pocket on the left. All the buttons are snap buttons including the adjustment tabs at the hips. I am overall happy with my purchase because it's still a good style jacket that I'm familiar with and all I have to do is throw it in the washing machine and dryer to clean my jacket and then sent it to the dry cleaners every 6 to 8 months to help keep the jacket keep its form by getting it professionally done every now and then."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Almost bought S, glad I chose M",5,"Tomboy here... 5'10, 150 lb, relatively flat chested, and the Medium is the right size. I usually wear a small in men's clothing, just sits on my frame the right way, but sometimes I choose a medium so that it will fit the way I need it to. This jacket looks like how my small items fit me, but feels like how my medium items fit me. I can wear a hoodie or layer AND button this coat up and it fits well, plenty of room to do that. Or I can just wear a t-shirt underneath and it still fits right, not wide chested or broad shouldered. This is just the craftwork of Levis, can't beat it, and that inner pocket is probably my favorite thing about this jacket."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,He likes It!,5,"Got this for my man for Christmas I measured his chest and everything before doing any purchases, but it fit correctly I gave it to him a little early. He’s very pleased with itHe is 5’7” 170 lbs and a chest width of 39 at the widest part of the chest it fits perfectly with not much room for him to get bigger but he likes it that way"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,sizing is ridiculous.,1,"I have one of these from the 70's, that I inherited from my uncle. It's a medium, and other than being a bit too short (right above the belt) it fits well in the shoulders, chest and arms.I wanted to get a new one, because the old one is 40 years old. I read that they ran small, and so I got an XL. That was too small, so I returned it and got an XXL. Even at that size, the shoulders were so tight I couldn't move my arms, and the waist WAS STILL ABOVE THE BELT! Why would they make a jacket so ill-proportioned, especially at an XXL? Don't buy this jacket if you are over 5'9"" and 150#."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Runs very small, good quality material",3,"Runs very small. Boyfriend is a 2XL, it’s pretty short but that wouldn’t have been as big of a deal if it fit his shoulders properly. Levi runs small to begin with. Jacket was good quality material."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"A little small, A lotta smell",3,"I'd write a serious review but... I just can't get passed this stench. The jacket has a really strong chemical odor. And not just sniffing up close. I left it in my closet with the door open and left my room only to return to the entire room smelling very strongly of whatever it's been sprayed with. I also have reason to believe its a China version which I don't believe is fake but is certainly of less quality. I'm having trouble returning a different order entirely, otherwise I'd seek support with this pungent purchase. I guess I'll have to take it to the cleaners or something. Woof! I hope it isn't harmful to the skin. Whatever it's been soaked in."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Great quality, SUPER cute!",5,"IN LOVE with this jacket!! Many reviews- even from women- said it ran small, I however think the sz.S is quite roomy! (5’1 125lbs) Was worried the small would be too fitted but it’s perfect! Lots of room to move around and layer under! Love that the Sherpa lining isn’t a bright white, a nice natural wool color. My new favorite jacket for fall!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Not bad but bad smell sulfur/matchstick/warehouse lol.,2,"New jacket on the left old but new jacket on the right never worn that was dry clean now sitting in a trash bag with baking soda.Great jacket, I own two different colors already the only issue I have with this jacket after receiving it, it smells like it was stored in a old warehouse/sulfur so now to the cleaners it goes but looks good fits perfect. 9.28.20 update after cleaners the sulfur smell is not that bad but i requested a replacement and just got it the newb jacket the sulfur smell on the new jacket is worse 😆 so I am going to hold on to the first purchase since I have already got the smell down. I will bag it with some baking soda and dryer sheet to see if it pulls out the rest of the smell return the new jacket. I will air out the new one to see if that makes any difference in smell. I purchase my other two from Macy's for 98$ next time I will just purchase it at Macy's I am not doing this again 😆.10.9.20 After couple of weeks with the baking soda and dryer sheet in the garbage bag the smell is 90% gone."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Classic Style, Form Fitting Jean Jacket",5,"Comfortable, stylish and well made Levi's sherpa jean jacket.  These jackets are made to be form fitting.  There's enough room to move around but this jacket is an ""athletic"" or ""slim"" fit, running true to size but tighter or smaller than other jackets, due to the style/type of jacket that it is.  If you want extra room for mobility or layers underneath the jacket (beyond a button-down or t-shirt), I would strongly recommend moving up 1+ size, from what you would normally wear in a jacket."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Beyond worth the money,4,"Love this jacket.  I am 5’ 9” and weigh about 180 average build.  I purchased the large and it fits perfect.The reason for 4 stars is because one of the snaps for the waistband adjustments fell off when i took it out of the package.  No time to return it and i most likely will never use the smaller setting anyways, but it does make me wonder how the other snaps will hold up.Other then that, the stitching is great and it fits exactly how i was hoping it would.  It hangs right to my waist. The sleeves hang correctly as well.  The lining is very nice.  Sherpa lining on the collar and body. The sleeves are a quilt lining.  Other then that snap falling off, i love this!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Pretty sweet jacket,5,"I'm 5'7” 160# with a fairly athletic / active body type and this fits me snuggly if I layer a hoodie or sweater under it but I happen to like that.It's still a good fit with just a shirt on under it.It has snaps, not buttons and the sleeves are lined with a slick nylon or polyester fabric , which prevents your layered shirt ect from rolling up inside and trapping you."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Big in the middle--sized down,4,"Coat is good but has two main flaws. First, the coat is designed with a very square shape and a large midsection. Don't expect a tapered silhouette / tailored look unless you size down. This was purchased for someone with very broad shoulders and an athletic build, so it was concerning to exchange for a size down (from XL to L) in order to eliminate the tented look in the midsection even though the shoulders and arms fit properly. However, the size down did still fit up top and reduced some of the bulk in the middle. The other small thing to note is that the vent / adjustable area on the wrist really let in the wind, so we add long gloves or will sew in a flap."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Quality Jacket that is (somewhat) worth the price,4,"I purchased the coffee cord version in a size large, and it fits me just about perfect other than the sleeves being *very slightly* too long, but this should be fixed after one wash cycle. I am 5'11 175 pounds, and this jacket hits me very slightly above the waistline, which is in my opinion, the way a jacket like this should fit. It's very close though, and some people may find this jacket to be slightly small depending on your frame. I have relatively broad shoulders, and this still fits me very well in size large. If you're looking for a tailored, slim-fit look that also retains the aesthetics of this classic style, you will be hard-pressed to find a better option. This jacket is definitely overpriced in terms of quality, but you will not find a better looking wool/cord/denim jacket that looks this great without spending $200-$400. The quality isn't bad either, I just don't think it's up to par with other products from levi's in terms of longevity. For some people this won't be an issue because the wear-and-tear and the fading of the material give character to a jacket like this. I'm only giving a 4 star rating due to the weird fit, which happens to fit me perfectly due to my short torso and long legs, but I can definitely see other people having major issues with the fitting if they have shorter legs and a long torso (if you're 5'11, 170ish pounds and buy a large, it might hit you 2-3 inches above your waistline.)Summary: The style of this jacket is beautiful and it looks identical to the picture, and the slim-fit is a a MAJOR plus. The main caveat is that for some people this jacket will be very difficult to find the right sizing for; if you have Prime this won't be an issue, just perhaps order your normal size, then order a size UP, and send back whichever one doesn't fit the way as expected. This is my favorite jacket at the moment for any weather above 10-20 degrees fahrenheit, and I would definitely recommend it if you can manage to find it somewhere that isn't out of stock. The popularity for this jacket says all that needs to be said. Personally, this is a 5/5 product for me, but again, I'm only giving 4 stars due to the fact that the sizing will undoubtedly be a hassle for a lot of people depending on their build (even if their stats are the same as mine.)"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Fantastic warm jacket,5,"Would give this 6 stars out of 5 if possible or 11 out of 10. This jacket was so warm! My next younger bro and I are going to visit our youngest brother. I live in Houston, TX. We have 10 months of summer...and July and August! Needless to say, I don't have cold weather gear. Bought this on their ""try it"" plan and loved it as soon as I tried it on. We have 3 - 5 days of cold weather here, so it's not gonna get a lot of wear. Wanna get a non-insulated version for summer wear. Great style and the 3X actually went around my stomach. LOVE IT! Down below, ""Fit as expected"" should be ""Fit as hoped!"". It ain't light weight...didn't expect it to be."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,It's not their fault!,4,"I had a light blue Levi Sherpa that I wore almost daily during the winter for 10 years until I caught my reflection in a store window one day and saw how ratty it had become. I was a little older by then and thought I should start wearing more 'adult' clothing.Silly notion and I missed it so much I looked it up on Amazon because for awhile I had a tough time finding one that wasn't the dark denim blue, even here in San Francisco.. Well, I ended up ordering one through Amazon and it's wasn't the dark dark blue, its more the color of a well worn pair of 501's, almost acid washed. So, its hung in my closet for a year while I contemplate ordering the right, the  light light blue color I want.Point is, don't be hasty when ordering, like this guy. And Levi's, don't stop making these."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Odd fit with the short length, but otherwise as expected",5,"The length of the jacket is a bit on the short side, with the jacket waist sitting at or above your belt line.  If you're wearing a longish shirt underneath it will definitely hang down way below the jacket bottom, unless you tuck it into your pants.Aside from that, it's as expected.  Very padded and warm on blustery San Francisco August days.  It's perfect for walking around in, but a little bit too much for anything that might work up a sweat, like cycling.I'm 5'10"" with a pretty narrow frame, and I fit into a size medium."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Was a gift,5,"This was a birthday gift for my dad to replace an old one and it's perfect, i got it while it was on sale and i had credit to apply so I got it really affordable considering the brand. This jacket is one of those things where you are technically paying more due to the brand but they last SO long, i think this is maybe the third jacket (second from the this particular brand) that he's owned in about 22 years. They hold up amazingly, can basically get put through hell and back, keeps you very warm even in really cold weather, has a decent amount of pockets even one in the jacket and easy to clean."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Good jacket!!,5,"We have looked and looked for this jacket in stores for my husband to try on and make sure it fits. He is very picky about fit. But we never found the jacket. This jacket is The One. But. Buy a size bigger than what your man normally wears. My hub is 6'1"" 195# and lean. He wears a large tee and his jeans are 36x34 but I bought the extra large. It fits perfectly across his chest and the arm length.It's more lightweight than what his last trucker jacket but that's fine. That's what Carhartts are for."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Not sure who this is supposed to fit,3,"Great jacket -- the inner and outer materials. But, most likely, it will not fit you. At 5'9"", 145 lbs., I am a slim male. But I don't like any binding in the shoulders, especially while driving. Thus I bought an XL, as I usually do in jackets and shirts. Not only was this jacket too tight in the shoulders, but very full in the chest and abdomen. It seems like the model they fitted it on had narrow shoulders and a barrel chest. A chimpanzee is my guess."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Love it,5,"I bought this exact jacket 40 years ago and still have it. I loved the way it fit when I got it and wore it all the time but but I wore it when I was building my house about 10 years later and pretty much made it unusable for anything but work related activities. It took a beating and held up better than any jacket I ever bought. I'd always wished I had taken better care of it so when I saw that they were making them again and that they are back in style I ordered it immediately. I thought I'd need a larger size since some of what used to be chest is now stomach but the large still fit perfectly. I guess that old saying about what goes around comes around is true and eventually old becomes new again. Great jacket, very durable."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,If you wear XL in their shirts size down,5,"I ordered this jacket in XL because I read it runs large. I have a bunch of XL Levi's flannels that almost fit but are just a bit too small, so I thought the XL in the coat would fit perfect...it was way too big. I exchanged it for a large, and the large fits perfect. Putting this coat on is like wrapping yourself in a cocoon. It is so soft and snug; I even used it as a blanket one night. The look is cool, simple, classic. I replaced my older lined and unlined Levi's jackets with this. Can't wait for it to cool off so I can start wearing it again."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,WOW nice coat,5,"I've looked before for this coat several places but none offered the black Sherpa lining. It fits great and is warm. I would recommend checking your sleeve length & the jacket sleeve length measurements. My son is tall & slim and the sleeves don't make it to the end of his wrist ONLY WHEN he crosses his arms over his chest. You would never notice this during regular everyday wear. He and I both agreed this would not have stopped us from buying this coat because how many times would you cross your arms over your chest (unless you wearing it in your coffin I guess). Again, during normal wear the sleeves are fine but you may have long arms so I would check before buying to save time.  We ordered a medium - he is 6' foot and 154lbs."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Went up 2 sizes and it's still tight. It ...,2,"Went up 2 sizes and it's still tight. It is a lot thinner and lighter than the one it replaced from the late 70's that finally wore out, I don't see this one lasting 40 years at all"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Little tight but cool coat.,5,The jacket is t b e real deal but the 3XL could be a tad looser around thwaist and mid section. I am 5'5 and about 280 lbs. Short and fat guy. But the coat is awesome regardless.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Arm length too short,4,"My husband is 6'2"", 200lbs. He has long arms. We have to purchase 2xl shirts (most of the time) to get the correct arm length for him. I originally bought the XLT based on other reviews thinking the sleeves would be long enough. They weren't. So I returned the jacket for the 2XLT, the arms are still too short but not extremely. He loves the jacket other than the arm length so he's keeping the jacket. The only reason for 4 stars is the sleeve length. Other than that, the jacket is beautiful and great quality. If you have extra long arms, the jacket sleeves will be too short."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Not a guy, but I bought a mens size because I enjoy the oversize look and feel.",5,"I love this jacket. I've had it for over a year, and it doesn't stain easily or really show much wear and tear. I've been to the mountains in 30 degree weather wearing this jacket, and its very warm. It is a staple to some of my outfits, because of how versatile and durable it is. I could probably fall asleep wearing this jacket, because it is that cozy. I am a 125 5'5 female, so this jacket is a little roomy on me(bought a mens size for this very reason). My husband also wears this jacket from time to time, since it fits him, and I find him stealing it more than I wear it.I have absolutely no complaints about this jacket, its a 10/10 from me. Its beyond worth the price in my opinion."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Excellent Quality and Service!,5,"Excellent quality as expected. Fit is great except for biceps. A wee bit tight there, but then again, my upper body is different than most. Still very comfortable. I’ll be able to work & play wearing it without issues.Snaps in front are very heavy duty however I was expecting buttons. No big deal, it’s still VERY nice.I was pleasantly surprised that there were no threads to trim. Every detail was perfect as if it were hand made. Again, super impressed with quality.Delivery was less than 24 hours!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,It's a Levi and you should be happy with your purchase.,5,"I bought the xl tall and I'm 6'1"", 185 lbs, 35 inch arms. Fits perfect and the material is decent and I think it'll last for years. Warm enough for winter weather in the 20's with layers. Without jacket alone good for 40- 50 F degrees or warmer is a suitable cold weather temp all season jacket. I do wish the arms were lined but I still like it very much. A- rating."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Wayyyyy cheaper here, same good quality Levi's jacket",4,"I bought this for my brother (he really wanted a Sherpa lined denim jacket) and the fit was just as expected. I was nervous the Medium would be too small for him but it fits just right. I mean he literally can't grow an inch or gain a pound because it's exactly right. The color is also as expected, perhaps a bit darker but still fine. The Sherpa lining is soft, there's no chemical smell like I read in a few reviews.DEFINITELY a good choice having bought it here on Amazon for $50 less than at JCP at least."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Just keep swimming...just keep swimming (XL, XXL)",3,"Mustard Blue with cream Sherpa LiningDespite the reviews I’ve read on Amazon and videos I’ve watched on YouTube, this jacket does NOT run small for sizes Large and above. I wear an XL in regular truckers, and made the mistake of sizing up to an XXL.....it was a picnic blanket. Then I tried the XL, and it still was like a bath robe, where I had generous amount of room and could easily fold over each side....even with a hoodie on. It wasn’t until I was able to track down and try on a Large in-store, that the Large is actually the best fit....just right in the shoulders and enough room for a hoodie; no Michelin Man effect. Size down if you’re typically an XL or above."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Good go-to jacket for the colder months.,5,"Good Jacket for Fall/Winter. I would say this is an essential piece for any wardrobe. Not too heavy, not too light. Good for everyday use especially in the colder months. You can easily put this jacket on over a hoodie, no worries and it still won’t add too much weight like some jackets. The only thing is that it restricts your movement around the arms a little bit but I understand it has to be worn in so it will fit much looser. Overall a solid piece. Can’t go wrong with Levi’s."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,WAY TO SMALL!!,1,"tried this jacket on in the store, the size was a 2xl and it was just a bit too small, so i figured a 3xl would be perfect.  when it arrived i tried it on and it was WAY TO SMALL, no way it was a 3xl as the tag stated, it was a xl at best!  so be weary on buying this jacket, i don't know if it's a knock off or what, but definitely NOT what you expect it to be."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Listen to reviews, arms sized 2 sizes smaller than jacket",4,"Great jacket, except the fit. I listened to other reviews and got an XXL even though I normally wear a L.  Chest fits well but I had to stretch out arms in order to bend my arms at all while waist is easily 10 inches too big.  EDIT: For those asking. I measured jacket. At chest XXL is 46 inches (inside circumference), waist is 58 inches and at bicep it is 18 inches."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Favorite Jacket! - (Size Comparison),5,"Compared to clothes I get, this Levi Sherpa jacket fits exactly as expected. I would even say that the mid section and bicep circumference is even slightly large, when compared to sizing from J Crew and Express. (The sleeves and chest fit the same as from those stores.)I was very happy that I could buckle the two clasps at the bottom at hip/waist to tighten by 2 inches total to have slightly more fitted look.If I ever want to wear layers I can easily undo the side hip buttons to have plenty of room."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Stinks!,2,"I give the black version of the jacket 4-5 stars. I normally wear an XL but an XXL worked better in this jacket (and being Levi’s, you know it will shrink a bit over time).My issue is the stink! At first I thought it was me, then I suspected my washer/dryer, but neither I nor my other clothes smell. I washed it a couple more times and it still smells. Now I just use it for yard work. Sad, because I really liked it. Anyway, if yours smells, it’s not your imagination."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Love the Jacket,5,"I'd been wanting a jean jacket after seeing a few people in passing wear one that I really liked. Just appreciated the style so I decided to grab a Sherpa version for the cold season. Ordered mine and it fits perfectly. Levi is a solid brand and it's built to last. I do have some concern that some of the sherpa fabric might deteriorate over the years, but for the time being it is perfect. Be sure to get one size up from whatever shirt size you wear. I wear a Large in pretty much every brand of shirt, so I got an XL of this jacket and it's perfect. I've rated a few products on here before and I don't throw around 5 stars often at all. But this is definitely a 5 star product. I've received compliments on this jacket literally every single day I've worn it from both men and women. If you're thinking about getting it, get this jacket."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,The sleeves will squeeze,4,"Fit just at the waist, cowboy style but the arms were just barely acceptable. Speaking of the arms, they were so tight that I couldn't fit a long sleeve t shirt underneath it. I could barely reach up to adjust the collar. I'm 6' 1"" 225 btw. I'm not super muscular or anything, these sleeves are just crazy tight. I usually wear large and went a size up as other reviewers suggested and it was still not enough. I'd recommend trying a 2X if you're anywhere close to my body type. Excellent jacket otherwise."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Must Have!,5,I’m a woman and this jacket fits me perfectly. I got it for a good price too considering how expensive Levi’s can be. I was kind of iffy about buying a size medium because my chest is large and was concerned about whether or not it would button up. Fortunately it does but I still get the occasional undoing if I’m wearing something heavy under (if that makes sense). Highly recommend as this keeps me warm and looks very stylish.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Strong odor,1,"As other reviews for this particular color have mentioned, this jacket has a very strong chemical smell. I bought this jacket months ago and the smell has still not gone away completely. I've washed it multiple times as well, which is not something that should have to be done since that could wear out the fabric and cause the color to fade.It's very unfortunate since jackets that you can buy in-store would never smell like this. It is quite nice and even fits me well despite some reviews stating that they're too tight, but all the same the odor is inexcusable."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,I Love This Jacket!,5,"I live in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California, where it is very cold in the winter. I wanted a warm jacket with a stylish ""Western"" look that I could wear anytime—his jacket fits the bill exactly. I was a little worried whether the jacket would fit or not, but when it arrived and I put it on, it fit perfectly. I wear it when I go into town, and have received compliments about it. I should also mention that I think the price for this was very reasonable. I would certainly recommend it."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"I'm 6'3"", 190-200 lbs, and the XXL fit perfect.",5,"I usually have trouble buying things like this because my arms are 29-30"" long but torso is average for height & weight.  I have to thank all the other reviews for their input because that helped me pick the right size (one size up from what I normally wear) and the sleeves hit where they should and the rest of the fit is really perfect.  Excellent looking, looks to be made very rugged, and it's definitely warm by itself but not overly hot.  Definitely recommend!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Way Too Small,1,"I was bamboozeled - this jacket fits way too small and took about a month or so to be delivered. I’m 6’2 and 200 lbs and this fit like I was a fat guy in a little coat. I didn’t want to deal with the return hassle so I opted to just gift it to someone’s spawn. I like the Wrangler brand, I’m hoping this may have been a fluke."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,My son loves it!,5,"I got this for my son. He had purchased a cheap knockoff at a large retailer. The color bled, it started fraying, etc.I got him this one for Christmas.  He wears it all the time. We did Prime Wardrobe with a few sizes to check fit. He's 6'5"", and only 17, so wanted to make sure it would last a bit."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,I Love It😍,5,"The Jacket Fits Perfectly! I Ordered A XL And Still Have Room Which It's Button Up. It's Warm And Stylish And Looks Great With Almost Anything,I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED👍"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,EXCELLENT jacket,4,"I like this jacket a lot. Only issue is that the bottom half of jacket fits a bit loose and it's also shorter than expected. Im 5'10 and I bought an XL. It sits just above my belt. I would've liked it at or a little past my belt. Also, it feels snug when laying. I had a hoodie underneath and it felt a little tight around the chest/shoulders. Nonetheless, I still LOVE the jacket. SUPER warm and great quality."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Levi’s Never Disappoints,5,"I ordered this for my boyfriend. He is typically  a large or x-large depending on how the brand runs. He’s 5’10”, has broad shoulders and carries some extra weight in the abdomen. For reference from Gap he is always a large but Abercrombie & Fitch he wears both large and x-large.After reading through a lot of reviews I thought I should size up to an xxl with all the talk of how small it ran. I ended up choosing to order the x-large and it fits him wonderfully plus he has plenty of room for a thick sweater or sweatshirt. It hits below his belt when standing.Levi’s denim never disappoints, the quality is great. I like that as well as having the Sherpa lining on the bodice it has quilted lined arms. I feel like a lot of companies skimp on arm linings in jackets which doesn’t make sense. It snaps close and has an interior chest pocket.I love it so much that I told my boyfriend I’m going to have to order one since his is a little too oversized to borrow."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,It's the perfect replacement for a ragged predecessor!,5,"My husband has owned a blue jean jacket forever, more than 40 years.  He has worn it and loved it so much that the worn out and frayed collar had to be replaced and the cuffs frayed beyond repair.  Finding a replacement for the much loved jacket was not easy.  This one is even better than the original one, and has snap closures too - so much easier to manage than metal buttons and frayed buttonholes!  He is sooooo pleased with it."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,A Farmers POV,5,"I am 6’2 and between 200-185 now and I can say it’s a great fitting jacket. I ordered the XL blue denim and it’s been wonderful to me. I am a farmer in the Southern US and it is more than warm enough for our “winters” (30*F-75*F) the neck flap is wonderful for keeping wind off your face in a chilly morning and ALL the pockets are REAL.The only thing I wish was done better is the sleeves. The Sherpa is situated inside in a almost vest like pattern skipping the sleeves. There is a insulation material in the sleeves which I’ll bet makes the sleeves warmer but definitely not AS comfortable as a full Sherpa would be.Has stood up to a month of diesel wrenching, mud throwing, bitter cold mornings, and the worst welding sparks/hot metal can be thrown at it. It’s built well I definitely can’t complain. There’s a reason they’re called truckers jackets ya’ll. I wish I could tell ya’ll how hard it is to keep clothes anywhere near clean while farming but this jacket doesn’t get that same treatment. Whatever gets on it is another mark or stain that adds to the jackets. Hope it continues to preform well."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Best jacket purchase EVER (seriously!)!!,5,"I cannot say enough about this jacket. This thing is the bomb! Great for wearing with attire suitable for jean jackets, but with the 'sherpa' material, great for chilly weather where a bit more than a regular jean jacket is needed. And yes...this thing is warm. It also has a nice, soft lining in the arms (not the sherpa material). I purchased an XL, and I'm 6', 197lbs and it fits perfectly! Highly recommed purchasing!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Imitation,1,Although this version saves you a few dollars it's not a real Levi jacket in my eyes. The fur is different and the lining on the inside of the sleaves of the jackets has a different stitching pattern/ material/ color. Older versions of a Levis jacket has a blue lining inside the sleaves and newer versions have a golden/beige color lining. All Levi jackets come with A small red ticket on the outside with the brand's name 'Levi's' this jacket does come with a small red ticket but not with the brand's name instead it is just a white circle with a diagonal line through it.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,NOT LEVI,3,"This product is marketed as Levi, but it’s in fact an off brand called New Look Men.. with a Levi tag attached to it. Sadly, it’s the same price as an authentic Levi jean jacket from a department store. The jacket however is cool and comfy."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,It's an all sherpa shell,5,"I'd seen a different version in store,  but they didn't have my son's size.  I bought this excited for that jacket.  Boy,  was I surprised this was allll sherpa not just lined with it. We returned it for another.  The coat seemed very nice, so I'm not dinging the company because of my error. Just be aware that this is an all fuzzy black jacket."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,This thing got baggy,1,"I know there are folks who complained about the sizing, but there are other brands for that. This jacket used to be a uniquely snug fitting sherpa jacket - and it was hella stylish because of it. Levis bumped the dimensions to account for Americans expanding waistlines and now it fits like a sack. Sorry to say that they messed up a good thing."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"I love it, perfect for San Diego",5,It is heavy and that's what I like about it. It is very warm and cozy. If you button it up it's kinda poofy around the stomach unfortunately but acceptable.I also ordered the full sherpa one but had to return it because the sizing was completely different. Very awkward and uncomfortable.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Arms too narrow, but stylish and warm",4,"Before purchasing this I read from many other reviewers that the arms were too narrow. I didn't really expect this to be a problem as I'm pretty skinny overall 5'11, 165lb and got a large. But its true, the arms are very narrow. Its not a problem if I am wearing a tshirt under this jacket, but thats it, I cannot layer or wear anything other than a tshirt underneath.That said, the jacket is very warm and super stylish. I really like it and am happy with the purchase. But be warned of the arm size limitations and maybe go a size up."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Looks and fits fantastic. These jackets run the small side.,5,"Was surprised it had all snaps. I ordered a large on ebay used for 58.00. It had buttons? It had the Levi tag It was way small and I returned it. Glad now I got the real deal brand new from amazon for 49.00. I ordered the XXL and was a perfect fit. I am 5' 9 "" and 200 lbs. Measured before ordering. Really a wonderfull  jacket. Their chart is online."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,It saved my life this winter,5,"Our apartment is very cold in winter and we don't have a heater. This jacket totally saved my life this winter, as we pretty much were forced to stay in door because of the pandemic.At first, I doubted about whether I can wear it comfortably indoor. The great Levi's quality totally guaranteed its performance and cleared my doubts after I wore it for a few days. There is no weird smell, no stain transferred onto other clothes, and no wear and tear in the jacket after a few weeks.Overall, amazing quality at the affordable price!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Size,5,I ordered this jacket in a medium like I usually wear and it was to tight in the arms and chest. I returned it for a large. The large fits real well. The seller was very nice about the return and replacement. Very fast too. This is a fantastic jacket. I have been looking for one with snaps because the button holes on my old jacket wore out. I want to thank the seller for the time and trouble they took getting me my jacket. Very good price and a very good quality jacket. Thanks again. Will remember this seller.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great Jacket for the Price!!,5,"Howdy from the Oregon coast. Jacket arrived today, and other than the arms being a bit tight...it fits me. Won't be layering a hoodie underneath it, but it's well worth the price of $55.99 (after discounts). Bought my first Levi's Sherpa jacket way back in the 1980's, and I still wear it to this day...though it's been patched-up a few times over the years. - Bottom line: Levi's makes 'em tough an' they last. ~ Good luck!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Love this jacket!!,5,"I wear a medium in t-shirts, so I went with a regular fitted medium sized jacket. The fit is perfect! Arm length is exactly where it should be and the chest size is perfect. I can even wear a hoodie underneath the jacket with no problem.Very classically styled and rugged. I would definitely recommend this jacket!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Great product, but be careful of the size you choose.",5,"I have had this exact Jacket for over 40 years.  It was getting a little frazzled.  But the exact size as my previous one.  But as ALL the previous reviews have stated, you have to go a size larger.  I received mine, yep, too small.I was about to return it, my wife tried it on, it fit, didn't have to return it.Remember, ORDER NEXT SIZE UP!!!!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,The fitting chart is off.,4,"Liked the Jacket , reasonable quality, great price, ordered a 2xl probably should have a 3 xl but how to know without a lot of shipping time. Decided to keep the jacker as I am hoping to lose weight anyhow and then it should fit fine."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Faded a ton after first wash, smells like a factory, but is comfy",2,"My main issue with this jacket is that I followed the washing instructions to a T and the jacket still faded a ton after the first wash. Additionally, it came delivered with a very industrial-factory-dye like smell.After washing it 3 times, wearing it constantly, and owning it for about a month now, the smell is still very much there.I haven't had any other issues with my clothes so I know it's not the washing machine but when I washed it with other clothes the 3rd time, they all picked up the smell as well!I can't say at this price point I would recommend this jacket.It is nice and stylish but the amount it has faded in addition to the smell shows that it's not the best quality and that the only reason it's black is from all of the dye, that washed out immediately."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,I'm a woman and purchased this jacket for my self ...,5,"I'm a woman and purchased this jacket for my self. They make an identical version for women, but it's $40 more. For a  $40 difference, I think I can deal with my buttons being on the opposite side."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,LOVE,5,I am a female and bought this in a men’s size XL. It fits great. I like the men’s fit better because it’s a little longer than the women’s. I’m a 36DD- so the men’s XL fits perfect. Warm and not bulky. Stylish. Very satisfied with this purchase.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Decent warmth, but runs small & has weak snap buttons.",3,"This jacket is definitely small. Take that into consideration when ordering. I went 2 sizes up and was very nervous about that, but in the end, I’m glad I did. I consider it a pretty warm jacket, but it hasn’t gotten super cold here yet. The snap buttons aren’t as strong as I’d like, and the bottom always comes unsnapped when I sit or bend at the waist. Not sure if that’s a one off or if it’s a consistent issue. It seems hard to button then easily unbuttoned. Overall 3 stars for fit, quality and warmth."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Nice jacket but missing snap,4,Nice quality and my son loved it. However didn’t snap it closed for the first week he wore it. When he finally went to snap it shut the bottom snap was missing. Didn’t want to return it since it was worn a bit and I’ll probably have to pay a shop to replace the bottom snap. Really nice jacket and good fit but inspect it if you buy one before wearing.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Just Like Old Times!,5,"Great jacket.  I'm very happy with the fit, feel, look and quality.  I wear a medium and this medium fits comfortably.  I can fit a light sweater under it, but that's about it.  It's made in China and has to be dry cleaned, but it's comparable to Levi's that I've seen selling for quite a bit more.The price on Amazon was great and I would recommend this jacket."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,perfectly as described,5,"XXXL - I am 6'3 285, with a  52 chest, this jacket perfectly as described, and assuming the material holds up, i couldn't be more pleased! I got the juniper rinse, really like it, and may order it in the mustard too. (BECAUSE I'M WORTH IT GAWDDANG IT!!!)I wish they made this exact option with the  button closure vs the snaps, real sharp jacket all around"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Add two sizes,5,"I have a classic version of this jacket bought in the 1980s. It's a large. I purchased an XL and it's still smaller than the classic L. Feels tighter around the shoulders causing the sleeves to feel tighter/shorter. Fits perfect as long as I don't wear something heavy with long sleeves under it. The older classic large fit more like a coat, this newer XL fits more like a jacket. Not a deal breaker, I'm keeping it not exchanging. Been wearing it around and gotten use to the different fit. These things are just too darn cool. You'll love it once you're wearing it. Other differences from the classic: snaps instead of buttons and the lining of the sleeves is tan instead of black. This newer version has an inside pocket, probably designed for cell phone that the classic doesn't have.Still not as great as the old Lee Stormrider jacket. I've still got the one I bought in 1978 and always get asked about it whenever I wear it."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Not all Sherpa Lined Trucker jackets are made equally( insulation) as others...,4,"This is a very light weight ‘sherpa’ jacket if you choose the canvas(plum, tan). The white, black and camo have think Sherpa on the outside and a satin like lining, this is much warmer. I have one of each and the are entirely different from each other. It’s a very cold February in Maine and I’m wearing my fuzzy black Sherpa trucker jacket daily. My plum canvas just arrived and looks great but I’m saving it for warmer months ."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,What I've been looking for,5,"Many years ago I happened across this jacket.  For several years I wore it even on the coldest days.  Eventually I ""out grew"" it.  I looked and looked for a replacement.  I finally found the same jacket only with buttons rather than snaps.  When I ""out grew"" that one I found another - with buttons.  Now, after something like 30 years and having given away 3 ""out grown"" versions - all somewhat faded by much use, but otherwise in very good shape, I have found a replacement for the original - with snaps yet!  It is all the outer wear I need - even on the coldest Nebraska winter days."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Love the jacket,5,"I saw it and I couldn't resist, but it is a man's jacket, I am 5 foot 3, I ordered a large, if you are a woman buying this you can order small, I personally like it loose fitting, but the sleeves are too long, but I am going to keep it for ever. Very well made sherpa lined inside, but not the arm sleeves."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Actually Keeps You Warm,5,"Very strong exterior material and soft interior material. The faux fur does not cover the whole interior, which means no fur in the arms, but the arms are still warmed by the thick outer material and cushiony inside. This jacket keeps you warm and is very fashionable, unlike other jackets that look warm but are not. Not hard to match with dark or white clothes. I’m short and slim so I got a men’s extra small and it fits perfect."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Perfect if you’re skinny.,4,"This is a warm, and well made sturdy jacket but, as been said it does run narrow on the arms. I’m not a very buff dude 14inch biceps last I checked but they feel tight. Not comfortable for driving."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great Casual Jacket.,5,I was looking for a Jacket that i could wear when the weather is not warm for a sweatshirt and not cold enough for a big heavy winter jacket and this one is just right.Lining is nice & soft and comfortable.The jacket itself is Nice looking very casual.Fits perfect.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,DONT BUY IF UNSURE OF SIZE,1,"DONT BUY IF UNSURE OF SIZE! Great product, horrible return options. I bought this jacket as a gift and used a coupon but the jacket was too big. I wanted to exchange the jacket but I was told I had to return the item and then rebuy the item for full price meaning they would not honor the price I bought the item for. Absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. I contacted customer service and they said there is nothing they could do. A jacket I bought for 60 I not have to return and buy for 80 plus tax."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Black one has strong chemical smell,2,"I've had this jacket for some time, and it has finally come to the time that I can use it around the house, and it smells so strong to a dye chem? so I washed it and the color faded and the smell persists.I have tried talking to amazon regarding this issue as the return window expired, unsuccessfully. there is no way to contact the seller. so I would def not recommend, at least in this color."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Broken and smelly,2,"The jacket looks awesome and fits absolutely perfectly. However, it's not worth the substantial price. The jacket arrived with a broken snap at the very bottom of the jacket. This wasn't a big deal since I don't use that one, and I decided to keep the jacket. However, even after several washes and airing out by a window, the jacket still reeks of sulfur dye. It is a pungent chemical odor. I'm buying a Wrangler jacket next time I want a trucker jacket. They're cheaper and don't arrive broken and smelly."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Please read.,5,"This jacket fits perfectly. I read a lot of reviews prior to purchasing it and everyone said to order a size up than your usual size so I did and it’s perfect. I wear larges in shirts so I always get XLs in coats and jackets so I can wear a sweater or flannel beneath it and with this one I order a XXL as suggested and it fits as I would if it were a XL which to me is comfortable. If any of you men have that itchy question in body size, I actually have a little bit of a belly and with going up one size than your usual size I was able to snap the buttons and it not feel tight. I’m very happy with this purchase."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,A size should fit as advertised regardless of a sellers posted disclaimer.,2,"Having read the sellers recommendation for this jacket, I ordered it a size larger than I usually purchase (I'm a large, so I ordered an XL). I should have to compensate for each individual clothing manufacturer. A large should be a large, a medium should be a medium. If I reach for something, the sleeves end up getting pulled way back, and I look like chris farley from 'Tommy Boy' (except for I have a size 32 waist)."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Strange fitting,4,Arms are too big for us slender folk. They have a button but no additional holes to tighten the sleeve which is very disappointing. Medium is also very tight and im pretty skinny at 5’11 160 lbs. Its a great jacket but a very strange fit and im not sure if a tailor could fix that.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Took me back 40+ years.  Nice Jacket,5,"Nice jacket. I'm 5'10"" and 155lb. I ordered a medium. It fits pretty much like it's supposed to. As long as I don't put my arms straight out the sleeves fit. But if I reach out they could be shorter than I like.  I don't normally layer my shirts so the chest is ok but if you were to want to wear a hoodie or something like that I would Recommend 1 size up.  Yes I would buy again and I do recommend this jacket."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Love this jacket!,5,"Feels a bit tight in the upper back. When I extend both arms forward, it binds in my  front armpit. But not enough to keep me from wearing this great jacket. I've wanted this jacket for years....  Found it on Amazon, had it in my shopping cart for months, and when it dropped from $79.99 to $43.33, I jumped on it."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Good for ladies too,5,"I have been looking for a good Levi jacket. The ladies seemed too crop top like,  so I found the mens. I usually wear a small in men's but read reviews on sizing,  I ordered medium in mens and fits great. I can wear a light sweater underneath."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,BEST GIFT EVER,5,"My hubby is very hard to buy for. He has longer arms but thin waste. So we guessed a large and it is PERFECT!!! He LOVES his jacket. He has always wanted one like this for years (since his first jean jacket with fleece when he was 8 years old). He wears it all the time. Best thing is, it came Christmas Eve.  We were expecting it in January."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Good looking jacket, excellent fit, but has strong formaldehyde odor",3,"The good:excellent stylewarm liningperfect fitThe bad:strong stench of formaldehydeThe outcome:I'm keeping the jacket, but clothing manufacturers should consider not using formaldehyde. The odor can be removed but it should not be shipped with this stench."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Warm Stylish Jacket for Cold winter A+,4,this Jacket is really good and warm i would choose size small for chest size 40 even that the chart say M for chest size 40 .. size ( M ) is good specially if you are going to wear sweater under it so you can add more layer under it. if you plan to wear it on top of light shirt of short sleeve T shirt Polo T shirt .. i would recommend you to choose size small because is going to be too baggy and loose ..
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,I like the jacket but it's not made to size,3,"I'm usually an L or XL in men's outerwear.  Got this in XL and it's snug.  Went to Macy's to try on their selection from the line.  Turns out all are cut small (which is the bad news).  The good news is I like the looks and feel of this one more than any of the items in the line they had a Macys (though they didn't have the denim).  #2 was the black jacket with ""shearling"" lining."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Light blue looks darker,4,"I gave this to my pops. We got that one color that’s like a Jean color but a bit lighter? I thought it was going to be too light but I had read some reviews and they said that the lighter color was a bit too dark to be the light color (if that makes sense). Well I risked it and went for it and yup, that’s the perfect blue I was going for.When my dad wore it, it looked just a bit too tight on him but it still looks good."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,He loves it,5,"I bought this jacket for my fiancé and he loves it! He’s 6’2 280 pounds and very broad shoulders.  The 3xl is the size I picked and it fits him great, it’s baggy but not overly baggy. Large enough to wear over a sweat shirt if needed. Super warm!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,nice coat --- Oddly fitted to the shoulders,2,"This would be a great coat if it was not fitted so oddly in the shoulders.  I'm typically a medium to an occasionally large.  Here the large fits really well except when I have it on it feels like my shoulders are pinned back.  A lot of other reviews suggest this issue, I should have listened.  If your very ""slight"" of build"" this might work nicely for you."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Stunning to look at, warm, and perfect fit!",5,"This might be one of the best Levis sherpa trucker jackets I've ever owned - and I own 4. It fits perfect. The color is dark brown and gorgeous. I took it to Zurich last week, which was completely snowed in, and wore it with 2 base layers - and it was VERY warm. In short, this jacket is absolutely perfect. FYI: I'm 5' 5"", weigh 147 lbs (64 kgs?), wear size 31 pants at the waist, and ordered a Small. Again: perfect fit!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"5’7, skinny, and it’s a bit big for me.",4,"As a fairly skinny person, not anorexic, a small size feels too big for me. The sleeves and chest/body have a bit of room in them when I put them on. I guess I have a short body?I should put on muscles to compensate for the room. But yea, it’s a bit spacious for a skinny person for a small size"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great! ...but a lil tight 4 bigger men,5,"It's a great jacket! A little tight around the upper arms, but still a solidly built denim jacket that is warm and looks great. I'm 6'2"" and weigh 240 lbs and the 2XL fit great around the chest and waist but was a lil small around the arms. I normally wear a 2XL in jackets & sweaters."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great gift for an up and coming rockstar!,5,My husband says that this was his favorite Christmas present ever.  He is a chesty guy with long arms and this jacket fits him just right.  Based on his measurements I got him a 2X.  Now he can be warm and fashionable at gigs.  This jacket is a classic.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,They run very small!,2,"I firstly want to say that Levi's is one of the best clothing company's out there in my mind, and as soon as I am refunded I will be buying another jacket (the next size up). That being said, I ordered a XXL, as I am 6'6, 230lbs and I figured that the double X would fit just fine. Sadly I was mistaken, as the jacket is too tight and the arms are way to short. I'm returning the jacket and am going to try a XXXL and will report back on its fit, but if you are my size, don't waste your time and just get the XXXL! This is going to be my first time getting a triple-X clothing article so I am a bit surprised as well, but hopefully this will help some larger guys save some time!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Old school Levi’s quality with excellent fit,5,Really like this jacket. Impressed with the quality of materials and construction. It’s very warm too and I wasn’t expecting that. Looks great. Fit is excellent. Big enough to wear a sweatshirt under it but not too big to wear on it’s own. Caught this at a great price too. My new go to favorite jacket.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Nice jacket,5,Normally wear a 5x but only a 6 x is available. The jacket fits but the cuffs need to be folded over. Doesn’t come with extra snaps and good luck finding after market snaps that fit the size. They are smaller than normal( not 5/8) .
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Not as warm as the one it replaces (many years old),3,"The lining is made from recycled plastic bottles, which is good, however: it is a slightly yellowish white.  The old one is a slightly grayish white.  The lining is not as plush, and does not appear to be as warm.There is a nice inside pocket that is perfect for my phoneIt was made in Bangladesh, and the old one was made in the USA."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Very nice jacket to fall or winter.,4,Very nice garment. Fits just as expected. Very soft Sherpa and stylish. My kind of drip. Also there is an inside pocket on one side of the jacket. There is a zipper to zip up the jacket if you want and a second layer for buttons that snapped over them.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,it's a great jacket,5,"it's exactly what I was looking for and it's as good as what I expected  it's a nice warm jacket I live in Colorado so I need and warm jacket this one fills the bill I would recommend it, it's warm and comfortable at the same time,worth the price I paid for it"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Sizing seems way off.,3,"Smart looking jacket, but I swear is 2-3 sizes smaller than expected. I'm a big guy, wearing 5X. My shirts are 5x, my hoodies are 5x, pants that are measured in Xs are 5x. All fit fine if a bit loose. This jacket feels like a 2-3X and make me feel like almost like the kid in a Christmas Story with the jacket being almost too tight."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Mutha Trucker,5,"I had one of these babies when I was a kid and I worked the hell out of it. 40 years later and I'm working the hell out of a new one! Runs a bit snug, I ordered large instead of my usual medium and am happy I did."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Sherpa Trucker Jacket6,4,"I've wanted a sherpa Levi's jacket forever. Finally a tall size was in stock, I'm 6'7"". I would say it runs on the small size. I usually wear a XLT. I ordered XXLT so I could fit a sweatshirt underneath. A XXLT fits if not a tad smug. My suggestion is to order a size larger."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great coat but sizes are small,4,"I wear a 40L jacket, 34 waist, 15.5 x 34/35 shirt: “M” by the “size chart”.  I usually buy a “L” shirt, so I figured an “XL” would be ok fo a coat... was too small: tight shoulders and chest, too-short sleeves.  I ordered an “XXL” and it is nearly right on the body (just a bit tight on shoulders, bit loose at waist) but the sleeves are still slightly short (probably same length but more on arm because of shoulder seam position)."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great but stinks,2,"I ordered a black one! Love this jacket on my husband, he mentioned there being a strong unpleasant odor to it. I think maybe it’s just the dye of the jean because even after 2 washes it stinks. Total bummer since it’s not necessarily a cheap item and we washed it so obviously won’t be attempting to return."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,So Good I got another,5,"I got the small and it fits just like I expected. It’s warm and comfy, I can also fit any of my hoodie beneath it. It had the sulfur smell that came with so I washed it, aired it out and added cologne to it to reduce the smell, so far the smell slowly diminished. And I love the jacket. I bought another one"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Perfect fit,5,Fits as expendedI gifted this to my boyfriend and he LOVED itVery flattering on everyone
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Better Quality Control Needed.,2,Purchased 2 of these jackets in different styles. I had no problem with the other one but this jacket I noticed had a weird nasty stain on it. I thought it was rust from the buttons but its not. I think this jacket was once used and resold because I also found a little rock in one of the pockets of the jacket. Also the other jacket I purchased was made in Bangladesh and this one in China maybe quality control is different idk just an observation.  The jacket is great and fit my husband very nice but I'm disappointed I received it all stained and gross.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,This jean jacket/coat is great. I absolutely love it.,5,"It's a little too loose for my liking but that was my own fault. I like my shirts, and certain jackets or hoodies slightly tight around the waist and chest. I got a Medium because I thought a small would be too small. However I love the jacket regardless. I will be wearing it a lot during cold seasons trust me. Over all its a 5 out 5 for me despite it being a little too loose. (Again that was my fault not Amazon's or who ever was selling it.)"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Pretty good,4,"I got the XS as I'm pretty small and it fits much better than the S. Very warm and comfy. Only downsides are the pockets aren't lined, and there's no button or clasp to keep the neck standing up, but even so it's pretty warm even with the neck down. Overall I really like it"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Jacket fit is smaller than expected,5,"I'm 5'9"" 200 lbs, and I commonly were an XL in jackets and sweatshirts.  Fortunately I have tried on these jackets in the store in the past so I know they run small for the size.  I bought and XXL and it fits perfectly.  Jacket looks good and feels good."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Awesome warm jacket!,5,The quality can’t beat Levi’s denim the Sherpa is only in the chest portion though which was a let down but doesn’t take away anything for me. Still a very warm jacket nonetheless and you can layer stuff underneath.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,I love this jacket!!,5,"I'm an ""All Things Levi's"" type of guy. Bought this on a whim, and just love it! For someone in the 5'10""  170lb range, the Large size is a perfect fit. No regrets on this purchase at all."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,I Love This Jacket,5,"It fits great, and is warm, but not TOO warm (it's always tough finding a jacket for the California climate). I also love the vintage look, and the fact that it's slightly adjustable at the waist. Totally worth the money."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Love my jacket,5,This is the jacket I been looking for a while. Bought my first one it a big box store. Been looking everywhere. I think of this as more of a coat. It is very warm even on the coldest day. It does have some weight too it. It's very comfortable and looks great. Well worth the money.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Good fit,5,"I do not like the fit of the women's version of this jacket so I (5'2"", 125lb) bought a men's small. It's exactly what I like. It is a little baggy and has plenty of room. I could have gotten a small if I wanted it to be more fitted but I prefer the loose fit. Love it!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Best gift ever for my husband,5,This jacket is amazing.  Gift for my husband.  He loves it.  A perfect fit.  Arm length chest and waist are so much better than expected.  I would recommend this purchase.  Well worth it
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Size up 2-3 sizes!,3,"I bought this jacket 2 sizes too large and it is still too small! The jacket also smells intensely of what I am assuming is the dye used to make it black/acid washed style. It's a shame, I really love the style but the smell and poor fit really bring this down.I still gave 3 stars because the jacket is very warm and I do love the way it looks. All in all I wish I had returned it."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great jacket. Very warm.,5,Good quality jacket as expected from Levi's. Sherpa lining and jean quality are night and day better than the slightly cheaper retail price of the same style jacket I got from Urban outfitters.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Nice Jacket with ultra slim contour,4,"Very well made jacket. I usually wear a medium shirt so I ordered a medium jacket. It was very tight. I then returned it and ordered a large and it was a great fit. If you want to wear a lot of extra clothes underneath, I would order two sizes bigger. Overall the jacket was a 10 out of a 10 for both construction and design. I'll be ordering this jacket again for a gift this Christmas."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Perfect 👌,5,"Got this as a birthday gift for my hubby! The jacket is exactly as described & pictured - seems to be excellent quality. It's very heavy/thick and warm. Came with the Levi's logo in all of the right places, as well as the tag. He can't wait to start wearing it!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,My husband's favorite jacket,5,"He's 5'8"" and weighs 135 lbs.  This jacket is so great, he wears it all the time -- never wears any other jacket in winter.  I bought it for him for Christmas, now I will get the unlined one for Father's Day ~ what a hit!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Get two sizes to compare,4,"I'm a xl in trucker jackets, but this one fit me ok at size L and too big at xl, get two sizes to compare"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,BEST JACKET EVER,5,My husband loves his jacket. He use to wear one back in the eighties and now he will have one again. I already had several people ask where did we get it from. I directed them torn you guys.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Over seas clothing never fits right,1,"When I ordered this who knew we would have a pandemic!, by the time I got it we were knee deep in all this, problem, now what?, all I ever get from all there phone numbers is a recording. Of the one thing I learned is to not order clothing from anyone overseas, go to the store where you can try them on first."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Materials smell horrible and don’t wash out,2,"The jacket seems to be relatively well made but it smells obnoxious, which we assume is from the manufacturing / dying / fire retardant or shipping process.  We have washed it 3 times now with pre and post wash/rinse (2hrs in the machine each time)  and with oder eliminating beads and still can’t get the horrible smell out of the jacket.  Very disappointed in Levi and whomever manufactures these for them."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Awesome all season jacket,5,I love this thing. Wear it with a T-shirt for warmer weather or throw it over a sweatshirt for the cold. I’m 5’7 and on the smaller side and a Small fits perfect even with a sweatshirt under it. The only thing is that it’s on the stiffer side but that’s what you should expect from a denim jacket. Half the fun is breaking it in!
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Grrrrreat,5,"Fits well, fairly warm (good for 12C/50F), looks great (""Duvall waterless"" = black and made of recycled bottles). Good pockets all around. I got a $20 discount on a Prime Day deal, but honestly it's worth the full price.."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,GREAT JACKET FITS TRUE TO SIZE!,5,"Better than expected quality, reminds me of old Levis jackets I used to have in the 80s/90s. Don’t believe people who recommend getting one size bigger. They seem to be in denial about their real measurements. I’m typical medium (5’9’’, chest 39 in) and Medium fits as custom made."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Comfy, warm, & looks cool",5,This jacket fits well and looks great. It’s comfy and warm.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Most excellent,5,My dad used to have one of these jackets when he was younger and he lost it few years back during a move. Got it for his birthday and he absolutely loved it definitely a good buy.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Sleeves is too tight!  chest is tight!,1,"Hey did you do it for skinny s hipsters,sleeves like for 12 years old boy's on xl size... wtf? So disappointed....."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Order a size larger,4,"I love this jacket I just wish I had ordered a size bigger. It fits well if I'm wearing something underneath unless it's a thicker shirt like a hoodie or sweatshirt.Still one of my favorite jackets, just too small."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Best give my husband loved this year,5,Got for my husband and it’s his absolute favorite jacket now. Worth every penny. I hope to find similar ones in different colors or corduroy colors. A great buy.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,sharp look,5,"as expected, the jacket is excellent quality, i ordered a size larger and the fit is just so slightly big, but not bad, i would rather have the jacket fit a bit large than fit a bit small."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,I love it,5,It exceeded all my expectations in terms of warmth and comfort. It actually was heavier than I thought.  It is styled like a Jean jacket but wears like a winter coat. It’s quite toasty.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Order size up.,3,"Seems like they used regular sizing but then added the fleece.... not allowing for the added bulk.Returning.  Def order a size up , esp if worn overa heavy shirt."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,I got an XXL,5,Got the Jacket love the look but the Arms was just way to long .. I had to get it fitted to my likeness and adjust the arms but other then that 5 stars nice and warm.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Awesome!,5,"This is a great jacket, very warm and it looks great too. I would order one size up though it's a little snug but the length is right. I love it."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Really warm, good quality",5,"We had to try on a couple of sizes, but the XS did the trick. Recipient has a 29” waste"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Good quality, you won’t be disappointed.",5,Bought for my son as a Christmas gift. He loves it! Great product!
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Solid jean jacket!,5,"I'm 6'7 and ordered an XLT. I'm normally a large-tall for shirts and jackets but saw the reviews and decided to size up.  Fits very well! (Keep in mind these types of jackets are only supposed to go to waistline.) Still slightly fitted but also still enough room for layering. The quality seems on point for Levi's standards, and the denim feels durable. The sherpa is super comfortable, warm, and looks awesome. It doesn't continue through the sleeves, but there's at least still some insulation there so its a pretty warm jacket throughout. Overall stoked on it!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Exceeded my expectations,5,"This is my first jean jacket. I first bought a large, but it was just a bit snug. I was worried the XL was going to have too much room. It did not. It fits perfect. I'm 5'10"" 185lbs.I wore it over a l/s Henley in Boston for our engagement pictures, and it kept me much warmer than I thought it would. It was 30° out.On mild days, it's not too warm either.I love this jacket more than I thought I would."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Runs small.,3,Runs small.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Size up,5,I am a 6' 205 lb. muscular man and an XXL was the perfect fit for me. I bought an XL first and then exchanged it for the larger size. My advice with this jacket is buy the next size up from where you are normally at.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Levi’s Rules!,5,"Wow what a beautiful serpa jacket Definitely Levi.  5’8 165 M was a perfect fit w tee or long sleeve tee, anything more get a Lg. This jacket was made perfectly"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Well Received Christmas Present,5,"My son requested a jacket that would fit over a hoody, for the chilly not quite cold days. This jacket fit the requirements perfectly.  It looks good on"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,My husband loves it!,5,It was a Christmas gift replacement. I got him one for Xmas 2X he didn't like the fit. He loves this one....
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,It’s pretty good deal,4,"It’s not a bad jacket. It fits and all, I wish it was a tad longer. I’m 6’ and It sits just about my belt line. And the sleeves come down a few inches past my wrist. I also with it were actual buttons that held it together, not snaps"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Very good looking jacket,5,"Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend in the xl size. He is 6ft and 220lbs, fit him well and it compliments the upper biult."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,The sizing is smaller than expected,3,I ordered an XL which is what the sizing chart had said and what I usually wear but it is a bit tight.I wanted to exchange it but there was not an XXL available.  A few days later the XXL was available so I ordered it and I will give the XL to charity.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Perfect fit and great color!,5,My husbands Christmas gift....he LOVES it!!! It is a little bulky which makes it hard to move freely but that was to be expected. Perfect fit and great color!
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Smells,4,"I first ordered a L for my husband who is 5'11"" & 190Ibs. It was too small in the arms. I ordered a XL and it fits great, seems durable, and looks good. Only problem? It smells like chemicals from a factory. It's been about 2 weeks or so and it hasn't fully gone away yet."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Go a size up !!!,5,I would suggest getting a large because I got a medium and it fit me good it looks good and feels good but when it came to moving It’s kinda uncomfortable since it’s tight around my back and the arm length it’s kind of short specially when I raise my hands the jacket always comes up all the way to my belly button I would suggest going a size up when buying these
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Use the sizing chart!!! It works for best fit!!!,5,"I ordered this for my husband. He is 6,1” and weighs 270. He has a long toro so I purchased the 2XLT and it fits perfect!! It is a little tight through the shoulders when he crosses him arms but other than that it’s perfect!! I based my sizing choices off of the sizing chart and it didn’t disappoint at all!!! Great quality product that washes easily and didn’t not shrink in the dryer!!!! Would recommend to anyone!!!!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Quality control issues,4,They seem to have quality control issues. Fits way tighter than the identical jacket my brother had in xxl.  Returned it and got a size up in the non Sherpa lines version.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Better than expected,5,"It has an inside pocket and the ""sherpa"" plaid lining is thru the sleeves also. That makes it much warmer over quilted sleeves if you are wearing a T-SHIRT. Just love it! The inside lining is not black, it is kind of multi colored plaid. Levi tag says MSRP is $98.00."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Favorite denim jacket,5,I had been searching for this. It was on sale. And it felt like a championship win. Love this. Fits great on women too!
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Medium fits fine for average guy,4,"I'm 5'9"", 175 lbs, athletic.  Medium fits almost perfectly.  If anything, sleeves could be 1"" shorter, but I'm not willing to size down to get there or take this to a tailor."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Back in the day jacket!!,5,This jacket is really nice. Very old schoolish. Unfortunately I ordered a extra large im a women and I was swimming in it. Will be returning for a large.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great Jacket,5,"Fits a little bigger but can layer this winter. Looks great, nice fit, well made. Price was awesome."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Manky jacket,5,Very warm jacket for the fall and winter. Perfect mix between western and modern jacket.  Fit is perfect like every other Levi's trucker jacket. The color is a bit different than the picture. Looks a bit grayish to go with the green.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Cozy,5,I purchade this for my husband.  He lives it. He has been able to wear it a couple of times.  But loves it perfect size.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,A big on the small side,4,I thought it would fit like a Lee jacket but it was tighter and the sleeves were shorter. I ended up sending it back.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Weird opened package.,1,"This is a classic as expected. Doorbell rang, the delivery truck still outside. I immediately went to door. Package was on my porch, opened. What happened with thus delivery?  It was raining/snowing. Weird delivery."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,No stretch but that’s good!,5,Classic thick Jean jacket I love it! I got it oversized because I love the way it looks. It’s great quality and I’m glad I purchased!
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Runs small,1,This is not an extra large even though it says it is. I order an extra large and I usually wear a large or extra large depending on the brand. My arms do not fit in this jacket. It would not fit anyone who goes to the gym. The shoulders are too small as well.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Jacket,4,N/A
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Excellent but made a bit small.,3,I normally wear a 3XL in a jacket. These run a size too small. I bought the same jacket as a “Big and Tall” size 4XL. Which fits fine. Just order at least 1 size bigger than you would normally. Otherwise it’s a Great Jacket!
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Amazing,5,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, I’m sure he’ll love it. The quality is really good and what I expected from Levi."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great price great quality,5,"I've been looking for a Levi's sherpa at a decent price for about 20 years. $100+ usd almost everywhere. This price in my opinion is a steal for the quality. Sherpa collar and inner, polyester fabric for the inner sleeve. I'm 5'11 210 - 215 and the jacket szXX large fits pretty good if you like room snug fit try a sz smaller."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Nice jacket worth buying,5,This is a warm jacket and i like the black lining. Fits well to size . I bought XL and it fits as an XL should.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great quality jacket,5,"This is an exceptional jacket. I was so pleased with it and so was my son! My son is 6'2"" and around 165 pounds. I ordered the size L when he usually wears a M. Since it's a jacket and he'll wear bulky shirts I chose L and am very happy i did!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Too small big guy,3,Does not fit as suggested on size chart. My husband wears a 2x in all his other jackets except this one.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,To tight,1,For a xxl and xxxl the jacket was to tight in the chest and shoulder area no room for movement within the jacket.  Very good quality but not a good fit for husky men.
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Check size before purchase,5,This is a great jacket unfortunately Levi’s has changed their sizes. I have always worn denim jackets.I purchased an xl Which I typically wear and was too small I purchased a 3x the jacket was too large and the sleeves only came down to my wrists had to return it. Check size before purchase
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Thinner denim but still very nice,5,This coat is good so far I have noticed Levis denim is thinner than what I remember I washed this new coat and it still looks great
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Sleeves are too short for jacket size,4,"I ordered this for my husband.  I ordered a larger size based on the reviews.  The larger size fits perfect; however, the sleeves run too short for the size of jacket.  Otherwise, it is a great jacket especially for the price."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,No me agrado,1,No se si las tallas están mal o están cambiando tanto la m es s y la L es m muy pequeñas en los brazos incomoda de lo demás más o menos

Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Overall a great jacket, although I would have liked it better without ""mustard"" wash.""",5,"The sleeve lenth was just right.. glad I ordered X Large,  instead of the usual, Large. This also gave him room for layers, but still fits well.  The color I ordered was mustard blue because it looked most like the smaller,  vintage one I was replacing for my husband. I wish that it didn't have that dingy, mustard wash, but it is closest to the original.  Overall,  it is 👍 . He loves it!"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,This is a classic style and fit.,5,"Fits perfect, just like my old one."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Good, overall fit except for the shoulders",3,"I have been surprised by Amazon Essentials' sizing of jackets I have tried recently. Never had I considered the brand before until I had the opportunity to try a few garments. When I saw this jacket become available, I was excited. I wanted a lightweight one that would look great and not be too hot to wear. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations.Before I go into the details, allow me to share the advantages and disadvantages of the material this jacket is made of: 100% Polyester.Polyester has many advantages and disadvantages, and it is most widely used for active wear.Polyester PROS- Does not shrink as much- Quick drying- Inexpensive- Flexible and strong (does not need ironing)- ComfortablePolyester CONS- Not as breathable as cotton- In general, when wet it could stick to your body (but not with this jacket)Jacket PROS- Inherent with Polyester, it feels great- Is slightly shiny (some may consider this a negative)- Slightly waterproof- Warm enough for cool weather (but too thin for extreme cold)- Good fit, except for the belly area where it tapers more widely open: this can accentuate a bigger belly and make you look fatter- Looks great with the right person and body typeJacket CONS- Definitely is not a bomber jacket. It draws INSPIRATION from one instead- Feels tight at the shoulder blades when crossing my arms- Belly area opens more widely in the open position, accentuating a bigger belly more and make you look fatter- With certain body types, it can make you look older than you areOverall, this jacket seems well made, has a decent fit (except for the shoulder blades area when crossing my arms), and can look great on the right type of person and body type. This jacket, however, is not for me."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Well made, very slick when zipped. Pair it with some slim chinos and a plimsoll.",5,"~165 lbs, 5’8”, a medium feels tailor-made. Lots of compliments!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Comfortable and Stylish,5,LOVE THIS JACKET!!! I bought it because I had an idea in my head and it definitely came through for me! I was really surprised at the quality....like OKAY Amazon!!
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,On the fence,4,"I'm 6 foot and weight 175 pounds and bought a Large. I like the material, the weight is perfect for spring/fall. It's a nice looking jacket at a good price.  Like so many clothes I buy on amazon, the fit is slightly off but everything else is on point so I don't know if i should return it or not.  It's a little tight in the chest. I lift weights and my chest has some bulk.  If I was trying this out in the store, I probably would put it aside and see if I could find something better.  I'd settle for it if i couldn't.  It really is a nice looking jacket and would probably fit most guys my size"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,This jacket is too noisy when I walk.,1,"The sleeves make a loud sound when they brush against my sides when I walk. It sounds really cheap. The sleeves seem fine when my arms are at my sides, but if lift my arms up to reach for something, the sleeves suddenly feel tight."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Won't be fighting any bears.  Little snug, but decent jacket for $14",3,"Ordered the XL.  I'm 5'8, 240lb.  It's a little snug around the waist and the bottom elastic isn't super stretchy.  The material doesn't stretch much at all.  For some reason, it's really tight around the biceps, especially when stretching your arms forward.  I do not have large biceps.  So, it won't pass the ""bear test"" (don't have quite enough mobility to fight a bear) so I'll be sending it back.Also, the blue is a lot darker than I expected.  Maybe not quite navy, but a lot darker than the bright blue pictured.  Which is fine, because it makes it a little more understated and I actually kind of like it.All that being said, for $14, it looks nice and it'll definitely keep the wind off your back in cool weather."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Nice to look at, hell to work in.",3,"Good for looks, and quick trips. Tends to bunch up around the shoulders, if you trying to work anywhere shoulder level, or above."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,AMAZING!!,5,Absolutely LOVED this bomber jacket!! I wore it for a photoshoot and got tons of compliments!!
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Nicer than I expected,5,"I had a certain expectation for an Amazon branded jacket, but was pleasantly surprised when this arrived.  It feels like it is made of nice quality materials for a wind breaker.  The only complaint I have is that the liner gets caught in the zipper pretty frequently, but it pulls out easily so not too much of an issue.  This might wear the material out in the future but for now, there are no issues.  I've enjoyed wearing this on spring days and look forward to wearing it on summer evenings."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,My Wife Likes It,5,"In an effort to dress like a mature man in his late 30s instead of wearing my clothes like I did a few decades ago (buying clothes that were two sizes too big), I picked up this light bomber jacket and it fits and looks great. (Why do they call it a ""bomber jacket""?) It fits as expected and my wife made the comment that she's gonna have to step her game up since I was so fashion forward. For context, I bought the Large for my 5'11"", 194 lbs body."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Really Nice Jacket,5,My husband really likes this jacket.  Fits well and seems well made.  He said it was just what he wanted.  The only thing he said that was slightly negative was that the zipper pull seemed a tad bit small for the jacket.  I personally didn't feel that way.  Looks fine to me.  I would definitely order it again if he needed another.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Just what I was looking for,4,"Right weight, right fit, right color.  Only slight problem with the zipper.  It was sticking quit a bit, i have rubbed some bar soap up and down it and works a little better but it should work much smoother."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Size/Quality,5,"Perfect. Just got it a minute ago, and it is just perfect fit. I felt right going a smaller size than the usual size, so highly recommend going a lower size if you want it to fit perfectly, I had ordered a xsmall which I usually go small. This is essentially perhaps the best and affordable bomber jacket you can get with the quality, oof, yeah, I can't wait to sport it."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Great buy..,5,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Good quality for price paid.,5,This item was very reasonable priced and fit as about expected. The arms were a little longer than expected though.

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Great Light-weight jacket,5,"The extra large fits me perfectly and I am 5'11"" 210 pounds. I bought this for $15.76 on Amazon. I don't know why it's $28+ now? If it was back to the original price, I would by a spare."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Basic for the win,5,"It's a basic amazon essentials jacket and it's cheap. Don't get your expectations up, you get what you pay for. I don't expect to wear this more than a couple times since I have other higher quality jackets, but this is good enough for going out or if you need something for a night where it's just a little chilly."

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Narrow shoulder width,3,The material is great but the shoulder width is quite narrow. Similar to a suit that doesnt fit. Not for guys who have broad shoulders like me especially if you lift.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,the coat has a zipper tab that gets in the way of zipping.,5,the coat fits great and i can tell you that they said the model 6-2 186 and the coat is a medium.  i am 6-2 195 and went with the large and the coat fits great. the arms and the length and with the zipper up fits just a very little snug. not baggy or really snug to the point cutting off your air. would i buy it again? without a doubt. nice coat.

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Nice,5,Great jacket
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,It makes you get girls.,5,Its good
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Solid Jacket,5,"I've been pretty impressed lately with Amazon Essentials clothing. Their stuff is really pretty good quality with good cuts and tailoring. This bomber jacket is really a pretty great bomber jacket. A lot of reviewers have been complaining this isn't much more than a wind breaker, but I feel like maybe they were expecting a parka? Fashion bomber jackets are typically not very thick, but they aren't meant to be and certainly not at this price. This bomber isn't a survive the winter stranded on a mountain kind of jacket, but it'll keep you warm just fine in the 50s, maybe even dipping into the high 40s if you have a long sleeve on underneath, but, again, the purpose of this jacket isn't to provide great warmth.The jacket quality is really great for the price. It looks more expensive than it is and feels very nice to the touch. It's comfortable to wear and soft on the inside and doesn't make you clammy like some poly bombers can. The cut is nice on this jacket too especially when zipped. I love how simple the jacket is. There are no frills and no logos, it's just a very classic looking jacket that will continue to look good for a long time. I've already gotten compliments on it. Good jacket, good fit, good price. Wont be going out of style any time soon."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Surprised,5,"I didn't expect an ""essentials"" product to be a quality product but it is.  I like the feel and the weight.  I live in Southern Arizona where some mornings are below 40 or way lower so sometimes it's ""parkas in the morning and shorts in the afternoon"". I have about 4 different morning jackets depending on the temp. This is so nice and light weight that it will keep me a little warm when I start the morning dog walk and will not roast me to death by the time the walk is over. I am seriously thinking of getting this in other colors.  Highly recommend."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Light Spring Jacket in a ""Bomber"" Style",4,"This men's lightweight bomber jack from Amazon Essentials is not really a bomber jacket in the classic sense of the word.  Most bomber jackets I've had over the years were made of leather.  This jacket is more like a windbreaker, being very light and designed is a faux ""bomber"" style.  It features two side pockets and one inside pocket.  The jacket is made in Viet Nam and is 100% polyester.Machine wash warm with like colors.  Non-chlorine bleach only when needed.  Tumble dry low, cool iron, do not dry clean.All in all, a nice spring jacket although I wouldn't call it a bomber jacket in any sense of the word.  Looks good but not for keeping warm.  Recommended."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Nice light jacket,4,"This is a nice lightweight jacket to wear in Spring with one major caveat--the front pockets aren't especially deep which limits their usefulness for holding anything more than a set of keys or some small change.  When standing I was easily able to fit a 20-ounce bottle of water in the pocket.  The problem is as soon as I sat down the bottle tumbled out of the pocket onto the floor.  The same happened when I put a handful of change in one of the front pockets--as soon as I sat down some of the coins fell out.In addition to the side pockets on either side of the jacket, there is also an inside pocket that is far more secure and is large enough to hold a good sized phone.This bomber jacket has a nice fit and is comfortable to wear.  I got caught in heavy rain and while this doesn't offer the kind of waterproofing you would find in a raincoat it did a more than adequate job of protecting me from the downburst.  It also dried fairly quickly after being hung over a chair.This is an attractive jacket and a good value as long as you don't mind the smallish front pockets that should not be trusted to hold anything important or valuable."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"A basic windbreaker, but . . . Is there such a thing as too basic?",3,"This jacket is little more than a windbreaker, so take that into account when judging its value.PRO It fit perfectly on 5'10.5"" 170 lb frame. It will serve ""light jacket"" purposes fine. It will fold into overhead luggage, also a plus.  You'll be seen as practical, or the opposite of a fashion plate.CON The design notion ""bomber jacket"" is purely aspirational.  You won't be mistaken for running through a pre-flight checklist on the way to piloting a B-25."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Good basic jacket; well made,4,"I would say this is a bit more than a ""windbreaker"", since it's fully lined... but yes, it's not a heavy warm jacket.It strikes me as being a bit more of a ""baseball jacket"" than a ""bomber jacket"", but whatever. It's got simple styling. It's not glossy, as it looks like it might be in the product photos (it looks like they did some unfortunate photoshopping there)... it's just a basic poly twill. Pocket lining and interior body/sleeve lining is also polyester, and that part is more slinky and smooth. Collar, cuffs, and bottom hem are elasticized rib knit. Inside breast pocket on the left side.It seems to be well made, e.g., there are no exposed seams on the inside.A good basic jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Extremely lightweight - basically a shell. Cuts the wind but that's about it.,4,"Very thin and lightweight. I call it ""I don't need a jacket but my GF yells - PUT ON A JACKET, IT'S COLD OUTSIDE - jacket."" It's basically a shell. It cuts the wind and keeps in some body heat, but if it's cold outside it won't do much.It looks great - like a coaches jacket - and is handy on a windy spring day. It's well made and fits true to size.  But seriously - I keep it on the back of a kitchen chair to grab when I'm told to wear a jacket but don't really need one."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Blue is more like navy,5,"I love the quality of the item. It fits well, though the sleeves are a bit longer than expected but I believe that is so you do not run out of sleeve when reaching. It is warm and comfortable so far, even able to wear it in warmer temperatures (75f-85f) with minimal sweat and discomfort. The only gripe i really have with it is not enough to impact it negatively, but they should update the picture, the jacket is a bit more navy than blue. It is right around the mid-level between medium blue and Navy. It looks lighter in the picture. All in all 5 of 5 and recommendable to others."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Very Warm; Does Run Small,3,"The jacket itself is has nice details and provides plenty of warmth, it is a true bomber made of heavier material than anticipated. Great for outdoor activities or yard work in very cold weather. Nice pocket size, inside pocket is perfect for keys and other small items. I would recommend sizing up one if you are in between sizes, want more freedom to move around or have wide shoulders as it’s a bit smaller than expected. Does not shrink in wash and dispels dirt pretty well."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Great, Light-weight Jacket",5,"Living in the midwest, we need all sorts of jackets or varying weight to get through the seasons. This jacket is great for early spring, when you need something to block the wind or the chill, but don't want or need a heavy jacket. It's a baseball-style jacket, in basic black (always a great, wardrobe staple). The fabric throughout is polyester, so it has good moisture-wicking properties, too. And, it washed and dries in the machine(s) perfectly. It has two side pockets, and even an inside breast pocket. Overall, it is very well made with even stitching and good hardware. We love it and highly recommend it."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Great Looking and Great Fitting Jacket,4,"I really like this jacket. The XL I ordered was as perfect a fit as I've ever had from an off-the-rack garment. It's just right for Spring – lightweight with good wind blockage, a synthetic material able to provide some protection in a light Spring rain, comfortable and a nice looking classic design with a very faint sheen to it that lifts a simple design above the ordinary. It's a casual garment but the clean, classic look along with that faint sheen –  at least in the case of the black one I ordered –  is a great combo with dressy jeans and a good shirt. Def a good choice."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Medium weight, looks good",5,"I wouldn’t necessarily call this lightweight—it is warm and substantial enough to wear when cold (but not freezing) with a couple layers underneath, so I would say it is medium-lightweight. Shoulders are top-stitched for structure and durability, and the garment is lined.The outer and inside left chest pockets are deep enough for a smartphone or wallet, though they’re not quite as big as some jackets, and the material has a slight sheen that makes it look nice enough to wear with business casual clothes and still look fine."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Comfortably warm,4,"This is a nice, lightweight jacket but it does run a little small through the shoulders.  I got my husband a large, which he usually wears, and it zipped up fine and looked nice, but he said it was a little tight in the shoulders and that an extra-large would have been perfect.  He does have fairly broad shoulders, so... anyway,  I  thought it looked nice on him and he said it was comfortable to wear and perfect for this time of year (spring)."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Cool but not very warm,5,"Very cool jacket, my son says he feels like Fonzie when he wears it. I asked him how he even knows who Fonzie is, and he said from when I showed him the Weezer video for ""Buddy Holly"" - Ha! Although it looks cool and is well made, I don't think it's very warm, and would probably be best as a light weight fall or spring jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Nice and Light,5,"This jacket is quite warm for how light it is.  It even repels water a little bit, which might explain its desirable warmth to mass ratio.  As you can see in Amazon's photo, it does not run very large, but is comfortable, nonetheless."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Light stylish,4,"100% Polyester shell and lining. Machine wash similar color s & tumble low. Rib collar, cuff and hem, Zipper closure, Two side body pocket and typical inside pocket. Light stylish jacket, wouldn't stand up to fill winter wear but it's a nice spring/fall type protection."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Lightweight Bomber Jacket,5,"Perfect lightweight jacket for almost any season. Has zipper up the front and side pockets. Design and fit is flawless, material is excellent. Great jacket to throw on over anything. Would look good with any bottom. Material feels durable and rugged for being on the thin side. Very comfortable. Five stars, highly recommended."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Old Dad says this is a nice, lightweight Spring coat that's cut a little big.",5,"He's had others that were a little small, but he says that this one is big enough for a heavier shirt underneath. You should know that he's highly selective about the fit of his clothes, so your mileage may vary. LOL Still, he really likes this coat and says it's very highly recommended."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Very nice looking Bomber-style jacket in a windbreaker,5,"This jacket looks good. It has the style of a bomber jacket, but since it's not the classic leather bomber, this one is practical on days when a leather jacket might be too much.  I like the looks of it and it makes a good windbreaker."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,this is basically a 'members only' style jacket,4,it's quite thin and has that slippery style of 'Members Only' brand from the 80s. There are no zippered pockets and there is an inside pocket also.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Gotta Love Dad Fashion,5,"Great retro bomber jacket. Comfortable and stylish- like, Dad stylish!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Cheap feel,2,"Cheap feeling jacket. Very thin, folds flat which is a plus but the fit was off. Tight and wide, I am 5'9 175 and a medium did not fit. Not even sure if a large would fit nicely."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Great under my bomber jacket,5,Very soft and light.  Great for layering under a bomber jacket to give just a little more warmth without a lot of bulk.  The sizing is right on.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Worth it.,4,"Really good light weight jacket. I'm only 5'-7"" yet 230lbs. Bought an XL and it's perfect."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Worth it,4,"Easy to wash, heavier than expected, fit as sized, and comfortable. Recommended"

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Good quality bomber jacket,, Good fit, Good Material. Good Value for Money.. and Good, quick Delivery time.. Very Satisfied with the whole deal.. Pity (they) sent me a Navy one instead of the Pale Blue one I ordered.. Still. . Very Satisfied with wrong coloured Jacket of Great Quality that will last a lifetime I'm sure. .. .Keith .."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"3XL-4XL size was actually 3XL when it arrived and fits fine for 3XL but would probably be too small if you are 4XL. I did get caught out when first ordering the XL-XXL size which was XL when it arrived and didn't fit, although returning it was easy and Amazon confirmed my refund the same day I posted it back."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"I like the fabric and the fit is perfect,I'm  5'10 and 42in chest and well made."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"This jacket is well made, fits well and excellent quality.  So cheap too.  Buy  it everyone you won't regret it."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Not a fan of this jacket. It looks cheap too. The main thing that I don't like is that the zip fastener is on the wrong side. I couldn't be bothered to return it but I haven't worn it once.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Great light weight jacket. Very stylish , I was asked several time where I got it and the price , everyone astounded at the price , like it so much I bought another in blue , purchase of the year for me .."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Mido 1.80 y peso 79kg con un cuerpo no fit con love handles y me quedo perfecta.En terminos de calidad no le pide nada a las bomber de este estilo de marca que te cuestan el doble. Es mas o menos delgada con una tela de calidad de tipo rompevientos pero un poco mas abrigador.La medida de estos gringos es... rara, el largo de las mangas (tengo brazos largos) es justo, ni queda muy largo ni quedan tiesas justas, esta super bien. Las mangas estan un poco mas anchas de lo que quisiera pero no se ve mal, simplemente no creas que va a ser algo de corte fit con el que presumas los gainz y tu fabuloso cuerpo en V, sin embargo no se ve nada mal, es un corte relajado sin ser feo.En la panza es un corte holgado, de manera que si estas como yo con tus love handles pues no vas a sentirte como tamal mal amarrado, lo bueno del corte en general es que como es un poco mas holgado puedes usar un sweater ligero extra debajo sin sentirte todo aplastado y si la usas sin ese sweater extra de todas maneras queda super comoda."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Husband was chuffed with this and material quality was excellent
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Nice light summer jacket. Fits well and great price.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Very lightweight jacket, ideal for a night out as the weather cools off in summer or on those days where its too warm for a thick coat but too cold for a t shirt!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Bought this jacket as part of an 80s fancy dress outfit, was really surprised at the quality and fit for such a reasonably priced jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Sleeves too short
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Jacket is good overall. Slight irritation with the zip being on the wrong side. Usually for mens clothing the zip handle should be on the left as you wear it. Sleeves are ever so slightly short as well.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"I like the fit, the price, and most importantly, the look.  It helps the fact that the price was cheap for the item purchased. Very happy with this."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Very nice
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Material light and comfy
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Jacket is just what I wanted and excellent value. One minor criticism is that there is no loop to hang the coat on a hook.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Good quality and a bargain
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Be careful when buying. I'm a large and this seemed to be an extra large. Way too big on me. And zip pull up is right handed.

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Great product
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Muchos detalles que señalar y compartir.La talla, pensé que me quedaría grande y no, quedó justo como imaginaba y demasiado cómoda. Compré talla grande, mido 1,76 y soy talla 32 de cintura.Leí en un comentario sobre que no es corte fit, eso es excelente, ya que si eres de cuerpo normal no ejercitado, la amarás.El material de final de manga y cuello es bastante cómodo, no es rasposo ni molesto. No tengo necesidad de quitar la etiqueta ya que no interfiere con las playeras o camisas al ponerla. El largo de las mangas es excelente, lo mismo con el largo a la cintura. El material del forro es excelente par evitar que se suban las mangas de playeras o suéteres al ponerse la chamarra.Espero que el color le dure bastante!También espero que saquen más en otros colores!!!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Buena chaqueta, suave al tacto y cómoda. Talla un poco grande para mi gusto, mido 1,80 y peso 85kg y de primeras pedí una tala L y la cambie por la talla M. La talla L me iba holgada y a mi me gusta un poco mas ceñida. Me la probé con un jersey fino y se puede llevar comodamente debajo.Chaqueta de entretiempo, no para temperaturas bajas. Ideal para llevar una noche de verano con una camisa fina o una camiseta debajo."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Pagato 12€, vestibilità ottima.Qualità dei materiali discreta, ma in virtù del prezzo pagato direi top.I colori sono leggermente più ""elettrici"" e la finitura del tessuto esterno è ""lucida"" quindi abbastanza particolare.Direi che rimane un prodotto interessante."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Il bomber è leggero per un periodo invernale non è adatto, più per la primavera.. veste molto largo e ho dovuto optare per una taglia M Dopo aver restituito la L anche se forse la S sarebbe più stata adatta, unico neo attira molto lo sporco ed i polsini si sono gia infeltriti.."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Me gusta mucho esta chaqueta, mido 1,84 y peso 80, pedi una L y me queda supergenial!! ha valido la pena comprarla, es ideal para primavera."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Estupenda chaqueta, el tejido es el brillante típico de las bomber, me está ligeramente grande pero si la vas a usar con algo más grueso que una camiseta el tamaño es el exacto. Abriga más bien poco (entretiempo) y es muy ligera."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Un po' titubande prima dell'acquisto, non avendo mai provato capi proprietari di Amazon, considerando il prezzo molto accessibile ho deciso di provare! E si è rivelata essere un'ottima scelta! Rifiniture ed estetica al pari di prodotti delle fasce di prezzo superiori, colori fantastici per chi li ama un po' forti e fuori dalle ""righe"""
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"neanche minimamente si avvicina a quello che vedete nelle foto, veste 2 taglie in più, la qualità e pessima, al produttore dovrebbe essere costata 2 euro, sembra di essere avvolti in pellicola!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Il prodotto, targato Amazon, è perfetto! Si usa sia in primavera che in autunno. Va bene per chi è taglia XXXL .Ha quell'effetto ottico luccicante. Possiedo anche la versione grigia. Tasca interna sicura.Consiglio l'acquisto."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Really happy with the fit and feel of this.  Cant beat it for the price.  I wish there were more colour options.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"This jacket is fantastic, the quality is excellent and it fits like a charm - just as expected by size. I’m 5’7”, 215lbs, about a 46 chest so with a bit of a gut, and a size L is perfect. I bet you could fit perfectly with a 44 chest too. Highly recommend!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,perfecta muy recomendable.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Me quedo bienMido 1.80Peso 85 kgEl color es muy bonitoLa cálida de esta producto es exelenteEstoy muy contento con la compra
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"La compré para regalar, en general quedamos conformes con la prenda, es de buena calidad al tacto, veremos si es duradera. Lo único que nos hubiera gustado es que fuese un poquito más larga. Mi hijo mide 1.83 Mts. y pesa 120 kg. por lo que pedí la talla XXL, y en realidad le quedó bien, sólo es esto, que sería perfecta un poquito más larga."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,LA USO COMO PRENDA DE ENTRE TIEMPO. ME ESTA UN PELO GRANDE
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"This bomber jacket is better quality than the ones you'd find at larger stores (H&M, Zara, Gap) and at a fraction of the cost. I've already received multiple compliments on it and have only worn it a handful of times. Really happy with this purchase!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Overall a very plain jacket. Fits a little shorter like a bomber jacket should. Everything on the zipper is black , if it was silver it would stand out way more, and be a way better jacket!!!Also lightweight , won't keep you warm , mainly for style. Bought size Large, 6'2 177lbs."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Talla perfecta, excelente regalo."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Niente di eccezionale come giubbino ma veste bene ed è abbastanza comodo. Unica pecca è la cerniera a sinistra invece che a destra.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Returned, but it’s not a bad jacket on a budget I would re order 100%, for price it’s awesome"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,Taglia giusta e qualità del prodotto molto interessante per il prezzo a cui viene venduto.
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,,0,"Für den Preis kann man nicht meckern! Habe es so nicht erwartet, bin überrascht!Werde ich behalten, ich finde es gut!"
EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,The Perfect Jacket,5,"I have bought two of these Jackets, this one, 'Desert Tan', and the 'Army Green'. Thinking about buying the 'Black' one? The colors are True! For me, these are the Perfect Jacket! Not to heavy, not a light Jacket. Warm for a 'chilly' day or night. The Fit is just what I was looking for. Not Tight, not Baggie. What I would describe as 'Snug'. I have 'Room to move'. They fit just fine with a single shirt/T-shirt/polo shirt/sweat shirt/sweater on, and I could wear a 'Hoodie' underneath if I wanted to, for those colder days/nights. I'm 5'10"", 205 Lbs, 42"" Chest, I bought size Large. Excellent wind breaker. The Style is 'Military', and I do get many compliments for these Jackets. The waste sits just below my belt line and the cuffs at my wrests. The two hand pockets are deep. I can get my hands in the pockets just past my wrests. All the other pockets, two chest and one inside, are functional. The Jacket Zipper is reversed, on the left, that makes no difference to me and I could care less. It works!!! The durability is Excellent and they are Well constructed. I'll put that to the test when I wear these camping/hiking up in the mountains, out in the desert and boondocks!!!! So far though, The Perfect Jacket!!! Note; I am NOT compensated in any way, shape or form for my review! I give a straight-up, honest review of the products that I buy!!! If it was junk, I'd say so!!!"
EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,Trash,1,Garbage. Zipper cheap and on wrong side for a man. Wore it on a motorcycle ride and I was freezing. Went directly in the trash
EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,100% worth the money; very well made!,5,"Bought this for a friend and he absolutely loves it. It is very high quality material and seems really well made. Fits just as expected and looks awesome! The inside of the torso portion is lined with really soft faux fur/plush material so I think it would be really good in cold weather but it hasn't been super cold here since I bought it. Only the torso being lined I believe would provide the warmth you need while not making you sweat in the underarms (which, as someone who overheats easily, is a problem I often run into with fully lined coats). Definitely recommend this! Money well spent :)"
EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,Looks good and keeps u warm,5,I was surprised that it fit me more loose then I expected so either I lost weight or it just fits well because I bought it in a size that barely fits me due to lack of bigger size option but I wanted it so bad that I got it anyway
EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,"Warm, classy looks good.",5,A size larger is fitted. You could still where a shirt underneath it but not a sweatshirt. The arms are on the fitted side but the actual body has a lot of room. Looks real nice. Zipper is nice. Already got one compliment. I like it. Thank you.
EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,Not a good fit.,2,"Just got it. Looks nice. 2xl is small in the arms and waist. 5'7"" and 275 needed at least a 3xl (not offered). Will be a hand me down to son. Will keep looking for better multi pocket field jacket."

EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,Winter jacket,5,"Very nice jacket, wasn't as thick as I anticipated for a winter jacket but it's nice, very warm wore it on a very windy day with no problem, strange the zipper pull is on the left for a mens jacket, but its worth the price"
EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,Not really worth it,1,I bought this jacket in the same size as the lighter weight jacket that fits perfectly and... this is too small in the shoulders and the waist. Pretty disappointed. Also got a different color than what I ordered.
EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,Great well made jacket and great price,5,"My son wearing large size, but I bought an extra large for his Christmas present, and he loves it.

EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,Nice coat order one size larger than usual.,3,Too small. I thought a 2X would be a good fit. The zipper is on the left side which is awkward.

Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,COUNTERFEIT JACKET SOLD!,1,"First, I'm writing this review almost 2 months late here due to having an extremely busy holiday season, so I haven't had the chance to bother filing a return when I immediately noticed the new jacket I purchased is not the same quality as my old official Columbia jacket I still own. But I'm so frustrated with this loss, that at least I can leave a review to let others know the downgrade of this jacket.**In the photo: Fake Jacket (Left Side) and Official Jacket (Right Side)I own the same Columbia Jacket bought 5 years ago and still have it, and it's amazing!  This new jacket I've received, the fleece material has a thin, see-through, cheap knock-off feel. The original has a heavier-denser fleece material. The main front logo on the new jacket is a tag stitched on the wearer's left side versus official embroidered logo on the wearers right side. The original side pocket zipper zips upwards to open. The new jacket side pocket zips downwards to open. The original has a bungee cord to tighten the bottom jacket's waist level, and this new one doesn't have any bungee cord (this could be a product change feature though)."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Not the quality I expected,3,"I ordered both a black and navy blue fleece. Received the items in a very prompt manner. I have been buying Columbia fleeces for the past 30 years and was replacing some I already had purchased directly from a Columbia store. The material in these current  fleeces I purchased  was not the usual plush Columbia fleece material I have purchased in the past. It was much thinner, slightly heavier than a flannel shirt. The colors were also not what I expected. The black was more of a dark grey and the navy blue more of a medium blue. I returned both. I still would recommend this  seller  because of their professionalism in handling my return.  I received my refund in a day , even before the return package had reached them. I was disappointed in the quality of the merchandise but I wouldn't  say the seller misled me with the description."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,"Warm, comfortable",5,"Nice warm jacket. I have an unlined canvas jacket that i needed a liner for during cold weather. I wanted it short enough so it doesn't hang below the jacket. This is perfect. I had a columbia bugaboo jacket years ago with an almost identical fleece zip out liner and i wore just the liner more than the jacket. Very nice, comfortable, quality as good at the one in my old jacket. I am 5'8"" weigh 150 lbs and the small is a good fit. I tried a medium first and it was a little large through the chest."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Nice jacket,5,"I ordered this jacket maybe a year ago and have since lost it.  It fit really well.  I'm tall(ish) so I worry about the length of arms and the waist being too high, but this had extra length in both those areas without being baggy. It was also super soft.  One downside is that the Columbia logo is a separate piece of fabric that's sewed on.  It's not something I would have really thought about until I read about someone having the preference for an embroidered logo (which I can understand).  Overall, I really liked it (and miss it) and would definitely recommend it."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,No embroidered logo!,3,Jacket fits nice and feels nice. I’m 5’9”/5’10” and 250 lbs. I got a size XL. Only complaint is I don’t think Columbia makes these styled fleeces with the embroidered logo anymore.  I made an exchange  and complaint about the sewn logo only to receive another one just like it. Even though the item description on Amazon says “embroidered logo”.  I went to the Columbia website and all over the internet to look for this style fleece with the embroidered logo but found nothing. Otherwise this fleece will do for now.
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Husband loves it,5,Bought this jacket for my husband and he LOVES it. He's from California so he's a bit of a baby in the cold weather where we live now and it even keeps him warm. Very impressed. Thinking of buying myself one so I don't steal his lol
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Handmade felt jacket would be warmer than this.,2,I bought this for my boyfriend as a replacement for a similar one in a different brand because anything I’ve ever purchased from Columbia has been great. This looks just like the photo and fits true to size but it would honestly be warmer to make a jacket out of felt from a craft store than this. I wore this in Florida on a “cool night” and my thin PJ pants were warmer than this. Very disappointing and now can’t return as we have already thrown the tags out. Would not recommend for warmth other than maybe being a bit cold in an office? If that...
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Not as pictured,2,I bought this to replace an older Columbia fleece cause I broke the drawstring at the bottom. The fleece is not as pictured in the listing. The Columbia logo is a patch not embroidered and the fleece material is thinner.
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Counterfeit Item,1,"100% counterfeit and most comments here say so. No idea why it’s even allowed to be sold on here. The logo isn’t embroidered, so it’s very easy to tell…. Gave it one star because it is totally fake.. but it’s warm, fits right, and will at least be good for my 2 week travel across the country. You should probably spend your money on real Columbia though"
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Colombia Fleece,2,"Overall, the fleece does the job. The ‘Colombia’ logo is not embroidered like described. It’s a stitched on patch. Color isn’t as black as I would have liked, probably more of a charcoal color. Fits ok. Keeping it just because of the prime deal I received on it."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Not actually black,4,"The jacket is a charcoal black I’m 5’5 155 I normally wear a s/m depending on the brand of clothing. I got the small, it’s fits in the waist but the sleeves are baggy, it’s big around the body. It also doesn’t keep you warm. Maybe it’s good for 50-60 degree weather.I was highly pissed that my package was delivered to the wrong house 2 doors down. That is why reading is fundamental people."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Ordered black but it was actualy dark gray..,4,"We have purchased a number of these fleece jackets over the years and are always impressed with the quality, fit, and price. Unfortunately, when I ordered this one, the color was not what I expected. I was under the impression I was getting a black fleece but in reality it was a dark gray. Had I ordered a gray jacket, I wouldn't have complaints. However, proceed with caution if what you're looking for is black."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,FAKE. Do. Not. Buy.,1,I ordered this fleece as it was the only available item to be delivered on time for the time frame I was working with.1) It was not delivered on time.2) the item description says Black. This item is most definitely not black. It is gray.3) This is not a Columbia fleece. It is a knock off. Whoever stitched the Columbia name on the left chest stitched it in the dark. Is is angled and looks like crap.It wasn’t delivered on time so I’m not even going to try it on. Can’t speak to the fit because I’m returning it.Save your time and money. Order elsewhere.
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Great Buy,5,"Bought this for my 15 year old son. He’s 5’11 and 144lbs so tall and thin. It’s a little big (the large was sold out) but it doesn’t look like it’s hanging off of him and he has room to wear a hoodie underneath if it’s really cold. He loves it and has wore it to school every day since it arrived. Washes well, too"
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,its more like dark slate grey which not quite jet,2,I am sorry but their black is not black: its more like dark slate grey which not quite jet. I had return two of them for this reason.The color should be naming should be done correctly.
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Very comfortable,5,Great fleece at a good price. Very comfortable. I’ve had this a couple months and I like it a lot.  It probably won’t last for many years. I can hear stitches give way when I put it on. For under 40 dollars you can’t go wrong. I wear it everyday at the office where it is cold and this is so soft and comfortable that I wear it more than any others I own
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Good jacket!,3,I bought this jacket in the past and was disappointed that now the logo is a patch. It had previously been embroidered. But it is a nice jacket for the price and washes well!
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Overall a fair price,4,"Its a little too large for a medium (hence 4*), but not excessively so. The fleece feels pretty good out of the packet; the long-term test will obviously be multiple wash cycles. Colour (Granite) was good."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,"Great jacket, but on the small side.",3,"I wear a XXL and had the same jacket for 8 years and loved it. Was time to replace my old one, but once received, the fit changed and a XXL is on the small side now. Jacket looks great, but XXL is more like a tight L."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Comfortable and fit nice.,2,This was a Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket.  It fit OK but we were very unhappy because it wasn't as pictured.  It was pictured a dark blue and a beautiful bright blue combo and it came as only dark blue.  My husband and I were very disappointed and will not order anything like this again.
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Loose fit and thin material in pocket. Nice Fleece though!,4,"The fleece feels incredibly soft and I would imagine it's warm, but the size medium was baggy on my 5'11"" 145lb self. It's unfortunate this listing doesn't have a small option. Also, the pockets are made of a much thinner material that doesn't feel as durable as I'd like."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Great looking fleece,4,"Great looking fleece that is lightweight but warm.  Sadly, the zipper pull broke within 2 weeks of receiving it so we fixed it with a paper clip."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Great jacket super soft and warm,5,This is very light and incredibly warm. I was really happy with this during my trip up north. Perfect for the 40 - 50 degree weather. Definitely recommend.
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Love the jacket,5,"I liked the blue jacket, that I received as a present. It is light, fluffy, fits well and it looks good. I bought a black one recently as consequence."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Fantastic!,5,"A great seller with a great product! The jacket came in a neatly package bag to not get lint on it, and the material is soft! There are pockets outside and inside, just and FYI, so super awesome. My little brother started wearing it as soon as he opened it and loves it!"
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Great Fit,5,Delivered on time and fit great. Very comfortable and not tight in the arms like a lot of these jackets that I've tried on at local srores.
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Comfortable and worth your money,5,"The product is amazing and so comfortable! I work night shift at a hospital, and it tends to get a bit nippy at work. This is perfect because it’s light and feels like a blanket. I’m 5’’6 and 160 lbs, and I got a medium. Although, I did accidentally dry it; It was a perfect size and perfect bagginess, but after I put it in the dryer it shrank similarly to the fit of a blazer. If this may be a dilemma for you I recommend going 1 size up!"
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Columbia fleece,5,We love Columbia products.  They always fit just right and keep us warm .  Highly recommended !

Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,GO WITH YOUR GUT!!,5,"Fits perfectly - I purchased a Medium. I’m 180 lbs, 6 feet tall, regular semi athletic build. I can wear it with a hoodie or flannel underneath and it looks great. It’s supposed to be a little snug.  I only read two or three reviews that told me to “go with my gut” and hundreds of other reviews that told me to size up to a large. I’m glad I didn’t listen to the masses on this one. I think the disagreement stems from 3 issues:- People aren’t sure how these are supposed to fit: the sleeves are supposed to come down to your wrists and the bottom should rest at the top of your waist at your belt line. It should feel snug some areas, or else it loses the edgy look.- I think there are lots of muscular guys with huge biceps buying mediums or smalls, OR very large men buying larges. If you have really big biceps, or are just a large person altogether, you may need to size up. If you fall with in typical sizes, go with your typical sizes.- Some might be 100% cotton and some have 2% Elasane (spandex); I think the 2% can make a huge difference in how it fits/stretches out. The one I bought was a “stretch” which means it had that 2%. Maybe they all have this? I’m not sure.In sum, if you over 6 feet tall and over 180lb, use the sizing chart and *maybe* size up. I’m very happy with mine. Can’t stop wearing it!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Best Review,5,"If you need to know your size, go to Levi's website and look up your measurements for jackets and it'll be fairly accurate. I'm about 5'10"" 185lbs~ and I went to their website, measured my chest (about 42-43"") and my waist (about 33"") and it said to get medium, so I bought a medium and the fit is nearly perfect. If you want a baggier jacket, I recommend going up a size from what it tells you, but if you're like me and want a slimmer fitting jacket, the measurements should be pretty accurate. If you do go with the slimmer fit and you want to wear a hoodie underneath the jacket, just know that it'll be pretty snug. But for wearing with just a normal shirt, it'll be great. Now onto the actual jacket. Everything is great about it except for two small things. 1. The sleeves are just a tad bit too long for me, but it's not bad. 2. There were some random wear marks in the jacket. Also, not a big deal. So far, I love it and I recommend it."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Size alert,1,"Very disappointed with the sizing on this jacket. I normally order a 2 extra large tall in jackets and shirts. This item did not have that size to select from but it did have a 3 xl so my thinking was that it would probably work.  It turned out to not even be close. The sleeves are too short and too small in diameter, the jacket is too short, the shoulders are too narrow and the jacket will not button. It's undersized in every aspect. I'm guessing that it probably would work well if a person wore a large/extra large but certainly not any larger than that. The tag in the jacket says 3 extra large, but it most assuredly is not."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,No Snake Arms Here,2,"I've been worn Levi's products, including the jackets in question, for about 55 years now. I'm pretty used to how their sizing runs. Until now, that is. I read some reviews before making this purchase, so I bought a size larger than I would have thought, an XXL. What I got was a jacket that barely fit anywhere, and the arms didn't fit except in length. I'm not a muscular guy, and I can just imagine the circus getting the jacket on if I was. Levi's has obviously decided that their future is with thin hipster's and not us plain old working folk. Okay, so be it."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"For the ladies, too!",4,"I bought a men's jacket so I'd be able to layer, and to have a longer cut. The ladies jackets seem to be cut really short and are very fitted. I'm 145lbs 5'7"" with wide hips and a small fits pretty well, considering it's a men's cut. It has the loose fit I was aiming for  but it is pretty tight in the hips. I usually wear a size 6 bottoms, and I can't button the bottom two buttons. I don't mind it though, because I don't plan to ever wear it buttoned up. I'm very narrow in the shoulders, so the breast of the jacket and the arm holes are a little large. Again, not bothered, because it will give me room to put a Hoodie under it in cooler weather. This is straight up classic denim, so there's no stretch, but it's also not too stiff. It's just right."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,The Classic Denim Jacket,5,"Fifty years ago, this was the classic denim jacket for guys...as it still is today.It is a light weight to wear in all seasons...over a tee shirt on a summer night, over a sweater on a winter afternoon.Many people want their denim jacket to fit like a snug, tight shirt.  I prefer a looser fit to wear over a thick sweater.  I am 5'10"", 180 pounds.  A medium would be tight and the cuffs would be above my wrists.  I got the large size, which fits loosely over a tee shirt and the sleeves cover my wrists.I like the loose/long fit so I wash the jacket in cold water and line dry.  If I wanted to shorten the sleeves, I'm guessing that a hot water wash and a hot dryer might take an inch off the sleeves.When your jacket is new you should wear it everyday until iteventually takes on the shape of your body. In a few months it will fit like a glove."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,If you have even a tiny bit of muscle consider ordering a size up,1,"Bought this jacket for my father who is a x-large in all shirts, jackets, and coats he has ever worn. However, this jacket was two small in the arms and thru the shoulders and chest. He is six foot two, and the jackets arms are long enough, and it fits him fine thru the abdomen but it is to tight in the biceps and the chest. I also ordered one for my brother who wear a medium and his fits perfectly. This jacket was on the deal of the day and is currently more than twice the price it was. Amazon refused to exchange this jacket for a bigger size. but is willing to refund the original price, but then I'll have to cough up the double the cash to get a jacket that might actually fit him. He has never ever wore and xx-large in anything. Could it be they labeled a large an x-large. We've been Amazon shoppers since Amazon started and have gotten a lot of good deals, but in the rare instance we have needed to exchange or return something we have had nothing but trouble."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Does not run true to u.s. sizes!,1,"This apparently runs in Bangladeshi sizes- this would be appropriate, because that's where it's made. Apparently, men in Bangladesh are quite a lot smaller then here in the united states. I ordered This in a 2xl size. The header shows it runs true to sizes- I found this wasn't so. As a 6 foot 230 pound person, I typically wear 2xl in most all clothing. This jacket came labeled a 2xl, however it was about 2 sizes too small. Making This literally a u.s. large? It seems like this jacket would fit a person about 5'7"" and a max of 180 pounds. I'll be ordering from another producer. Lee, or maybe wrangler? If ordering this item, I'd recommend ordering 2 sizes larger than you wear.... I actually attempted to put this on. My arms felt like stuffed sausages in the sleeves, and there's no way the jacket could be closed around my 38 inch waist."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Fit and quality.,5,"I was ver cautious base on reviews saying “too small, too big, not quality  Levi material”. However i really wanted a camouflage tucker jacket. I order my size, which is medium, I’m 5’6” 170 pounds and the jacket fit me perfect just like all my other Levi Tucker’s. I’m very happy with this purchase. When I’m dress to go out with it I’ll update post and show the fit.  By the way i did not receive no special discount or offers for my review. I just wanted to share this for all my Levi tucker jacket fans.  🙌🏿"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Now this is a “Boyfriend” Style Jacket,5,"I was looking for an oversized jacket to wear with certain outfits - this time to wear over a hockey jersey. Most “boyfriend” style clothes made for women aren’t really that oversized so I’ve given up and this was my first attempt at ordering a men’s jacket online and hoping it’d fit just right. Luckily it did! I’m 5’8, 150lbs and I purchased a medium. It had just the right amount of bagginess I wanted and it perfected the outfit I had envisioned. Very happy!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Great Quality, Sizing Different Than Yesteryear",5,"The quality of the jacket is incredible, but if you've become accustomed to the sizing of decades past, you need to order per the new recommendations.  Whereas I would have ordered an extra small ten years ago, I had to order a Medium in this fit, and it is still a bit snug.  I'm 5'-7"" with broad shoulders, curl 50's, and have a 33"" waist.  I mention the curling weights only to warn that if you have thicker arms, or curl more than 50's single-handed -- your arms will be hard pressed to fit in this jacket.  It's a modern, slim fit, and stretches slightly with wear, but it is also very unforgiving.  I ordered XS, and S, before finding that M fit properly though slightly snug."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,It’s WHITE !!!!,5,"After looking at this jacket for awhile online to add to my collection of Levi’s trucker jackets .. couldn’t  find any reviews on the “ steel hour “ color . Glad I got it now .. first off it’s bright white .. not off white or cream it’s white .. as I’m writing this review it just came to me you could tye dye this jacket .. but not what I’m doing but a thought never the less ... I bought it for spring to break down all the black I wear .. jeans , shirts and shoes . I have five Levi’s jackets . A few blue , black , grey . Love the white,  nice change .. will look good in black jeans and black shirt even grey or blue ... size is the same as all new Levi’s jackets they run very small .. I wear xl to xxl in shirts .. but all my Levi’s jackets are xxxl , then I shrink them with hot hot water in my kitchen sink ,I use a hot water kettle , water gets hotter , remember don’t stick your hands in sink , use tongs ,  let them soak till water gets cold then wring out and wash in washing machine on hot water setting then dry super hot , put on right out of Dyer fits like a glove .. this is how I got mine to fit nicely , this jacket will look good this spring .."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,should be listed as uniiiiisexxxxxx y'all,5,"I am 5'4"" about 135... I wear a size 6/medium in women's usually. I ordered a small mens in this jacket. It's a bit wider in the shoulders, which is to be expected since I have very narrow shoulders and most guys do not, but overall it's soooo cute, and comfortable to wear whatever I'm doing. Everyone compliments me on it, and asks where I bought it. I am a bartender, and the arms are loose and flexible enough that I can wear it at work when I'm cold, which can be am issue with some jackets. The denim part is not lined, but I've found it to be warm enough to not need a heavy coat so far, and I love it!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Just terrible. Wish I'd paid more attention to reviews.,1,"I'd read mixed reviews on this, but should have paid attention to those who said that the fit of this jacket is just bizarre. I ordered up a size as suggested, and the fit is just...weird. It was too tight in the shoulders, too tight in the chest, fine at the waist, yet too long in the arms. Not sure what kind of body this was made for, but it's gotta be an unusual one.I didn't bother reordering in a different size, because I just know that it won't work. It's just proportioned all wrong. I have two other Levi's jean jackets -- ""Vintage Fit"" and sherpa lined -- that fit me beautifully in Large. But this jacket, even in XL, is like it's made by a different company entirely. Or perhaps it was made for the Chinese market exclusively. It's not for normal-sized American men.And if that weren't enough of a deal-breaker, the back of the jacket has a HUGE and very ugly patch on it that says Levi's. It spreads across the entire back! I can't fathom who at Levi's thought anyone would want a gargantuan patch on the back like that. It's absolutely hideous, and even if the jacket fit, I would be returning it. I actually burst out laughing when I saw the patch. It's downright comical, and looks like something a 10-year-old would like.I really wish Levi's made a non-sherpa version of its Vintage Fit jacket, because I absolutely love that one. But this one right here is just awful in every respect."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Great jacket - poor sizing consistency,4,"Great jacket. But come on Levi’s, what is with the sizing consistency?For your consideration, please see my attached photos. On top is my Levi’s “Raw Denim” Trucker from 2017, with 3 years of daily wear and fades. Under it is my brand new Levi’s “Rigid Two” Trucker. Both are size Small. The new one is what I would consider a full size larger. Just size down, right? Nope, this is the smallest Levi’s makes.So, my advice to Levi’s: I know that it’s 2020, and us Americans are generally getting fatter every year, but believe it or not, some of us are not! Small sizes matter!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,These jackets are made and sized for the Asian market,3,"I've been wearing these jackets for 45 years, mostly Levis with a couple of Wrangler versions too. I currently have six in my closet.I'm a size XL.I checked the reviews which seemed to have a consensus that these run small, so I ordered a size XXL. What arrived was an XL (my size) - apparently they'd sold out of XXL.  I coudn't get my arms and shoulders in to the sleeves. I sent it back and re-ordered the XXXL which does fit me but is 2 sizes bigger than I normally wear.These jackets sold by Amazon are obviously not made for the US market. Mine was made in China according to the label.As a heads-up Levi's are curretly selling a Vintage Fit Trucker Jacket on their website. This Vintage Fit Trucker Jacket is built with more room in the shoulder and sleeves, and a boxy silhouette.. . ."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Extremely disappointed, not original trucker jacket.",1,"I ordered the levi's original trucker jacket in Color: Colusa/StretchI was very disappointed because this is not the original levi's trucker jacket.  It definitely has a new designed to it.  First off its not 100% cotton, instead they added a stretchy material so it could fit like skinny jeans.  Overall the body of the jacket fits just right.  But the arms are definitely too tight by 2 to 3 inches.  I definitely would not recommend this product.I have a original levi's trucker jacket from the late 90's and it fits just right and it's a large.  Because of other people's reviews I ordered a size up getting a extra large.  The extra large fits exactly like the large everywhere except the arms.  Again the arms are about 2 to 3 inches smaller than the original trucker jacket.  All I can think of for this continuing uncomfortable fad is that companies are trying to save money on material. Not cool.I just ordered another jacket that claims it's the original trucker jacket in light stone wash hopefully it will actually be their original since it claims it's the regular fit."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Great fit for women!,5,Great fit! It’s normally always hard for me to shop online due to me being female and having a different body type than men. I found this jacket fit perfect
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,XXL runs very small.,1,"Nicely made Levi jacket, just as you would expect. However the XXL was very undersized. Just for your reference, XL is usually just a bit too tight, and XXL fits just a bit loose, allowing me to wear a sweatshirt under my jacket. This XXL was easily 2 inches short of buttoning around my chest and my arms could not move forward because it was too tight across the back. It was marked XXL but sure seemed to fit like a small XL or a big L.  Very disappointing. Product was returned for a refund."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Man you Best Buy this jacket,5,"Absolutely love this jacket. It’s my second one. Good for mild days and on cold days, you can add a sweater. Sleeves roll up nice. Inside pockets are to die for, you can store so many sweet items in inside pockets. Man....this jacket sets the bar for light weight rugged jackets. I’m about 5’8 160 super average size dude and large fits perfect."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Stinks to HIGH heaven,1,"I am wholeheartedly PISSED. The jacket?  The jacket was exactly what I wanted.  Had several of these growing up, always LOVED them. This one was no different. This one was stretchy though, like it had been sewn with spandex - but no matter. The problem was -- THE SMELL!!!!  WTF!!!  I have since learned that products dyed black have a STRONG smell due to the chemicals they use.  So, I washed it, but I added all my other black laundry to make a full load. ALL items came out of the wash reeking of the chemicals! So I washed them again. And again. AND AGAIN!!.  Took the jacket and put it outside - FOR A MONTH!! No change. Meanwhile, the clothes I had added to the original wash went through many, many more washes. I used Oxyclean, vinegar, bleach, even used an ""at home"" dry cleaning method (Dryel)  . . . nothing took away that smell. I now am faced with the fact that not only will I have to throw away the jacket - I will have to throw away all the clothes that were washed with it."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Great Denim Jackets Which Seem to Custom Fit,5,"Jackets look like they were tailored to fit me, so I bought four in the black, dark blue, light blue, and charcoal.6'1"", 180 lbs, athletic, 33"" waist, 40"" chest, 16"" neck, 34""-35"" shirt sleeve. XL Jacket fits perfectly, with room for tee AND short sleeve shirt, or tee AND thinner long sleeve shirt. A lighter weight or medium weight hoodie and tee would probably work too! Very basic inside sewn pockets on both left and right are pretty deep, and really come in handy for wallets, phone and keys. But these inner pockets do not snap or zip, so beware when removing jacket or tossing it. Chest pockets do button, but not waist pockets. A tough and durable garment which should last a long time."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Fake cheap Chinese junk, different make, style, color, size and quality to that advertised",1,"The item I received was not Levi's but labeled (literally) ""No Logo. Made in China"". I ordered XS but received a S jacket and it was a completely differently color and still from the one ordered. It appears to be either a mistake or an out-and-out scam to send so cheap piece of junk from a market stall in a dodgy and dangerous part of town (or eBay!) instead of a quality branded Levi's jacket."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Long torso, fits just right.",5,"6'3 280lbs long torso, 3xl tall fits just slightly loose. I would prefer a trimmer buy opted to be safe and get 3xl instead of 2xl because I think denim jackets look better loose and layered.Hard to find good sizing with Levi's ive had a lot of hot and miss with their tall sizes, like their leather jacket at 3xl tall is insanely big on me.For reference I have a 42 waist and a 52 chest."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,I'm glad they were out of the XL and I had ...,5,"Ordered this in the Knoll shade as I wanted something different from the traditional blue denim jacket. I was going to order it in the XL as I normally wear a large, since the majority of reviewers said the jacket runs quite small. I'm glad they were out of the XL and I had to go with Large because it fits perfectly. In the arms, the body, the shoulders, everything. I can't speak for other reviewers, but I ordered the size I normally order in other jackets (Large), and it fits just as it should. Not sure why so many others are running small, but mine did not. I'm 6'3"" and 185 lbs, by the way."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Very cool classic jacket in a slim fit.,4,"This is a great basic light jacket in an interesting color (pomegranate).  The color is especially striking if you pair it with blacks & greys.  I've also worn it with blue jeans, but that ends up looking a little too ""Rebel Without a Cause"" for my taste.The fit is very trim, so if you'd like room to move or want to layer it over anything more than a thin sweater, size up.  I am 5'11, roughly 150 pounds, and bought a size small.  The shoulder seams line up with the points of my shoulders perfectly, and the bottom falls right above my hips.  The sleeves are just barely long enough, but ride up a bit while I'm driving (I roll them a bit up my forearm anyway).  I have a second jacket in this cut in a different color, and it is slightly smaller, so expect some variance jacket to jacket.The weight of this jacket is the same as a medium-to-heavyweight pair of jeans.  The jacket has no inner liner - just the denim outer shell.  It's suitable for a cool summer night or warmer spring/fall day.  It's lightweight enough to wear indoors in an air conditioned building."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,New favorite denim jacket!,5,"My new favorite jacket! I’ve always been a denim jacket guy, but this jacket is super comfortable and fits great. The material is nice because it’s a mix of cotton and other stretchy materials so it’s tough but conforms more to your body. Sometimes denim jackets can be really baggy on people but this one tapers in the material on the arms on the sides of your body. You can easily wear a hoodie or sweater under it without it feeling too tight. I got an XL since I normally wear a Large jacket I wanted a little more room for wearing heavier clothes under it. However it does fit true to size, so if you want to just wear a white T shirt under it stick to your normal jacket size. If you want a hoodie or something thicker I’d go a size up."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Great, but not without a little work.",4,"I'm a pretty skinny guy: 5'9"" 138 lbs. I was excited to see they offered an XS size because previous size smalls in Levis were just a little too big for me. I was even more excited to hear others say the arms were too slim, because that was my my issue with the other trucker jacket i have. The sleeves were too baggy on my old one.So I went with the XS small and it fit almost perfect. The sleeves are slimmer and the body fits great. However, the jacket was about an inch too short for my taste. I know trucker jackets are meant to be shorter than your average jacket, but still, this felt too short.I read that if you wet denim, you can stretch it out, so that's what I did. I dipped the jacket in a sink of warm water and clamped the top and bottom to a board for several hours to stretch it out. Now the jacket fits perfect! The pics I have are after I stretched it.Hope this helps!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Order size up, cut is slim",1,"My advice is that you order up one size from your last Levis denim jacket if you give this design a try. The fabric pattern runs slim. The individual who was to wear the new jacket has been wearing the same Levis style from this for more than 35 years. This person has replaced them a dozen or so times over the years for  rough at cuffs and elbows. This was the first time the garment fit was not as expected. The individual has remained consistently the same size and weight. Something has changed not only in the cut across back (not broad enough) , the angle at which the sleeves were inserted (too low as to restrict movement at shoulders and arms fromn the armpits), and the sleeves were too slim. Overall, there was less fabric in the garment for a size that has been true over more than 3 decades. The appearance of the jacket was as expected,  but the pattern cutting and assembly were not the standard of quality we have come to take for granted over the many years of dependability from Levis. Consequently,, the defective garment was returned. I add that we subsequently ordered 2 more of these same trucker jackets from a national department store, in the next size up. This resulted in 2 garments that were the same size as the previously owned item, however the same pattern cutting and assembly issues remained. The jackets also were returned. We have concluded that the brand is no longer producing the same quality, reliable goods, in the case of these particular items. We will seek alternative brands to replace the formerly adored Levis Trucker jacket. Greatly disappointed."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Not at all dark and muted like the picture,3,"The color I received was a much brighter and more saturated blue. Not at all dark and muted like the picture.Perhaps I received the wrong item, but I thought it was worth mentioning.Many people recommended buying one size up, which I did, but I think I’d have been better off buying my normal size (L). The sleeve length of the XL is perfect for me (6’4 lanky/athletic), but the length and width of the jacket don’t fit properly, making the jacket look decidedly baggy on people with more “fit” body types.Also, the chest pockets hit a bit too low on the chest.The materials are excellent, and the cut of the jacket itself is great. Just beware of the sizing (And potentially, the color)."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Great Jacket:  Careful in the Sizing Though,5,"I had to re-order two sizes larger (XXXL) after even one size larger than normal (XXL) was a smaller/tighter fit than I personally preferred.(I bought the Panther dark/faded black wash (black liquorice is another name for similar finish).  This larger preferred fit in my case was due to a few things:  1) I am an older guy, and not a fan at all of the fashion trend toward snugger, more 'fitted' looks, 2) that fitted 'look' is also sort of inappropriate for my age of fifty-seven, anyway, 3) I like to wear thicker shirts, sweatshirt, and hoodies under something like this - and the material is good but there is no lining - so in colder weather you would need to layer for suffucient warmth, and 4) I own an older 70507 Levis version of this same type of trucker jacket in blue denim that I love and fits perfectly for my taste.  Per the latter, that 'old' 70507 model Levis jacket is actually an XL, and it took an  XXXL of this newer jacket to achieve the same fit! (if anything, the newer model might be ever so slightly smaller).  I am 6'1"" and 225 with an athletic/moderately muscular build (need an athletic fit for suits when available).So, my experience/recommendation:1. Younger/trendier/fashionable fit or concerns - order UP one size2. Older/functional concerns - or planning to layer with sweatshirts or hoodies for colder temps - order UP two sizesThey really are cut snug with respect to more general or traditional fits for what an XL is, and that would prob hold true for S, M, L sizes too."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Perfect sizing perfect fit,5,Fit perfect usually I have to get a xxl to get arm & body length correct but body is huge due to some companies don’t offer tall sizes .  but getting the XLGTall in this jacket is perfect
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Awesome jacket! Buy a few to get the size right (you want it tighter!!),5,6’3 192lbs the Pillango color in MEDIUM was perfect for me with just a shirt underneath.You want these fitting tighter when you first get them because denim stretches a lot. These denim jackets (to me) look right when it’s a tailored fit and not lose or baggy. It’ll stretch out give it time!! So I would NOT size up.I’ve gotten a ton of compliments on this jacket so far and am very happy with it. Also the pillango color is wicked fashionable and looks great with my complexion (pale undertone but slightly tan with brown hair). Pair this with some dark pants and white T-shirt and it looks killer
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,The overall proportions of the jacket's cut are entirely out of whack,2,"***If you're wondering about the silly pose I'm doing in the photo I posted: that was as close as I could get my elbows together while wearing the jacket.***When I got to the part where I was supposed to rate the sizing of the jacket I was unsure of what exactly to put. That's because parts of the jacket are entirely too small while others are too large. The overall proportions of the jacket's cut are entirely out of whack. I'm 6ft 220lbs - I ordered an XL after referring to the sizing chart and measuring my neck and chest with an orbital tape. The shoulders and sleeves are way too narrow while the part that covers your trunk or torso is like ship's sail - it's massive. It's as if it were designed for someone with tiny arms, narrow shoulders, and a massive torso. Whether or not you lift weights chances are that if you're ordering an XL it's because you probably have a larger body than most people. Not just PARTS of your body are larger if you scale size upwards from someone of normal stature."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,How to PROPERLY FIT this jacket,5,"This jacket is real quality denim thick like you’d expect. I’m 5,9 and 180lb and got a medium. Torso length/width fits perfect, bottom of jacket should be roughly around the belt line. Although the arms run a little small in circumference, so if you buff built lol it’ll be best to size one up. And if you feel you’re comfortable without having to size up, remember genuine denim jackets are suppose to be worn and washed while in the shower a few times to get it to properly stretch and form to your specific shape.DO NOT PUT IN DRYER! LET IT AIR DRY OUTSIDE ON A HANGER. You’ll thank me later. Goodluck and enjoy this quality product. ;)"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,If I didn’t know better I’d think I was being pranked!,1,"I actually went to the Levi’s webpage and used their sizing tool, which included neck (18”) chest (52”) waist (46”) arm length (33”) and best fitting shirt mfgr (Ralph Lauren) Levi’s recommendation was an XXL, didn’t believe it so I order a 3XL. It was like I trying to put on my wife’s jacket....it was astonishing. IT HAS TO BE SIZED WRONG...sleeve ended 3” above my wrist, shoulders & arms way narrow, would not button (3“!!!) too small. My wife was laughing so hard I thought I’d have to call 911. So I guess I need a 7XL based on fit. BTW ....LL BEAN (2XL), EDDIE BAUER (3XL), and LANDSEND (3XL) POLO (3XL) all are roomy and comfortable ....what’s up with Levi’s? Now I have to figure out how to return this joke."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Fits perfect XLT,5,I am 6ft 2in 256lbs long arms. This jacket fits perfectly I bought the XLT. The quality seems very good true Levi's has plenty of room for sweater or long sleeve shirt with t under. Hope this helps the guys with monkey arms like me lol p.s I usually wear XLT t shirts and it fits nice.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Nice jacket! Finally a proud owner of a Levi Denim!,4,"Well after many years and getting answers from the question I asked about the jacket I finally got it. I originally purchased one from a wilsons department store we have around here in Mass. It was a bit to dark for my liking and the arms were pretty tight and long and the rest just felt a bit loose. I paid $70 for it. I came on Amazon because I wanted I lighter color and almost got a small. Thanks all who answered my question and said to stick with a medium and just shrink it if need be. Just got the jacket in the mail (I went with the spire color) and it fits great. I can still wear a hoodie under it and even without the hoodie it fits good. It's a little smaller than the first one I purchased which worked out perfect! It looks better and fits better. The arm length is shorter which is nice because the length is perfect now. The other jackets arms were pretty long for some reason. I guess they do very in size depending on where and when they were made. Both were made in Bangladesh but the one I ordered here on Amazon is a much better fit for me. I was worried and nervous but so glad I returned the other and got this one. Saved $20 also by buying on Amazon. I'm 5'4"" around 160lbs maybe just under that and the Medium fits me good. I'm on the stockier side (my arms aren't thin) so the arms are a tad tight but nothing that is constricting and will loosen a little over time to fit even better! Thanks again and deff go to Levi's website and use their sizing chart. It's pretty darn spot on! Haven't even worn it anywhere and I love it already! Can't go wrong with a nice denim jacket!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Fits just fine.,5,"I got it yesterday and tried it on.  Snug in the shoulders, but otherwise a perfect fit.  I feel like I'm back in high school.  My older sister cracked up laughing at me.  (That's my son on the t-shirt... long story!)"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,My favorite jean jacket!,5,"Over the years I’ve owned quite a few jean jackets, Wrangler, Lee, Ironheart, Tellason.  But, you just can’t beat a good ole Levi’s Trucker jacket.  It’s about 14 ounce denim, heavy enough to be warm and portective, but still comfortable.  And looks?  They’re the best.  All over the world, in New Zealand, Germany and Paris, you see lots of people in this exact jacket, Levi’s jean jackets.  In fact in Paris you see a million personalized versions of it.  Some deeply faded and torn.  Some blinged out with all kinds of fun decorations.  Others with patches and patterns sewed into them.  Levi’s even advertises their jackets and jeans as a blank slate for personal expression.  And that’s what it is.  They look great, fit great, and they only get better with age.From a practical stand point, these jackets are also well designed because they have two large interior pockets which can hold you wallet, phone, keys, anything.  The two handwarmer pockets on the outside are also a nice size for stuffing your hands into, or stashing your keys."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Try Before You Buy!,5,"Of the two jackets that I purchased (Welter (Blue) & Fegin (Black)), I went with a size small for both. For reference, I typically order most t-shirts and hoodies in a medium. Trucker jackets should fit you similar to a biker jacket. Tight in the arms, perfect at the shoulder, and right at your waistline. If you want it looser for your big gains, or plan on layering with a bulkier hoodie, order up a size. I highly recommend trying a Levi’s jacket on in-store (Kohl’s, Macy’s, Levi’s Outlet, etc.) before purchasing, as different colors have different material ratios. (Both of the ones pictured are 100% cotton.) I love both of mine and am confident they will last a very long time."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Sizing are tricky,4,"Not as thick as I thought I’d be. After going thru the reviews of these jacket I was confused about which I was going to get. I was on sale so I got 3 (I got the dark blue one in xs which was thick but too small to fit me so I gave it to my girlfriend, she’s 5,4 and slim and it fitted her, I got the green corduroy in size XS which was also thick and fits me surprisingly but I didn’t really like it, I then got this welter in medium and I was just right but not as thick as the others, I guess I just have to keep it to wear during the summertime) the only reason I’m giving 4star is because of the inconsistency in the sizings otherwise they’re not bad."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,This is NOT the original cotton jacket.,1,"They have been making this jacket for at least 50 years and I have been wearing these jackets for 35 years and I just got a new jacket, 100% cotton and it wouldn't button all the way and I couldn't lift my arms - AT ALL. I've been buying the same size for 20 years and I have owned 6 of these jackets in various colors and I have NEVER had one so tight that I couldn't lift my arms. To say that this runs small is an understatement.This is beyond frustrating. No stores carry these jackets anymore and we are forced to buy everything online so we can't try them on before buying. This is ridiculous."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Love It,5,"I go to a lot of concerts and I needed a jacket for building my 80's style jacket covered in patches of the bands I like. This jacket works great because 99% of the patches I have are black bordered and blend well into the jacket. The last show I went to, I was able to have a band autograph the back patch on my jacket and I received a compliment on the quality of the jacket. Metal heads unite, BUY this jacket!!!!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,A woman in a man’s jacket...,5,"Bought two of these one for myself and one for my wife. This one (medium) is hers. So I’m writing this review from the perspective of a woman wearing a mens jacket. So it’s roomy, she’s about 5’8” average build, above average bust and hips. She can wear a hoodie under it no problem. The length is great, she wanted something longer as the women’s style usually go right to the top of her hips and this is well below that point. Length over all is perfect really no complaints. Jacket fits baggy so keep that mind with chest and shoulders, however if you’re going to be wearing a hoodie under it or have a larger bust this is a huge plus. Great fit if you’re tired of women’s cuts being short or constricting."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,A favorite jacket for my lifetime.,5,"I've always loved my Levi's Jackets. In times past, I was so disappointed when I outgrew my old ones!  In some places, it's like wearing a badge and being a part of the community. Still, if you're working an a digital equipment room of some type, they usually keep the place pretty cool. This jacket is light enough to keep you comfortable without getting overly warm. Also, I live in a relatively warm climate. However, real early in the morning, it's pretty cold (for all or our north-eastern and mid-western friends that means, cold, not freezing.). So, if you do 'layers', this makes a really good under-layer along with a bit more weather-robust cold weather outer-jacket. And then, when the sun comes up, take off the outer layer and it's a really comfortable outer jacket for a few hours. I graded this one 'somewhat small' I'm a bit 'round', and hoping to 'grow into it' ... just sayin! :) Bu for my current size, I should have probably gone to the XXL. But I'm keeping this one ... it's been too long without one. I gave my last one away for the same reason ... outgrew it. This particular jacket is pretty blue, and doesn't fit right in with the 'faded look. I'm thinking it might need a little bit of the ""Spin and Marty"" treatment. (go look that one up). Still, all and all ... it's my new favorite."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,It's a Levi's trucker....the best fit!,5,"Levi's never disappoint. I had one in JHS. Always ment to purchase one as an adult, never did until I came across the advertisement in Amazon. And it was lower priced than any store online (including Macy's sales+discount). The fit is better than expected, like I tailored it myself! I'm 5'11"", 220lbs, wear L or 16.5 neck/ 33 to 34"" sleeve, depending on slim fit or not, shirts. Slightly athletic build (got lazy during beginning of Pandemic). Arm length is exact. Waist stop at waist. The feel is like real denim. The color is that rich indigo blue denim....color can be worn with any color top and pants/joggers. I've gotten many compliments from total strangers,  the two times I've worn it since purchased in October. I decided to add a lil flavor to mines. My next jacket, I will airbrush the back."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Not what they used to be!!!!!!,2,First it is not what they used to be. The jacket felt more like a shirt. Plus the collar was much thinner. My first jacket was in 1983. I lost in a nice close to 1998. That jacket was much nicer than this one. Remember that you had to wear for 3 solid months to get the crunch out of them & they were tough as nails. This also has black buttons and the sleeves were ready to burst it hurt when I bent my arms. Length was ok & waist.The majority of my shirts are XL or XXL and this was a 3x and way small. So I am 6'2 & 245 and the jacket being 3x but for me it was more like a medium or large. I don't know if I am going to be able to get so good luck to you all.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Perfect Denim Jacket, Huge Variety",5,"When I was a kid my dad had a version of the trucker jacket in all black and I always hoped to have it as an adult. It got lost over the years and I was happy to find that it is available in so many styles and colors these days. I currently own it in the dark black “Lamar” style and the “pant hero” style which is more of a faded grey/black. I love both and even bought one for my brother in a dark red canvas. We are around the same size and a small fits either of us perfectly. As expected with a denim jacket, the bottom comes to belt level/just above the belt level. This may be a problem for some people who prefer a long jacket. For those who do prefer a longer jacket I would recommend one of the (slightly more expensive) longer styles of jackets that they offer such as the utility trucker jacket or the washed cotton two pocket military style jacket.  Definitely will be buying more of these as time goes on."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Great jacket overall,5,"Bought as a gift for my fiance.  He is 6’1 and about 150-160 lbs, the Medium was nearly perfect for him - the sleeves are a tiny bit short when he stretches out his arms, but we decided to keep the Medium since it fit everywhere else and weren’t sure if the Large would really make a difference there.  The jacket is able to fit a light hoodie underneath as well, so it’s great for spring/summer/early fall.  I would recommend sizing up if you’re a bulkier person or if you want to add more layers underneath.  I ended up getting the “spire” light wash and the color was accurate, and the denim felt like good quality without being too stiff.  No missing buttons or loose threads."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Decent jacket. Order one size up!!!,4,"Pretty decent jacket for the price. I am 5'8"", 178 pounds and ordered a large after reading the reviews. Yes, this jacket does run one full size too small. Arm length is just right, slightly tight in the arms and chest/belly area. Crossing my arms is a little tight, my slight beer belly, makes the jacket somewhat tight, but I don't button that often. Other concerns are the strong chemical smell. Washed the jacket three times and it still has the smell. Will try some other washing methods as described in these reviews. I have only line dried the jacket as I'm concerned about any shrinkage. My Wrangler denim jacket is much nicer than this, and fits better in a medium, but Wrangler doesn't make a black jacket, so this Levi will work I guess."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Size up for hip hop, size down for rock n roll.",5,"I’m on the cusp of a medium and initially ordered that size. However, I was swimming in it so I returned it and sized down. The jacket has a snug fit at first and I know many people complain that these are too small. They aren’t. They are tight at first so wear it around the house for a week. The denim WILL stretch and begin to form to you. I promise it’ll start to loosen up.When in doubt: size up for hip hop, size down for rock n roll."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Still breaking it in...,5,"I’ve had this jacket for a couple of weeks now. I wear it almost daily (unless it’s raining/snowing or I’m verging on Canadian Tuxedo territory) and I love it. I’m 5’10”, ~193lbs, and I’ve got some love handles, but the Rigid Two* in Large fits me almost perfectly — I could button it if need be, though it would be a little snug; the shoulders are just a little wider than is ideal, but it’s not a problem, and the sleeves fall maybe a half inch past my wrist with my arms at my sides.It’s gotten better since I first unpacked it, but even after a couple of weeks, there’s still some creases and general stiffness. I’ve had no issues with the stitching/seams, nor have I experienced any color bleeding (but again, I keep it dry). It’s also not really warm — it’s more for style than insulation — so don’t expect this to get you thru the winter.*The one thing I would caution/advise people about is that different colors/materials can fit differently. I’ve purchased a couple of different styles, and even if they’re the same size according to the label, one might fit a little more snugly around the chest or in the arms, or it might fall above the hip or slightly below the hip. It’s almost a crapshoot whether a jacket will fit properly until you try it on."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,This is a very bad buy!,1,"I am very dissatisfied with this purchase! The seller sent me a jacket, which had already been returned to him once. The description says that this is a new jacket, but in fact it is USED. There are no original Levi's labels on the jacket. Even the Red Tab is cut off. This is usually done if the product is defective. But nothing was said about this. And further,jacket is not true to size. I usually buy size XXL and it is a little free for me. This jacket didn't even fit me. What did they send me? How is this even possible?In general, I do not recommend buying from this seller! Be careful!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Right fit for me - after some treatment,5,"I am an awkward fit, especially for jackets. I am broader in the chest/shoulders relative to most people my height/weight. I'm 5'6"", 150, and the large was very close, on arrival (I more often get medium sized shirts/jackets). Once I washed it (cold water) and dried, medium heat, it was closer. So we ran a quick rinse with hot water and dried it on high heat and that solved the sleeve length and torso length. The rest of it fit right, once I used the buttons to narrow the base of the jacket, to better match my waist.  I like the dark black of the cloth and the black thread stitching - no interest in the high contrast stitching options of other brands. I find it to be what a black jean jacket should look like - and this one fits me right. Win, win."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Fits like a Levi's Trucker Jacket,4,"The black Levi's jacket I received fit like I expected a Levi's jacket to fit.  From some of the reviews I was worried that I was going to get a tiny jacket with super-skinny arms, but I got a slightly relaxed fitting jacket with normal sized arms.  I think there must be a lot of size  and fit variation between the colors based on the reviews.  If anything the jacket I received was slightly larger than I expected.  This Black Jacket is 100% cotton and is comfortable to wear and move in.  There is a slight chemical odor from the black dye which is still there after washing."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,when marketing wins common sense,4,"So, type 3 tracker has arrived.  The quality of the fabric and seams is beyond doubt.  But with the size of a fiasco.  Always focused on the fact that the American size is one step larger than the European with the same markings.  Ordered the size of ""m"" with such calculation.  Turned out to be close, but not critical.  Looks slim, but not regular.  Made in Bangladesh, the quality of the fabric is visually good, dense, but feels a little thin. Color rigid two.Updated:After failure with the size of M ordered the size of L.  received an order today.  tracker type 3 size l, color buzi tracker.  therefore, when I wrote about the correspondence of the size tables of Europe and the United States, this is not the question. In the size L the same problem is repeated.  This tracker is tailored for persons with narrow shoulders with thin arms and a large belly and trunk.  It is a fiasco from levis.  Unfortunately.  The fabric is as ugly as possible to feel, it seems that you are in a silicone wrapper.  Everything is soft and stretchy.  Where is the feeling of denim?  So, most likely, I will try a vintage fit. If the situation repeats itself, I say ""goodbye"" to Levis"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"NOT THE SAME AS ORIGINAL COATS, BAD FIT",2,"If you’re 6’ or taller, skip it. These are Asian market sizes or miscut rejects.  For me, a store bought xl cut always fit perfectly. I ordered up from an xl to xxl per reviews and it seems like all they did was make the waist wider from a large. The sleeve cut is awful and too short. The sleeves are more narrow and fit poorly at the armpit.  I’ve worn Levi’s denim jackets for years and a the fact that reviews are all over the place lead me to believe these are rejects or Asian sizes. I should have known better when all the reviews said to order up a size!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Great jacket, classic design fro Levis",5,"I liked this jacket so much I had to return it...why? Cause I already had purchased it last year but hadn't had a chance to wear it yet because it was in the summer time! I knew I liked it and it looked familar.....ha ha! High quality material from Levis sure to impress. Levis jackets tend to run smaller than they did in the 70s but they have a flex material now that gives and wears well. Am of normal size but wanted a bigger cut to wear in the winter with a heavy hoodie underneath it and this size fit the bill perfectly. Very sharp looking and pockets forever so nothing gets lost or falls out. Buy this jacket, you'll be glad you did!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,This has become my all time favorite jacket. I wear it almost every day,5,"This has become my all time favorite jacket. I wear it almost every day, and it goes well with just about any outfit. I bought a size medium, I am 5' 11"", 175lbs, and a medium build, and this thing fit me absolutely perfectly. It feels very well constructed, I can tell that it will last for years. I used the size calculator on the official Levi's website for sizing, and I would say it was 100% spot on. I recommend using this before buying one of these jackets. I appreciate that the jacket also has an inside pocket, denim jackets I've had in the past haven't had this feature. Overall I give this 5 stars, and would recommend it above all other denim jackets."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Great Quality; Odd Coloring,5,"5 stars for the jacket; 4 stars for the odd coloring.Purchased my regular size and it fits me perfectly. Not too bulky and not too slim (but more slim fitting than most jackets). Length is perfect. Denim is heavyweight and yes, there are pockets on the inside of the jacket. Buttons are as shown in the Amazon pic (they show as silver on the Levi's web-site).The coloring is great everywhere EXCEPT for the pocket flaps on the chest. Jacket in and of itself looks nice and worn. Pockets look like someone spilled white paint on them. In the picture, there's much less of a contrast between the pockets and the rest of the jacket. In person, the jacket is darker and the pocket flaps are more white. No one in my family appreciated this element of the jacket (wife/teenage kids). Without the white, jacket would be perfect. Instead, I look like a spilled paint on myself during a drunken attempt at Bob Ross-ing. Happy little pockets...Hopefully, over time and through wear and washing, the contrast will lessen. That said, I dig this jacket.Peace."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Couldn’t be happier!,5,"I bought this jacket on a whim - and I rarely do that. I wan’t convinced I needed a denim jacket at this point, but I loved the color and the price was right, so I decided to pull the trigger. I am super pleased. I am tall and about average in weight, may be a bit on the slim side. The jacket fits perfectly and looks great. I LOVE it! It is made well, the seams look good and the overall quality is superb. The color is slightly darker from the picture on Amazon, but that was expected. It arrived ahead of time, so I am very satisfied and nicely surprised. Highly recommended."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Wash to get the perfect fit,5,"I read a fashion blog that recommended washing a few times to help break-in.Purchased the Lamar black which has 1% Elastane for stretch. Washed jacket inside out on cold three times. Washing seems to have really softened up the fabric and get the ""perfect"" fit.  Also got rid of the funk a lot of Levi's seem to have.Another trick is to put the jacket on while it's still wet so it dries to the shape of your body. I remember doing this with 501 Shrink to Fits.F"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Classic Look,5,"If you like the classic denim look of Levi's, then you'll love this jacket.  It provides comfortable warmth on cool/chilly days.  I'm a pretty regular sized guy, I'm 6' tall and weigh 165 lbs, but I purchased XL.  It fits me just the way I like which is just a little ""baggy"".  The sleeves are just the right length.  Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase.  Just be aware that you'll probably need to add a size when you order this."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,I Love Levi's Jeans,5,"I Love Levi's Jeans Products, But ... I Always Seem To Encounter Size Differences On Some Of Their Same Products, Like With Jacket. Last Time I Was At A Dept. Store ... I Tried On Several Of Levi's Jackets And Coats, None Had The Correct Labeling. Last Year I Purchased A Black Denim Levi's Jacket In 2XL And It Fit Like A Medium, So I Ordered One In 3XL And It Fit Perfectly, Even Before I Washed It. So, I Ordered This Dame Jacket In White And Honestly, It Fits Like A 5XL ... Really Big! I Washed It And Threw It In A Hot Dryer,And It Still Fit Pretty Much The Same. But What Can You Do? It's Unfortunate For Me, But Fortunate For A Needy Disabled Veteran, Which Is Where I Donated It At The Nearby VA Hospital Where I Love Nearby At, Since I Hate *Doing Returns ...( * In- Store or By Mail ). I Guess, I'll Have Better Luck Next Time."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Stylish Original Levi’s Trucker Jacket,5,"Levi’s trucker jacket is the classic that will never go out of style. With endless pairing options, it is the perfect casual jacket for spring and fall, mid-layer for winter, and a back-up to keep us warm in some cool summer night. I have denim jackets from other brands but the Levi’s always fit me the best. Amazon sells the original and authentic Levi’s as I have checked the red tag, the patch, and the button numbers to make sure they are authentic. I have the Hype Stretch and the Spires, and both came in good condition and looked great! The price was cheaper than the Levi’s website. Couldn’t be happier.For reference, I am 5’8” at 153lbs with average slim build, not skinny and not athletic. A size S fits me perfectly. I don’t have huge biceps so I am able to fit the narrow sleeves, which is more stylish. If you have huge biceps, may want to consider size up accordingly."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Poor sizing,2,"For an XL , awfully small and tight and arms too short. I have L’s that fit better."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Love this Jean Jacket!  Yessss Get it!,5,"Jacket fits very tight and well fitted. If you want it loose go up a size. Will keep you warm like a sweater.  Its youthful and looks great once you put it on!  Remember to know your size before you buy.  If you like it tight and fitted stay with your current size, if you want it loose go up one size!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Runs small.,2,"Be aware, the jacket runs really small. Even if I were to buy another just to try it on, the sleeves are really narrow. No room for layering at all. I have owned several Trucker Jackets. Back in the day, the sleeves were generous, possibly to a fault maybe. I used to fit like, three sweat shirts under a small. Well, those days are gone by the looks of this narrow Trucker. The small trucker that I bought, and I do take a small, (5' 10"", 140 lbs.) I think that I may try a medium, just to try it on, and probably give the least favored trucker to some body else."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"XL Rigid Two is a Beautiful Jacket, it looks good and I look good in it.",5,"I'm a newbie to Levi's and I bought the jacket in XL because of the ""xl is too small, too tight""  comments, mine showed up a little big for me. I'm tall 6'3, 210ish,  V shape build .  The RIGID TWO fits me , well....not snug. Comfortable , with a little more room. I can wear my large size, western shirt underneath, no problem.  I have different  truckers that are XL and are not roomy like the Rigid Two XL. It may shrink after I wash it but I haven't,  so I have yet to see.What I'm starting to understand is that every Levi's jacket color/ style, MAY have a different measurement.  I love my new Rigid Two Levi's jacket  and i love Levi's jeans..the sizing is subjective  but Levi's can't please everyone. To put it simply...its a beautiful jacket, great color looks good and I look good in it. I look forward to breaking in this bad boy. ( Used Prime arrived in 3 days. Thank you)"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Order a size or two bigger,3,"6’2 285.  Chest 52. Waist 41. Sleeve measured from the back of my neck, down the shoulder, to just past the wrist is 36”.  I bought a 3xl and it was too short.  Reach for something and the sleeves came halfway up my forearm.  The quality of the jacket is nice.  Very nice.  I hated having to return this.  Order a size bigger."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Great Jacket,5,This is a great jacket with a good fit.  It is probably 1% bigger than I’d like but it is the right size.  I normally wear a large and I ordered a large.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Perfect fit for my 6’2” husband,5,My husband loves this jacket! I fits him perfectly in all ways including arm length. My husband is 6’2” 260 pounds. I’d recommend this to anyone who is around the same size
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Classic Look And Get Normal Size,4,"I got this in an XL and it's a bit loose for me. I should have gotten a Large, as normal. I'm 5 ' 10"" and 195 Lbs, medium build. I got the XL, washed it, medium heat in the dryer--I was hoping it would shrink. The only shrinkage was in the arms, which was not ideal. So yeah, it's pre-shrunk. If you like how it fits when you get it, just wash it in cold and hang dry always. In all, it fits pretty good with room in the chest and belly area. If I wear a hoodie under it, it's perfect. However, these jackets look best kind of snug. Great look though!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Sleeve too tight.,2,"Something about this jacket is not right. I have been wearing Levi's, as well as other mfrs, jean jackets every year since the mid 70's. You cannot wear a hoodie under this jacket, the sleeves are too tight around the biceps. I take a Med/Large, ( bought XL ), I've always bought one size up with never a problem in the past. What has changed? Are Levi's now based on Bangladesh vs USA arms? I would expect the jacket to maybe be tight around my belly, but not my arms; because I am neither muscular, nor obese. As for the quality of the material and hardware, seems to be in line with what I expect for a Levi's Jacket."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Nice jacket, color a little off",4,"I like this jacket, is quite comfortable. Its fabric is rather thin and a little stretchy, so its ideal for those not too cold days. I'm about 178 cms tall, and heavy, so I bought x-large, it fits me well except for the sleeves which are a little too long (something that I'm used to due to my complexion). The thing to keep in mind is that the real color is a bit different to the one shown in the pictures, as you can see in the photos below, the first one was taken with daylight only, the jacket appears darker and less ""yellowish"" than advertised. The second photo is more like it, but keep in mind that was taken with daylight + lots of white warm light on it."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,I am a child of the 80s,5,"Close enough; grew up in the 70s but started college in '82. I always had a denim jacket. They haven't really been ""in style"" recently, but I decided to treat myself. I wear 2xl shirts so bought this in  3xl. Fits perfectly, including the sleeve length (which is usually too long for me, so if you have long arms go a size up, at least.)"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Great casual jacket, but not for CCW",5,"Fantastic jacket, just enough stretch to be comfortable yet keep stiff denim look and shape. Perfect for warm weather with chilly nights like northern CA. Originally bought it since I read some reviews mentioning it can work for CCW but it doesn't. The inner pocket is small and open at the top, and will be pulled down unevenly by any heavy item in it. Kept it just as a casual jacket. Would buy more it there were more colors."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Well made indeed.,5,"Hi guys.  This Levi Trucker jacket was made in Bangladesh. I want to tip my hat to the fine workmanship, and care that whoever sewed this jacket together, took to complete such a high quality product. Reminds me of how these jackets where made at the San Francisco Levi Plant many many years ago. Thank You for your integrity and fine taloring . I will wear this Levi Trucker Jacket with pride.  Cheers from Texas ."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Tailoring Is Off!,2,"I am 66 years old and have been wearing Levi's jackets since my youth.  I bought and returned 2 of these jackets because the arms are so tight in the biceps that I could not raise my arms.  I am very disappointed with this.  I don't know why Levi's has started making them this way.  After returning the second jacket for the too-tight biceps fit, I gave up and have not ordered another.  I will just have to see what the brick and mortar shops have to offer.  May have to go to another brand."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Solid jacket,4,"Originally ordered 3 xl, was a little tight, so I exchanged it for a 4 xl and it was a lot better yet still snug. Also the size of the shoulder area increased a lot which makes it look a little funny but over all a nice jacket."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,As good as ever,5,This was my favorite jacket for years. It got lost in a move and I was never able to afford to buy another one. Hit a half price sale and was able to get it for a  steal!!!!  Oddly enough they haven’t messed with a great thing and it’s as awesome as I remember. Now we just have to get rid of this beastly summer heat so I can start breaking it in so it doesn’t look look so blasted “new” any more lol. I am in absolute heaven!!!!
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Amazing fit and feel,5,"I am 6’5”, 235 pounds, athletic build and most of my height is in my torso. This makes clothes shopping a nightmare as the large sizes do not even cover my belly button but the XL sizes have way too much extra material around the chest and torso. However the XL size of this jacket fit perfectly. The cut is slim around the torso but long enough that I don’t look like I am wearing a crop top."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Levi Quality!,5,Great Levi Quality! Love the look an the color is just right for me. Had one when I was a young man couldn’t let this get away Cyber Monday. I’m 5’11” about 200 lbs an I got the X-large an it is a tad more snug than I would like around the chest an shoulder area. No way I’m going to get a sweatshirt under it. With that said it really is a good quality Jean jacket that looks good and I believe will last a long time. May want to go a size up if you intend to wear a sweatshirt or hoodie under it.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Size up from what the size chart recommends for a comfortable fit,5,"I am typically a women's size large (roughly a men's size small) and according to the size chart should've ordered a small. I followed the recommendation of the reviews and sized up and am happy I did. The medium could barely be buttoned around my butt (38 inches in circumference). If you a prefer a looser fit, size up 2 sizes ladies. I didn't find that the jacket was too long, only stiff and heavy because it's real denim."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Awesome denim jacket - would highly recommend,5,"Fantastic trucker jacket with a little bit of stretch added in. The material is very soft, but noticeably less substantial that the typical Levi’s trucker jacket, which is what was expected according to the product listing. I’d compare it more with a softer, less thick, almost sweater-like quality material than the typical denim jacket, but it’s still heavier is than a sweater or hoodie. The sizing is pretty spot-on, though it runs a tad small and is ultimately a little more fitted than some of the other Levi’s trucker jackets I’ve picked up, but honestly their jacket sizing can be all over the place a good chunk of the time. So, this one probably will run a little slimmer or smaller than most of their denim jackets, which is a good thing in my opinion, but it’s still pretty close to most of the others that fit somewhat slim.Overall, great jacket, and I definitely recommend it - just don’t expect it to be warmer and heavier than it’s meant for."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Order a size up,4,"Levi's Mens Trucker JacketStyle # 723340130Color: Medium Stonewash100% CottonNon-stretch DenimMade in BangladeshThis jacket is slim in the shoulders and arms.  If you want this jacket to fit like a shirt, I suggest you order your normal size.  If you want this jacket to wear like a jacket, order a size up.  I usually wear a XL in jackets because I like the option to layer if needed.  I ordered this jacket in a XL and after a wash, the jacket was like wearing a large shirt.  It was very uncomfortable and restricting (this is 100% cotton, no Elastane).I returned the XL and ordered a XXL.  After a wash, this jacket fits like a slim XL, so I will not be layering with this jacket.  Length in the arms and over all jacket length are not compromised or too long.  All in all, this jacket will be perfect for spring days/nights.I'm sure Levi's is like most companies where their manufacturing is no longer in the U.S., so the product quality could be questionable."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,This jacket STINKS!!!,2,"First of all, my husband is a Medium.  He purchased a medium which was too small.  He then purchased a large which fit great, but he missed the looser fit of older Levi’s jackets.  I purchased an XL for his birthday.  It fits great but there is one major problem.  This jacket STINKS!  Really bad.  We washed it twice.  Once with vinegar and once with baking soda.  Not only does it still reek, but it has faded considerably.  We are now giving it one more soak in white vinegar and water.  The other two jackets did not smell as bad as this one.  Not sure what the deal is but we are disappointed.  The jackets should be treated ahead of time.  We shouldn’t even have to wash them.  My husband didn’t want to at first because he like how black it was.  Now it is faded and still stinks!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Check the fit,4,"The jacket is very nicely made and comfortable except across the back of the shoulder and under the arms when you cross your arms. If you have broad shoulders go up a size, you can always exchange it but I rather take the chance of going up and having it fit than to go with what you think your normal jacket size is and ""have"" to exchange it. It's a really nice looking jacket and goes with just about any style you choose"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Garbage,1,Garbage. I dont know what the deal with levis jean jackets is anymore but theyre garbage. Grab one your size in the 80s and 90s and it would always feel like it was made just for you. Last 10 plus years the chest and waist are like 2 sizes too big and the arms are so tight its like 2 sizes too small. And my body hasnt changed. My levi jean jackets from the 90s and 00s still fit perfect excluding the fact that theyre wearing out. Does levis think people wear 3 thick winter sweaters with the sleeves all cut off? Or whos their model? A cartoon character. For the past 10 years every time i go into a clothing store i try on levi jean jackets. All made for fat people with anorexic arms. Figured id buy one on amazon. Swimming in the body of the jacket and cant even bend my arms in the sleeves. Its like the body is a double xl and the sleeves are a small.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Nice Jean Jacket, Especially for the Price",5,"Nice jean jacket, especially for the discounted price I paid when it was on sale.  I'm a fairly big guy with broad shoulders, so I ordered an XXL, which is what I typically wear.  Ultimately, I think that was probably was the correct choice because of the fit at the shoulders.  The fit in the chest and waist are just a bit looser than I had anticipated, however.  This is common problem, and one that I'm fairly used to at this point, so I wouldn't say that I was really surprised or disappointed.  I might might have been if I was someone who was expecting it to really narrow around the waist, however."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Don't believe these nincompoops about sizing,5,"5'10.5 160lbs, I ordered two, one in XL the other a large. The XL works as intended to layer with a hoodie, but is just a little too big for my particular tastes. The large is also still a little too big for just a tshirt. So, if you wear a medium and just want to wear a tshirt and/or flannel, get a medium. If you want to layer a light-medium weight hoodie, order a size up."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Disappointedly too tight.,1,"Very disappointed. I used to love Levi's for their quality. I bought a black denim jacket from Levi's before and loved it. Bought a new one recently and was disappointed to feel how uncomfortably tight it was on the arms and chest. This was a size large. I'm not sure if this skinny jeans thing is supposed to be ""cool"" or if Levi's is saving money by using less material and charging the same. A jeans jacket for men should be made to fit men."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Nice jacket, initial impression",5,"I didn’t realize it was raw denim, not that that’s a bad thing, I actually prefer it. This is my first denim jacket and it’s kind of surprising to me how nice it is. The fit is perfect, accounting for the slightly slim fit all denim jackets are said to have. Sleeves are a little long, falling at the middle of my hand and I have long arms, but I’m also a 2X so I’m used to that happening."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Way too big,3,"Nice jacket but way too big. Ordered a medium which is the size I get everything in. Sleeves are very long, shoulders are very wide and the chest is very broad. Could wear a hoodie under this but that's not really what a denim jacket is made for.Cuffs also only have one button to adjust size and I can still slip my hands through them while closed. Trying a small"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Jean jacket?? More like a poorly made jean SHIRT.,1,"It may look like a jacket but it feels like a jean SHIRT. This so called ""jean jacket"" is so thin you can't even call it a jacket with a straight face and the quality isn't very good either. It's definitely not worth the price they're asking. I've had jean jackets through out the years and they've never been this thin. It really is a big disappointment."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Poor Quality Levi Jacket,1,"This jacket was poorly manufactured.  The sleeves were sewn inside of the jacket frame, and are incredibly narrow for a Large seized jacket.  The effect is that, if you have skinny arms and can even get them into the sleeves, they bind and severely constrict arm movement.  Further, I have an older and very comfortable Levi jacket that was manufactured about 7 years ago, and the weight & density of the new fabric appears to be about 60% of my older jacket.  Levi definitely cut corners on this product to save costs, and if this product is any indication, their quality control is awful. I won't even waste my time to send it back - I'm going to use it as a shop rag."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Good denim jacket for the price.,5,"Really like the jacket, I've got broad shoulders and bigger arms so most jackets and button up shirts do not fit well in those areas too. I usually wear XL t-shirts but with the jacket, I had ordered a 3xl. Still slightly snug in those areas, but that's more my build more than the jacket, why I put fits as expected. Still fits, still wearable, I like it a lot."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,First Levi Trucker Jacket Since High School,5,"It’s been some 50 years since I owned and wore a Levi Trucker Jacket.  I ordered a XXL (2XL) as I generally wear XL clothing, and go one size larger in order to wear sweat shirts and sweaters underneath.  The size and quality is perfect.  It also has inside pockets that work well for carrying my iPhone SE.  I could have saved money on a more generic brand, but Levi’s fit works and the craftsmanship is evident.  Very happy with the Amazon price as well"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Love it!,5,"I have been looking for a RED Levi’s Trucker jacket for a long time... they were never RED....always something close to Red...but notRED...the search is over! A true RED Levi’s Trucker...I am 6ft tall and 190lbs... I have several Levi’s Truckers and XL fits me perfectly.Jacket is a little stiffer than a regular blue denim jean jacket, but not in any way uncomfortable..Only worn it out a few times... each time someone said “ I like your jacket!”Works for me!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Great jean jacket from Levi's,5,"Absolutely love it. I haven't worn a jean jacket since my late teens.  Recently wondered, at 41, why the heck not?  I loved my jean jacket in the spring and autumn back then. So I shopped around and viola, Levi's Big and Tall (3X), Danica style Blue denim (with mild distressing and a few spots of acid-washed tones).  Fits as expected and I am instantly in love with jean jackets all over again.  Was at my door in 2 days thanks to Prime shipping too."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,True to size??,2,"After retiring my 20yr old jacket, I ordered my normal size.  I wound up returning it for the next size larger and figured the first one was a fluke.  I am now returning this one for two sizes larger.  Funny because I bought the Sherpa jacket a week prior in my normal size and it was a perfect fit.  They said ""true to size"" but that's nonsense.  No complaint with the construction quality so I'll revise this review once I have figured out their secret decoder for sizing.  Maybe someone in Bangladesh just messed up their metric conversion.."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,If you wear a 4xl in T-shirt’s you’ll probably want to get a 3xl jacket,4,One of the better big guys jean jackets. Fits as good as it’s gonna. I’m happy with my purchase! Cut the sleeves off and it’s perfect
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Runs small/slim. Long arms.,4,"For some reason I feel like the denim material is thinner (especially collar) and smaller then the same jacket I got in dark indigo from kohl’s. It was cheaper on here that’s why I got it but with this size small I’m unable to fit a zip up hoody underneath like I am still able to do with the blue one (same size) for extra warmth, as it does not provide much of it. Either way it looks still great and feel great with just a shirt or button up underneath."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Good looking, but sizing is way small",2,"I am 6ft1in and 242lbs, and have worn XXL for all of my clothes for 20 years. I took all of my measurements before ordering this jacket, and found that XXL is exactly my size here too. But when it arrived today, it was very tight in the arms and shoulders. I couldn't even lift my arms up to shoulder height with it on. It fits like a large maybe.It is a beautiful jacket though, so I had my wife try it on and it's a bit big and long on her, but she will be able to layer under it this fall so we will keep it. Guess I will have to look at other companies to get a jean jacket that fits me."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Good unisex fit, color was too dark",3,"I'm a woman, 5'1"" and around 110lb, and I wanted a denim jacket but I hate traditional women's-fits. To be specific, I hate:-Feminine tapers (like at the waist)-How short or long or baggy a jacket can be depending on whatever current trend is happening-The lack of pockets (why can't we just have some decent pockets???)-Material is often thin, cheap, and poorly put together-Bonus: If you find a nice jacket, go ahead and turn that sucker right around because there will something stupid embroidered on it. I kid you not, I found the most perfect bomber jacket once and I almost dropped $50 on it, but I turned it around and it said ""GIRL GANG"" on the back.Anyways.I got the Colusa/Stretch (x-small) and honestly, it fit well the way it came. It was maybe a just a little baggy, but it was good for fitting layers underneath it. I ended up shrinking mine in the dryer and it fit perfectly (snug around the torso if I button it, bottom of the jacket goes just to my belt-line on mid-rise pants, sleeves go down to my mid-hand/knuckles). The material is definitely sturdy, a little stiff at first, nothing flimsy at all. There are 4 (four!) pockets! And I'm not including the two breast pockets. There are 2 on the inside, 2 on the outside, each of them big enough to hold a wallet and a large phone.However, there was a problem.The color of the wash I bought should have been medium-dark blue (but a muted blue). What I received was a super dark blue, nothing medium-wash or muted about it. It was basically a midnight blue. It is possible they sent me the wrong jacket, but I know another reviewer had this issue too. I ended up putting it through a bunch of hot water washes, even put it through a couple bleach washes at one point, and got it faded to a more acceptable color.Denim CAN be faded, and it will fade on its own over time, but you can speed along the process (look online for methods). It ended up working out okay, but it would have been great if they could have just sent me the color I bought."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Be aware if you have an athletic build.,4,"I stand 5’10 and I weigh 200-205. I go to the gym a lot and my measurements are atypical, so it's often difficult to find a great fit for me. I usually like to wear large tops, but after reading a few reviews, I went with extra large. It's still tight in the chest and shoulders, and very tight in the arms. I can work with that because denim will give a little bit and mold to your body. The issue is in the stomach/waist area. It is way too big. I am going to try take it to my tailor to see if it can be taken in some. Other than that, it is a great looking jacket and appears to be nice quality."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Nice jacket but has a strange smell,3,"I normally wear between a small and medium.  I ordered the medium and it fits just about right for me.  I'm 5'6"" and weigh 155lbs.  The denim is stretch so it's also comfortable and the sleeves are plenty long.  One issue that I hope will go away is the smell.  The material has a strong chemical, moth-ball smell.  My guess is that it's from whatever the stretch material is in the denim.  The smell is still strong after one washing so I'm throwing it in the wash again to see if it starts to go away or diminish.  Hope so because I like the jacket."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Medium has short sleeves and Large has large waist. Not for tall slender people ;(,2,"This jacket should be fine for average height people, but it is not for tall slender people. There is always the following issue with Levi's jackets: the sleeves are too short. So either I have to order the medium that has a perfect cut but sleeves that are too short, or I have to order a large that has the right sleeve length but a large waist. God please Levi's start making cuts that fit tall slender people! I'm 6'2"" and weight 170lbs."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Child's sizing!,1,"This must have been made for children. I don't understand how anyone over 5'2 could fit in it, and it's a men's jacket. I'm extremely thin and somewhat tall and I ordered a medium (I'm normally a small), the thing sat at my belly button and barely closed."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Great timeless, casual look and perfect weight.",5,"I normally wear a medium shirt and so I ordered a medium. Fit perfect for me. Just slightly snug but I would say it is more of a tailored fit. A trucker style jacket isn’t meant to be very “roomy” inside. My chest is exactly 40 inches. Sleeves and length were perfect. If you are a bit on the heavier side maybe order a size up.  But me, I’m very happy with this purchase and with the look and color."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Great birthday gift!,5,I purchased this jacket for my husband’s birthday.  He had never asked for one but I have one.  Normally he doesn’t get excited about things I buy for him. He loves this jacket.  It fit perfectly!  Great quality. Heavy but flexible. Washes well.  Big points for me!
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,P E R F E C T  T R A N S A C T I O N  ! ! ! !  ô¿ô,5,WOW !  100% !!!!  This is REALLY NICE JACKET - YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER ONE - I BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR - NOT A CHEAP AND FLIMSY CHEESE JACKET - BETTER THAN EXPECTED FOR SURE - I always found it hard to find this kind of jacket in both on-line and in a store so I REALLY SURPRISED when I received It How Good Quality Has Been Put Into This Jacket - I DON'T SEE HOW ANYONE COULD BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS JACKET !!!!!
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Tailored fit for noodle armed people,3,"It was a sick deal for a Jean jacket that I was stoked to catch --I've habitually cut the sleeves off of my denim for too long--but I get the jeezeless thing and while the body fits perfectly the sleeves are so narrow that my non-yoked, not-at-all-jacked arms fill them to Point where it might become a vest.Bummer.Update 10/24/19I bought another just to see if they've gotten any better.Nope.The material on this one is almost half as thick as my previous jacket and while the sleeves fit and the cut is nice, it's basically a fashion statement and not at all the protective layer that I grew up with."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Very First Trucker Jacket,5,"My Very First Trucker jacket an had to go with the original makers. Definitely very satisfied with this jacket fits just right I’m 5’6 215 pounds i was very confused on what size to get since some people say get one size bigger and some say get your exact fit. So what I did was get my exact fit XL I wasn’t trying to get anything that would be to lose on me, fits just right I can even put a hoodie or slim zip up jacket and still can button it up great product overall."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Built for small, small men",1,"I've had a Levi's LARGE denim jacket for many, many years.  That jacket has an arm circumference at mid bicep of 19"".  The EXTRA LARGE I just returned has an arm circumference at mid bicep of 16"".  Fits in the chest okay, but still smaller than the old large.  Unfortunately my chosen sport involves lifting heavy things.  My arm barely fits the jacket sleeve.  Bending the arm at the elbow or reaching forward is a no-go.  Might it be that men are now shrinking?"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Finally, perfect fit.",5,"I am a 5’5 125lb male and the XS (EXTRA SMALL) fits perfectly. I bought this to sew embroidered patches onto. With light wear, it’s been holding up well, though I haven’t had to wash it yet. If you need to wash it, turning it inside out and placing it inside a garment bag, then washing on cold should do the trick."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Jacket has huge Levi logo across the shoulders.,1,"I did not even try it on once I realized Levis had placed their logo in large letters across the shoulders.  If they want me to advertise their products, they can pay me for it instead of charging me.  I found a less expensive (by $25), identical jacket from Calvin Klein on Amazon.  Fits perfectly and better quality than Levis (only a small patch with their name on the waist)."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Perfect for tall guys who are big but not fat,5,"I'm 6'5""/196cm, big shoulders, muscles with some fat. These work really well, I'd recommend going with a size down if tall. I ordered xl tall and XXL tall, just so I could see which would work for me. I went with XXL tall since it's 98% cotton and can shrink it to fit me. The xl tall fit snug, but I like to layer so went with XXL tall. Order multiple sizes, easy return to send back the one that doesn't fit, as Levi's is NOT consistent with sizing"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Colusa Looks Much Better in Person,5,"Originally bought a different one with more distressing but ultimately didn't like that one and returned it for the Colusa, which looks pretty bland in the picture but is a more ""classic"" look. The product has a bit more distress and is overall a more vibrant blue color than the picture suggests. Definitely looks much better in person and I'm super happy I made the switch over. If you're looking for a very attract yet classic look, Colusa's definitely an easy recommendation."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,He Loves it,5,"The XL jacket fits my 6' 240pound husband perfect.  He 'requires' an inside pocket for his wallet, and the pockets in the jacket fit the bill.  The jacket looks really nice.  The jacket washed up nice on warm water; I wash jeans and jean jackets inside out and add white vinegar to the rinse to keep the color from fading too fast.  I would buy this jacket again."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Jacket runs quite small. Think about sizing up.,3,"Ended up having to return the jacket due to the sizing being a little weird. The sleeves are quite tight and narrow; length was as expected, though. Jacket is also quite short - sat above my belt line, which was a little strange in my opinion. Chest and torso fit okay, but only if I had a t-shirt on. Put on anything other than just a single shirt and it was a little too tight to move.I typically wear my clothes on the more fitted and slim side, and small is my normal size in most clothes. I have no idea how the medium fits, but the small in this was just a tad bit on the small side to be comfortable."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Like a custom made jacket!,5,"I have never had a jacket fit as well as my Levi Trucker. It’s Unbelievable! The arm length, perfect. Shoulder length, perfect. Chess fit, perfect! It’s like this jacket was custom made for me. Sometimes I’ll take a size L and other times I’ll take a size XL. This jacket is a size XL. You might consider going one size larger than you normally wear."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Bleach dye to get lighter color!,4,"Great product! One caution: the colors aren't exactly as picture, but that is to be expected. I got what they list as the Spire it was a bit too dark for me. (3/5 for color accuracy.)The sizing is simple if you follow the size chart given. I recommend using the chest size plus the waist size to choose what size fits you best. If you are uncertain of your measurements then go for the size you typically wear in T-shirts and how you like the it fit. (5/5 for Size)Now if the lighter color you want isn't available, don't giveup; get the next closest shade & bleach dye it to get the lighter shade."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,I sized up,5,"In my experience these run a little tight and might even shrink after a few washes/dry cycles.I am 5' 10"" 150 and I usually wear a M, but I sized up to an L. It is a bit wider this way, but over time it will size to a perfect M. I tried on my dad's L he bought 20 years ago and it fits perfectly--though I hope it won't take that long! Levi's jean jacket, what more can you say...its an American classic."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Classic look, great fit.",5,I bought an XL and it fits perfect. I wear a 46 R suit jacket cut slim. This jacket fits like it's tailored.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Love the Spire Color!,5,"im 5'11 maybe 6' foot around 150-160 lb tall slim build.My arms are really long about 34-35 so i was nervous about the sleeve length on the size Medium. But it fit so perfect, definitely form fitting and stylish. I had previously ordered a large which was too big for me, but the medium was perfect.The color spire is such a classic look, and the quality is really good as well. Not a heavy jacket but its also not a thin one. Just right. Definitely recommend"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,The only jacket I'll need,5,"Originally I tried different sizes of this jacket at the store, so I knew I was an 2XL. If you want to know your size, I'm 46L in Blazers. I do slightly fit the XL, but I cannot perform a hugging motioning that particular size.The jacket is everything as expected to be like wearing a pair of jeans but for the upper half of your body. It's nothing to really keep warm, as I'm well aware of that fact from the beginning. It works very well with a thin hoodie that they also sell at a Levi store or a button down shirt.I'm no biker, but if you want an alternate to wearing a leather jacket and not have the extensive motorcycle gear, it would be this and probably a spine protector.The jacket is thin denim, which is like jeans. I suggest trying one out at a store before ordering online. At stores you might find this particular jacket going for $90+, but here it's much cheaper. When I was younger they were cheaper, so this jacket doesn't change but the price will."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Well-made jacket,5,"This has held up very well for me through a good bit of outdoor use. Make sure when sizing this item you use the measurement scheme listed with the item. I normally wear a medium, but this sizing placed me at a large. The large fits perfectly - go with the recommended size not what you would go with typically."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Take the size warnings serious!,1,"I didn't believe the numerous size warnings, but they were correct. I'm a muscular person at 5'10"" 215 lbs and I litterally could not fit my arms into the sleeves on a 2X. Seriously, if you're a big or muscular individual, you're not going to be pleased with the fit. It's way too tight. I personally would need a 4X or 5X. If your a super slim person, this jacket would work for you. Not the Levi's of old that's for certain."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Levi's used to mean quality... now it just means you pay more for less.,3,"Levi's has been a bit of a fashion standard for most of my life.  Unfortunately, their quality has been in decline over the past decade.  Having owned several Levi's jackets, I knew what to expect from the fit, and this one met those expectations.  Unfortunately, the fabric had some flaws in it.I bought a Goodthreads brand jacket to compare, and if that jacket had better color, I would have kept it over this one (and saved $25!)"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Fits perfect,5,"This is actually made for a man.  The arms are long and shoulders fit.  I bought my husband a 3xl.  He is 5'11"" and weights 300lbs."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Perfect fit,5,I had previously bought a Levi's trucker jacket for my husband but it was way too small. I even ordered two sizes up because of the reviews and it was still too small. This one is perfect. I did order a size up because he likes to wear a hoodie under it but it was perfect!
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Cut is really small.,1,I don't know what is up at levis but I wear a large men's shirt and the levis trucker jacket is way too small. The arms are so skinny I couldn't even bend them at the elbow. Look at the photos in the ad. Seriously your arms can't move and I'm not a big guy. 6 ft 180lbs 35 inch waist. No gut.I went to a local western store and they had some but all sizes were way too tight in the arms. I'm thinking they must be using Chinese models. Think they are made there.Ended up buying a wrangler.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,They may as well not even label the size on these jackets.,3,"For some reason, the sizing on Levi's denim jackets are ridiculously inaccurate. I've tried on 2xs which were huge in one style, and barely squeezed into a 5x in others, all Levi. This was no exception. I still can't tell you which size I am as I have tried a 2x and a 3x and both were incredibly small, despite me being 2x for shirt size. I gave up on looking, because none of their sizes were relative to any other available products on the market, or other products in their repertoire. This could be the best jacket ever made, but good luck finding your size."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Nice jacket, sleeves too narrow",3,"Overall, I liked the looks and comfort of the jacket.  But the sleeves were too narrow and tight.  I would have to say that I have average to even smaller sized arms for a guy.  Bending my arm was uncomfortable.  Holding the sleeves up to an older Levi's jean jacket from the 90's they were 1-2 inches slimmer.  There was a little stretch in the material.  But not enough to make it comfortable to wear.  I ended up returning it."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Great If I Was 8 Feet Tall,1,"If I only had a very abnormally long torso... this would be perfect! The bottom of the jacket hit my upper thigh. In the pictures it hit at just above the butt. If you wanna show off the goods, you won't do it in this jacket. It's more like an '80's oversized sweater your girlfriend would wear. Shapeless and loose and why?"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"A little hot, but Girlfriend approved!",4,"My girlfriend told me “every man needs a denim jacket” so I got this one. I love it, but it’s VERY warm. I do not recommend this as a spring/summer jacket. For Fall/Winter I’m sure it’s great. The hunt for a light jacket continuesAlso, she was right. I objectively look GREAT in this, and it’s hard to imagine how you couldn’t. Definitely get a pair of non-blue jeans so you don’t accidentally put on a Canadian Tuxedo"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Sexy again!,5,"I really like the fit of the jacket.  I am a bigger guy and the 2XL fits perfectly.  Wife got excited when I put it on.  She said I looked good in it. I must have been ugly before the jacket, lol.  Therefore, 5 stars!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Nice jacket,5,"Couldn't find this jacket in my size at the local stores, so bought it here for the same price.  Size medium fits perfect (5'11 180lbs, athletic).  The Large size was a little baggy and from what I've seen, you want it to be fitted so it will stretch to your body over time.  Here's some advice for finding the right fit:  go try these on in person first.  The dark rinse (made in Bandgladesh) fits perfect, but when I tried on Mediums in the corduroy and Sherpa lined version (Made in China) of the same jacket they felt much too tight.... So there could be some variation depending on what style you get and where it's made.  Anyway, I'm glad I went ahead and bought the Levi's brand... it looks well made, stylish, and should last for a very long time."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Wrong Item, very disappointed.",1,"I've bought light blue jean jacket, as you can see on the picture, I've received cheaper dark grey model, see photos.Very disappointed, never will buy again from this brand, shame."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Nice stretch denim acid-wash Genuine Levi’s jacket!,5,"The photos don’t do the acid-wash justice. It’s definitely acid-wash but subtle, in my opinion. Classy, retro 80s vibes, very San Junipero. 10/10 would recommend! It’s substantial in weight for stretch denim, maybe a 14oz weight. (Most stretch denim is 9 to 11 oz in fabric weight). Nice diverse piece for my wardrobe! (I own a few denim jackets, leather too. It’s Jacketpalooza. Whatever. Don’t judge.) Anyhoo, it’s genuine Levi’s not made in the US anymore, Bangladesh or something, but hey, it’s a well done piece."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Too small,1,"I normally wear a 2XLT and bought this as 3XLT so I could wear a sweatshirt under it and it is way too small.  It is tall but doesn’t seem to have any extra length and everything else runs small.  I would say the 3XLT fits like and XLT.  It also has an obnoxious odor to it, the black dye really smells bad.  This jacket is not typical Levis fit or quality."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,I should of read the reviews.,3,"Warning*Warning*WarningI am 6ft, 225 pounds and the XXL will button but that's it. It's a little ""stretchy"", but there is no way I can wear a hoddie underneath and be able to button it close (which I like doing since high school). The last (3) XXL I've own, were always baggy and was able to wear the hoddie comfortably. If you are similarly built like me, order the XXXL. With that said, I still like the jacket. It's more cut with the modern look of ""barely fitting"" as I like to call it.HEED MY WARNING, it's sized smaller than previous version."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Time will tell, but not the same ole jacket",4,"I've been buying these jackets for over 10 years for punk vests, just a heads up these say they're 1% elastane on the label (2% says the website). It feels MUCH stretchier than the ones of old. Is that better or worse? I suppose time will tell. I also bought an XL and an XLT to see what the difference is and if there is one, it's nothing I can tell. Perhaps the sleeves are longer, but I'll be cutting those off so..."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,The jacket is not in proportion.,1,The sleeves did not match the size of the jacket. The jacket was a large and did not fit the man.  I tried th ed jacket on and I couldn't put my arms in the sleeves and I wear a medium.  Also the seam on one of the sleeves was not sewn correctly.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Hadn't bought a denim jacket in years! Like it!,5,"Great quality cotton, like the color (slightly faded) and the fit. Got it on sale and liked it even more as a deal. Quality Levi's jacket made in Bangladesh. Makes me think of the late George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh whenever I put it on. Check it out."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,goods for fat shorty,3,"I ordered 2 jackets of sizes m and l, they turned out to be of different quality, the red label on the pocket on the jacket l contains Levi's inscription, on the jacket of size M only R is in a circle, the edges of the fabric on jacket L in the button area are worn too much, M is sewn more carefully. The sleeves on M are short for height 186, and the jacket L is too large in the armpits, I could not choose any of them, I was not satisfied"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"It runs small, just order up",5,"Ive known this style to be tight, but I was buying it for a teenage boy who wears a 14, so it should have been big on him, it wasn’t. It was smaller than I expected and he won’t get a lot of wear from it. Just keep in mind that it tends to run small but should be snug on the arms. Guys, if you’re jacked you might not be too comfortable in this style. There isn’t any stretch to it, it isn’t meant to be, but with wear, it softens up just like a good pair of jeans."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"I like this jacket, only one issue",4,"I like everything about this jacket.  I am 5""10"" at 175 lbs.  I usually take a large long or an XL.  I got this in XL and found the sleeves about an inch short.  It is ok, I can live with that.  I then got another one in XXL and found the sleeves just right.  A little wider but I can live with that.  One is good, 2 better right?"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Good fit,5,"5'6"" 130lbs and XS fits perfectly with one layer underneath. Its a bit tight on the arms if I wear a hoodie."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,VERY high quality jean jacket,5,"This jacket is perfect, and I never want to take it off. I have no idea why the ""mugito"" color is so cheap ($45!!! -- half the price on the Levi's website), so I was worried it might be cheap feeling or thin. Nope -- this bad boy is heavy and thick and 100% cotton.I was also curious about the size - a lot of people were freaking out about it being too small, but I went with my gut and got a small, and it fits PERFECTLY, even with a sweater under. For reference, I am a slightly pear-shaped woman with leg muscle: 5' 7.5"" and between 135-150 pounds (don't weigh myself).I wouldn't size up if I were you - part of the appeal of the jacket is that it hits at the wrist and the belt line!This jacket is straight up making me look forward to fall."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,A fun bad-ass jacket!,4,"This jacket is a great jacket--no doubt. I have them in the other colors, too. This feels like a modern fit which is close to the body. It fits somewhat small on the arm pit area. The jacket does have a factory smell as well but it's not disgusting. I think extended wear will add your own body smells to it. I do wish it was made in USA and would buy that version if they made it.It goes nicely with contrasting jeans or pants. It also looks good with gloves when driving a car or motorcycle. But then again, my style rules are not your rules.Hope this helps! If you buy it, enjoy it!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Find your fit!,5,"As recommended, I visited a Levi's outlet store to test out different sizes. I should have been an XL because of my 45in chest and 38in waist, maybe an L but I actually fit perfectly in an M.  After the shock of that wore off, I ordered this green one online in an M and it fits exactly the same. Apart from the wacky sizes, the color is fantastic."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Order Larger For Shoulders!,3,My rating is on the Brand. The shoulders are too small I am returning the 3rd jacket. Normally I wear a Large. I assumed an X-Large would solve the shoulder fit. It did not. There is no difference in the shoulder sizes! So I’m ordering a XXX-Large and hope it doesn’t swallow me or feel the same tight fit thru the shoulders. I don’t understand the problem except that U.S. sizes seem to confuse other countries! Order larger than normal guys. Love the jacket. Thankfully the return process has been swift and easy. Thanks!
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Sizing not accurate,1,"I have the same jacket in another color. It is a medium and fits me perfect. I purchased a large and it was so tight I couldn't button it. Sleeves were too skinny for my amrs. They are a little muscular, but this thing would barely go over a womans arm."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Perfectly oversized for a women,5,"I hate how women’s jean jackets are always so short in the back. I wanted a slightly oversized looked to layer under and a men’s size small worked perfectly to achieve that look. I’m 5’1 130lbs as a reference. It’s a little thinner than I thought, but good enough for Spring."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,wrong sizing of Levi jean jacket,1,"I am a size large but often wear medium.  I ordered a large and cannot fit into the jacket.  I notice that it is made in Cambodia and maybe meant for people with smaller built bodies.  I do, however, think the wrong size label was sewed in the jacket.  I would like to reorder but don't want to send it back if the sizing is wrong again. I think I need to find a store that sells the Levi jean jacket so I can try it on."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Stinks,2,"Literally smells.  The first few times I wore it, I checked the bottom of my shoe and my underpants.  Then I realized the jacket smells!  It's Chinese chemicals probably but it has an eau de poop.  Not kidding.  I washed it 3 times and was hopeful.  Nope.  Still stinks.  It's like that Seinfeld episode with the car. I'm not returning it because I really want a Levi's jean jacket, but I'm questioning my judgment"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Disappointing,2,"This is the 2nd attempt at getting this jacket. It was purchased for a 5'10"", 174 lb. male. Other reviews made it seem as though the medium would fit perfectly; however, he couldn't even get it on completely. The large looked good, but was very constricting across the shoulders and back, so it's going back as well. I guess this was made for smaller-framed individuals, but anyone with broad shoulders is just out of luck."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Great jacket, but do your research!",4,"I was hesitant to buy this after reading lots of mixed reviews. However, I went for it, and I'm glad I did. Went to the Levi's website for sizing information and decided to purchase a L (wanted it to be loose/oversized) when I normally wear a M. For reference, I'm a 5'6"" female weighing 145lbs. Jacket got here and fit as I expected it to: plenty baggy within the torso and collar, and plenty of room within the sleeves to put sweaters or other jackets underneath.As for the color and appearance of the jacket, it's pretty much as pictured. I compared it to the jacket on the Levi's website and the only difference I could find was the stitching color for the buttons (they were dark grey instead of tan). I personally didn't have any issues with tags being torn off or the red label being blank. There is a bit of a chemically smell but nothing that won't go away with time.Basically, this was a good buy for me. However, you definitely need to do your research with sizing and do run a risk of getting a jacket that has imperfections, but I think it's worth a shot. Good quality jacket, and definitely worth the research and risk of sending back if you end up with a positive experience like I did."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Bangladeshi Copies of this jacket are one size smaller than the labeling!,5,"Long story short....... The copies of this jacket ""made in China"" fit as expected...... Copies ""made in Bangladesh"" will fit one size smaller than the label.....I've bought both in the last year and have them for comparison....... XL Bangladesh fits the same as L China...... I had to return a L Bangladesh copy and re-order in XL.......... Current stock (as of 4/2017) is likely Bangladeshi...."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,It appears to be a knock-off,1,I bought a 3x but it fits like a L. The coloration is not as pictured in the ad. Not up to the quality standards you would expect from a Levi's product. There is just nothing good about it other than the price. Save your money.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"White paint splatter ""stains"" on jacket",3,"My son put this jacket on his wish list. Fits him fine and he'll keep but he did not notice in the description that the jacket comes with white paint stains on it ... intended I guess to give it a more worn, rugged guy look. He's not a fan of manufactured paint stains (kinda like buying jeans with intentional rips) since who the heck wears a jean jacket to paint??If his guy friends give him ribbing for getting a jacket with pretend paint stains, he's going to mumble something about bleach in the wash ..."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Great jacket but not fitted as expected.,4,"I saw this on Amazon and have always wanted one, and at the low price, I went ahead and ordered. The jacket looked exactly as expected but fitted a little snug around the shoulders. I ordered an 2XL since I like my jackets a little loose, but when I tried it on it did not fit as I thought it would.  I am not totally disappointed even though the jacket fitted like a XL and not a 2XL. Overall it was a good jacket and I would recommend it to my friends. Though I would tell them to order one or two sizes larger."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Runs small and tight in arms and shoulders.,2,I dont know who changed the specs for Levis classic Trucker Jacket but it doesn't compare to my 20 year old size L jean jacket. I bought an XL directly from Levis because my old one had shrunk (or I got bigger). In general it fit well with the exception of the shoulders and upper arms. It was way too tight. I sent it back and thought I would go XXL. Now I am swimming in the jacket and the shoulder and upper arms are still too tight. They run smaller than normal. They aren't as thick (heavy) a cotton as the old ones.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Good.. but not as good as it used to be,5,"Great jacket and exactly what I was expecting.  NOT the Levis jackets of the past by any means, much thinner and much lighter.... can not speak to the durability, but based on the thinness of the material, I would say it is nowhere as durable as the Levis Denim Jackets of the past.  The description says :ORIGINAL Truckers Jacket""... but unfortunately, the only thing that is original is the design and fit. They do seem to be well made overall and I would buy again, the fit is great and the colors are nice and deep.  I am happy with my purchase, if you do your homework first, you will be too."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Just right,5,So surprised. I’m 6’8 280. Normally problems with arms fitting correctly. They fit perfect for a jean jacket. At the wrist with arms down. They come back a bit with arms extended but it’s to be expected. It’s what I hoped for .
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Great quality jacket. I love the black one.,5,"Great quality jacket. Happy to see these are making a comeback. I had previously bought a blue one but decided to get black, so I can wear it with blue jeans and not have that denim tuxedo look (ha ha). The black goes with everything and looks a little dressier, in my opinion. I am 6' tall and currently about 200 lbs. I got the XL and it fit me perfectly in the chest, sleeve and waist. The fabric and stitching look high quality. I highly recommend it!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Great Jacket,5,I really like the jacket.  I went with a 1x Tall  to compensate for my 5'10 210 lbs - not that I'm tall but I a bit to round in the gut.  So the length helped. It is just about right - if I lose 10 lbs I think it will fit great.  As far as durability and looks - great jacket.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Great jacket,5,"I’m 6’ 190lbs. I’m a fairly fit guy and I’m broader than most so I’m not surprised that a medium fit a little tight in the chest and shoulders but the length is perfect.Wish it was a more thick denim, like my good fellow jacket (target), but they don’t have black so this is good enough."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,it is what it is,3,I'm medium build and ordered XX large. Because I figured when I wash it it might shrink some. I haven't washed it yet. Tight in upper arms and sleeves are just a little bit too long and kinda of short at waist line. I bought it to work in but it's way too tight for that.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Ordene una chaqueta no un zorrillo apestoso.,1,"Yo ordené una chaqueta nueva y me llego una usada y apestosa. Por que el paquete en el que estaba, estaba roto. En pocas palabras lo abian abierto antes de ponerlo en el empaque de amazon. El tamaño estaba perfecto por que me sirvió bien. Pero percate que tiene una peste asquerosa a tinte. Que se impregna hasta en la piel y hasta donde yo se todos los productos de la malca levi's no apestan y no sé despintan. Yo quiero saber por que me llego un producto así de malo. Yo pedí una chaqueta no un zorrillo apestoso."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,The big RED stripe,5,When I ordered this they had a tone in stock.  I just clicked on the correct color of denim.  What I did not see is that everyone of the jean jackets have a huge colored stripe.  The photos were taken in such a way that you do not see the 3-4 inch wide stripe a crossed the back.  My husbands stripe was bright red with a bight blue stripe in the middle of the giant red stripe.  We got lucky my husband loves it.  He got over the stripes because the fit was so good.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Cheap Material,2,"It has Levi’s insignia but not sure that product fits its company products, it cheep materials! I have many other Lev’s products and similar denim jackets but this one its not even close to Levi‘S products"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,It fits the way I wanted it to,5,"I like my clothes way big because I layer and I like to ball up in my jackets,  this jacket is awesome, warm,  and cozy.  Very well made very good to wear with the cold weather. Standing up it goes to my upper thigh,  sitting down,  or bending over it goes to my mid thigh,  so it fits the way I need it to for me,  so yea I say cool jacket for cool weather."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Yo mido 1.83 m (6'0'') y tengo un peso de 74 kilos, para un corte relajado una XL",5,"Muchas dudas tenia con el tamaño de la chaqueta, lei muchos comentarios. Finalmente pedi en talla XL, el modelo Lamar (Black). Me quedo perfecto de largo de brazos (y eso que tengo lo brazos un poco mas largos que lo normal).Yo mido 1.83 m (6'0'') y tengo un peso de 74 kilos (163 lbs). Estructura delgada como pueden calcular (y voy al gym tambien).Yo queria que la chaqueta quedar unos pocos centimetros bajo el cinturo (mucho les gusta que queda arriba del cinturo, a mi no). Lo cual con la talla XL logre exactamente lo que queria, seguramente la talla L tambien me quedaba, pero me habria quedado mas corta de mangas y mas arriba de la cintura como dije anteriormente, yo no queria eso.Lo recomiendo."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,classic,5,runs little smaller then others but that is why jacket came out fitting even better then I hoped n expected.. It fits on me just perfect like tailored made.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Made in Bangladesh,2,"I own a lg black levi trucker made in Mexico. Its a heavy denim and original Levi.This one is from Bangladesh and feels counterfeit. Ordered an XL. The buttons are not Levi brand, has a thinner material and is baggy around the waist and arms. Feels cheap.Posted a pic of the two but you can't really tell the difference by the pic.Authentic on the left, Bangladesh on the right."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Size up!,5,"I usually wear an XL in Wrangler, Carhartt and most every other jacket. I read the reviews and decided to get a 3XL in this jacket and it fit perfectly. So my advice to larger guys would be to get a much bigger size. All of Levi’s shirts and jackets run extremely small on me."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Product smaller than prior purchases,1,"I bought this for my husband for Father's day. It was the same size/brand jacket he has been wearing for years. He tried it on today, and it was too tight in the shoulders. I wanted to exchange it, but when I went into the order today, it says the return policy expired 4 days ago. I now have a coat I can't use, and he doesn't have one. I cannot afford to repurchase, I only wanted to exchange for a size bigger."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Cheap quality.,1,Worse quality and cheap stitching.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,If you are an Extra Large order a Double Extra large i.e. XXL,5,Had a similar Levi's Jacket better quality before but gave it away - after awhile started to miss having it so I ordered this one.  Love this jacket - also have a Levi's Barn jacket.  Looking for another Levi's Jacket longer with zippers like a Barn Jacket.  Thank you Amazon - also excellent price.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Ordered it a size larger, it's tight after washing",3,"So I got this in ""Boula/Unbasic Block Trucker"" and I like the way it looks.  It fit fine out of the box, roomy at size XXLT so I could layer, but it's tight after one washing.  I'd expect this much shrinkage maybe from their 501 Shrink to Fit jeans, but my last Levi's Jean Jacket didn't shrink like this."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Size runs very small,5,Too small at chest. I had ordered an XL that was too small so I gave it away. Ordered an XXL but it was almost the same size. Not sure if I’ll return it or give it to a friend  Now I have an XXXL and it fits perfectly.  Nice looking coat - great fit
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Large jacket was a little too snug for me.,5,Nice product. I am 5’7 with an athletic build and weigh 180lbs. Large jacket fits snug and was a little tight in the Bicep area of the sleeve. I re-ordered an extra large.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Way too small,1,"Unless you are as skinny as the people making these jackets it will not fit you, I bought an x large last year when all my tops and jackets were x large and I could get my arm in but not bend it and no chance of closing, so this year hoping last year was a fluke I bought a xxlarge when all my other tops and jackets are still x large and still way too tight on arm and could not close jacket, I don’t even have big arms just a gut. I will never buy anything from Levi’s ever again"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,levi jacket,5,"Very nice jacket. I have been trying to find one of these in my size for several years at many different retailers and it has always been sold out. Finally found one here on Amazon. My size is 3XL Tall, but I ordered a 4XL Tall as I like my jackets loose. The fit was exactly what I wanted."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Nice jacket, funny smell",3,I usually wear an XL but I found that XXL fit me the best for this jacket. The quality is good and it’s comfortable. My only complaint is that it smells… strong. Even after an initial washing. I’m hoping the smell fades as I wear it.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,but the sleeves were excellent length. So,3,"In the ""XL"" size (which is what I usually wear) the jacket was too snug across the front, but the sleeves were excellent length. So, I ordered the XXL and find that the sleeves are about one fold too long, but the middle fits well and I am able to fit a light sweater underneath. I will have a tailor adjust the sleeve length.  The last Levi jacket I had lasted me over 20 years and still looked OK when my son ""requisitioned it"" from me."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Nice jacket, but watch out for the ""Corporate"" color",4,"The jacket definitely runs a little slim, but it's actually not too bad.  I think it's just a cut big guys like me aren't used to.  I surely would have kept this jacket, but I sent it back.  I had ordered the color ""corporate"" - which appeared in the picture to be a lightly washed black. BUT it has these fairly goofy velcro patches on it.  As if there to attach my Levi's badges and stuff to.  Maybe some people find this cool....."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Check the size well,5,We are all built differently.  So the sizing chart isn’t the greatest at figuring out the size.  This came way to big for me.  However the jacket was just as described and looked great.I did send back for a refund.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Nice product,5,"Color was as advertised, size runs true to fit to slightly smaller so if you intend to wear sweaters or hoodies underneath, you might want to size up as you might not be able to button up with heavier garments underneath. I like this classic look\fit jacket and have had several compliments already. If you shop around you’ll find the used or vintage shops are only a few buck less so, I recommend this New one especially if you desire the darker colors like rinse or black."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Good jacket, definitely true to size.",4,"I’ll start by saying that I do like the jacket. Quality is great, color is great. I just personally underestimated Levi sizing. I’ve been to the Levi store and usually when I try on an xxl tall, it just fits. So I ordered the 2xlt and I gotta say, it’s plenty big. Just slightly oversized but I don’t mind, good for layering in the fall. I was however looking for a different fit so I’ll probably try the xtl anyway, overall good jacket but stay true to size, I’m a tall guy with broad shoulders and I wouldn’t recommend sizing up."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Quality, value and delivery cannot be topped!",5,"I first purchased this item at a high end department store. It ran a bit small, so did not fit my husband. Using the tag information, I turned to the Internet to find it in a larger size. I found it on Amazon (for a better price, plus I could use reward points for this transaction). I ordered it on a Saturday, and it arrived ON SUNDAY. The ""gravy"" on this purchase is that it was a perfect fit.I could not be happier with the product, the price, or the PRIME delivery service."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Jacket is fine, sleeves are tight",3,"I gave this to my husband as a gift, so it was a while before he would try it on.  But the jacket is fine in fit, but the sleeves are too tight.  He isn't oversized in sleeves in anything else, it is just the cut of this jacket."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,WAY TOO SMALL!,2,"I purchased the 2XL.  It was the biggest size before the 6XL.  I usually purchase either XL or 2XL in jackets and coats since I have fairly long arms. But this jacket runs VERY Small.  The sleeves are far too short (for me at least).  For the record, I'm 6'1"" at around 225 lbs."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Lovely jacket,5,"I ordered this in an XXL because of all the reviews saying how small it was. I am 6’2, 230lb lady. The body is really big on me but the arms are the correct length. I don’t mind it being so big because I can wear sweaters and things underneath and there’s more room for patches on the outside. The jacket is great quality and I love it!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"Solid fit, better stretch than expected",5,Good stretch in the material. First I got an XL and after trying it went down to a large. Fits snug in the shoulders and has a nice fit all around. Haven't worn it in anything less than 60° yet and it's been great.I wear a 46 chest and a 34 Jean and it looks fitted and compliments an athletic build with a large.
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Bought 1 size larger and no complaints,5,"Its not a thick thick jacket butt it still a good one. Still warm, good to wear over a sweatshirt. I bought 1 size larger just incase. Fits a little bit big, not by much tho. Good quality denim for sure, nice and flexible material. Good deep pockets as well"
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,This is my absolute favorite jacket ever!!!,5,"I bought this jacket for a trip to Wisconsin, and had read both good and bad reviews... but once I received it, I knew I'd made a good decision. It is so incredibly comfortable and well-balanced. It just feels good to wear and kept me comfortable whether I was in 25 degree snow-blown craziness or a 60 degree mild morning. I love all of the pockets. The zippers function well. There are ventilation options on this thing that I haven't gotten to use yet, but I'm sure they will prove to be inline with the quality I've experienced so far.If you're traveling and are looking to take just one jacket to keep you warm and dry in variety of climates, this is the one. I'm very happy with my purchase."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,"Quality built, very warm/water proof performance ski jacket.",5,"This jacket checks all the boxes for a high performance insulated ski jacket. It is now my go to jacket for in bounds/resort skiing. I have now tested it in wet snow and Very cold (-8 F) conditions and was completely dry and comfortable. The well sealed seams, quality zippers and powder skirt inside around the waist all work extremely well to keep the wind and snow out. It is also soft, flexible and light weight which makes it very comfortable for all day skiing and chair lift riding. The ""Life Pocket"" really did seam to preserve my phone battery life on cold days while running a resort app with GPS to track my ski stats. Best insulated jacket I have ever skied with in 45 years of gear testing. Bonus: My partner says it looks very good also. Should have bought it sooner."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,"Great jacket, came with loose stitches",5,"Update: I emailed Helly Hansen support and they quickly replaced the coat. The entire turn-around was just a few days.The coat itself is great. I'm 6'1, 200lbs with an athletic build and the Large fits great. The forearms are a little snug, but still fit a mid layer sweater just fine. Will update again after using on the mountain this weekend. Really pleased so far.I would have given 5 stars, but (per the pictures) the stitching under the chest pockets was loose when the jacket arrived.Really doesn't bode well for the longevity of the jacket."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Great skier's jacket,5,"This is the replacement of my old NorthFace.  My NorthFace has held up well but there's a ton of new niceities with this new HH jacket.  Pockets for the lift pass, phone, wallet, goggles, gloves.  Detachable hood, powder skirt and I don't know what to call those sleeve things.  It's not super warm but I suppose it's made for layers.  Seems to be true to size.  Happy with seller & with product."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,"Solid Jacket, Solid Fit, Solid Price!",5,"I haven’t put this jacket through its paces yet, but I don’t think I’ve ever had an insulated ski jacket that fit this good without restricting my motion.  This jacket is described as trim cut vs. the relaxed/baggy fit of some of its siblings.  At 5’ 11”/220lbs, I typically have to go a size up, but not here as the XL fit me perfectly.  Not too baggy or bulky despite the Primaloft insulation. I wear a 17.5 34/35 in men’s shirts and the jacket and sleeve length were also spot on.Hard to beat the price either!"
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Runs small,5,"I returned the size medium yellow Alpha 3 and bought a blue large Alpha 3. I am 5'8"" and weigh 172 lbs. I tend to keep my ski gear forever and a day and I don't see why the HH Alpha 3 won't last that long. The jacket is warm when it's cold outside and not overly warm during spring skiing."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Amazing jacket!,5,"Excellent jacket! This jacket is as good as it gets. Warm, comfortable, and allows for excellent movement. Don’t get me wrong, it is a bit pricey but it’s a great jacket and made extremely well."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,"Good everyday, good Ski, but thin",4,"Be prepared to layer under this coat.  My old HH was 10 times warmer, so I was a little letdown."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,I absolutely love the hood,5,"I was skeptical giving that I live in Minnesota, but this is a warm jacket. I absolutely love the hood, multiple zipper utility pockets, and the style. My wife really likes the look."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Amazing Jacket,5,"I finally did it and bought a nice jacket for myself. It worked great and isn't bulky. I skied in a snow storm that was below zero, and it worked great. I stayed warm the whole time. Then also on the nicer days it breaths nicely. Highly recommend this jacket."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,"Warm, functional and well made",5,"This coat fits as expected....if you're a large in other coats, you're a large in this one.  It's very warm and completely blocks the wind.  Pockets are all in the perfect spots...very functional.  Don't think you can ask more from a coat than this..."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Comfortable and warm,5,Wore this jacket during a week of skiing - never once got cold or over heated. Perfectly ventilated and warm. One base layer worn underneath. It's expensive but worth every penny.
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Great Ski Jacket,5,Exactly what I was looking for and it proved to be high quality
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,comfortable fit,5,will have to wait another month before I put it through the real “test” when I hit the slopes...thankfully CO is get’n snow early this year; hopefully that’s a good sign for a long season...will update my review mid ski-season
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,As advertised,4,"Fit's per size chart on HH website. All the pockets are nice.Collar is a little stiff because of the way the removable hood velcr's in, but I expect it to soften with wear."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Great jacket,5,Warm. Fits a little snug. Looks good
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Snowboard jacket - tight in places and warms up when you are exercising,4,Nice jacket.  Snowboard jacket so it is a bit tight and not as warm as I expected unless you are moving around.  Great quality
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Great Coat!,5,Purchased this for my husband and he loves it!
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Superwarm,5,Great Jacket. It borders on too warm but has great vents.
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Great quality,5,"Great jacket!  Has an athletic cut- Very light, but doesn’t sacrifice warmth.  I’ve been in 10 degree temps with just a long sleeve tshirt underneath and had to open the vents."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Really pleased with this jacket - breathes so well but keeps ...,5,Really pleased with this jacket - breathes so well but keeps me warm - wish I'd bought jacket like this years ago.
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Better than expected perfect,5,Fit perfect and took it skiing and performed like a champ love the ram vents
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Five Stars,5,Great jacket - Too bad about my muffin top though!
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,great jacket. arrived on time and as advertised,5,great jacket.  arrived on time and as advertised.  recommend seller and jacket.
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Great coat!  But the zipper is on the left...,5,"I wanted a ski coat that didn't feel like I was wearing a tent, and this is the one.  It's warm, it fits snug enough not to cause drag or rubbing during skiing, but still has room for layers underneath as needed.  I also like that it sits about 5 inches below my belt line, rather than down to my thighs, which I hate since coats that do that restrict leg movement.  On top of everything else, it looks great too - mine's green.I wore this with a patagonia 1/4 zip sweater underneath and was warm even during single digit weather.  It cuts wind great even at speed going downhill - no chill whatsoever, but it also doesn't really overheat when the sun comes out either.  Super comfortable, well made coat.My only gripe is that the zipper is on the left, purely due to the familiar function.  My brain is used to reaching to the right side for the pull.  Not sure why anyone makes a men's jacket with the zipper on the other side, but apparently it happens with European brands seemingly at random."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Not durable enough to withstand normal skiing,1,"The jacket fits well and is very warm. I bought this, despite it being expensive, thinking it would be a jacket I wore for a few ski seasons. I was very disappointed that on my first ski trip two weeks after buying the jacket, on the second day of skiing, I found a significant tear in the fabric. I contacted HH customer service thinking there might be some kind of warranty since I only owned the coat for 2 weeks when the incident happened. I was told that they would not cover this and that I could have the product sewn and repaired at my own expense. This product is not durable enough to handle the normal wear and tear of a weekend of skiing and given how expensive it is, I would not recommend."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Great Jacket,4,"I just received the jacket today and I was too worry of the color I have chosen, however, I do like it.  But I have one concern, it's very pricey and I have seen it in other website there huge difference in compare to Amazon posted price.  I hope there should be a review in the pricing or at least do matching pricing."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,"Warm, snug, but won't last",1,"Warm jacket, lots of features and pockets, but didn't last through its first week of the new season.  A good jacket if you can afford to replace it often, and don't ever intend to ski anything except groomed runs at the resort."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Feel,5,"What a great jacket. Warm, without feeling heavy. Fit is spot on. Cant wait to be able to wear during the winter months"
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,,0,Functional - does all it should. Only loses a star because when it gets wet it crinkles up a bit around the zippers... looks weird. Not returned as once it dries it goes back to normal however being a 'ski' jacket that will often have wet snow or rain on it - not ideal.
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,,0,"This jacket is light and non-bulky yet warm and functional. The details spell quality. I’ve yet to try on the slopes but it looks great and athletic and doesn’t restrict movement. It certainly keeps out the rain and wind but seems breathable (though this I haven’t really tested yet). I bought the jacket in Alert Red, which is rather more ‘orangy’ in tone than the bluer and darker reds that I generally prefer, but it’s a striking colour and certainly aids visibility."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,,0,"This product is absolutely perfect and I'm delighted with the quality and workmanship gone into its manufacture. It's just a pity that the price dropped £30 after I purchased it."" Brilliant Coat."""
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,,0,"Be warned this is O-R-A-N-G-E jacket! Not even close to colour of photos!Even it is soft, light, look good.. colour is deal breaker!Unless you want to stand from others like Road Worker, better choose another colour!"

Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,,0,"I tried it in Lapland when skiing during -21C and was perfect. The zippers could be better quality and need the ability to keep the hood on when windy. Apart from that, it's a great buy."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,,0,It is a good jacket but I received last year's model - the colours are slightly different however the features are the same. They should specify that it is the 2017 model

Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,,0,"Compramos esta chaqueta para un cumpleaños, porque el descuento lo hacía irresistible. Casi un 50% menos en una chaqueta de esta calidad. Además al cumpleañeros le gustaba esquiar así que genial.La calidad como siempre, cuando hablamos de Helly Hansen, impresionante. Todos los detalles, las costuras, el acabado de sobresaliente. Y también destacar la ligereza de la prenda, para el abrigo que da, sorprende.En cuanto al tallaje, quizás hace un poco de menos. En nuestro caso cogimos una L que luego tuvimos que cambiar a M porque era un poco grande (el cumpleañero usa prendas  entre tallaM y talla L).Genial producto, con un precio espectacular y todos contentos"
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,,0,"NO vale, el precio oficial: 450 Euros, Yo NO pagaria, Ni 200 euros, por ella, de hecho (desde mi punto de vista) Ninguna chaqueta, que NO sea GORE-TEX, vale mas de 300 Euros, por mucho precio, que le quieran poner, quitando los plumas y que tengan algo especial. Esta chaqueta en particular, Ni el tejido parece, muy impermeable, Ni el relleno, es especialmente caliente. Por debajo de los 200 Euros, una buena adquisición"

Muy agradable al tacto y ligera. Usaba una chaqueta Volkl desde hacía veinte años de gran calidad y quería renovar. Me decanté por esta opción y estoy muy satisfecho. Nada que envidiar a otras marcas. Bien de talla (L correcta para 1.80 y 73 kilos). Mangas largas que yo agradezco porque tengo los brazos largos pero que conviene tener en cuenta. Capucha muy practica porque permite cubrirse con casco. Cuello más bien amplio que resulta cómodo pero que puede resultar demasiado “ventilado” por lo que yo lo completo con una braga. No es una chaqueta ceñida pero queda muy bien ¡Gran compra!"
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,,0,Calidad Helly Hansen. La chaqueta la recomiendo para quien le guste llevar la ropa de nieve un poco más pegada y ceñida ya que se adapta a la perfección.

Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,This jacket is not waterproof,1,"I bought this jacket because it was advertised as waterproof. I specifically did not buy one that was ""water resistant."" I wore this for a hike for the first time today and as you can see from the picture, it is not waterproof.I came back soaked from the hike. I wish I could give this product a zero because it does not work as advertised. DO NOT BUY this if you will be in the rain for any prolonged period of time."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,but its basically been like this since the first time I wore it in ...,1,"I've had this jacket for a while, a bit over a year now, and this is definitely not a rain jacket. The jacket is waterproof only for very short periods of time. If I wear it in heavy rain walking from my car into my office building, by the time I get to my desk, a less than 2 minute trip total, water is already starting so soak through and the inside of the back of the jacket is starting to get damp. Unfortunately I discovered this well after the return window, but its basically been like this since the first time I wore it in rain, about 2 months after purchase.Now, it never gets particularly soaked, but some water definitely permeates the jacket, and does so pretty quickly. Just to make sure it wasn't sweat and body humidity accumulating inside the jacket, I hung it on a chair, sprayed it down with a hose in the middle of the back, where there are no seams. After spraying I checked the inside was still dry, and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Coming back, it was damp inside. Putting the jacket on, it was damp enough I could feel the wetness on my back through the wicking polo shirt I had on almost immediately, but  not so wet that my shirt looked wet when I took it off.Despite being somewhat water permeable, it isn't very breathable.Wearing this jacket in pre-storm weather on a warm summer day will very quickly result in a lot of sweat accumulating inside the jacket.This  jacket is really more of a ""water resistant, non breathable windbreaker"" than anything else. Not impressed. I prefer my windbreakers to be much more breathable than this. I prefer my raincoats to be waterproof enough to stand in the rain for a half hour without getting wet. This jacket doesn't fit either.Perhaps I got a bad one, as there are some reviews like mine, and others claiming it is waterproof. Maybe some waterproof coating gets sprayed on at the factory and they forgot mine. Whatever the case, this isn't really a raincoat."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Excellent Fit, Great Price",4,"This jacket does exactly what it's supposed to do: packs small and keeps me dry when I need it. The fit is great (runs a bit big, so I ordered one size down), and the price can't be beat. It really inspired me to vote Donald Trump out in November."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Unlined sleeves: it does matter,3,"This came quick, fits as expected and repels water just as advertised.And while I knew this ahead of time, I had no idea why this little fact was important until I wore it a few times: the sleeves aren't lined.I live on the central Oregon coast. It is mostly wet all the time. Thus, you tend to make your decisions when you head outside based on whether you care you are getting wet or not. If you care, you put on your big, ol' coat and head out. If you don't, then just head out sans coat and get wet.As I get older, the less I enjoy the ""I'll just get wet"" option. So I got this thinking it would serve well in the scenarios where I ordinarily would just suffer getting wet. This was small and light and would be a quick way to stay dry without overheating.Except that the sleeves aren't lined.So, if it is a fairly nice day, but raining as usual, and you toss this over your short sleeves and head to the garage, by the time you get there, it will be stuck to your arms like a wetsuit. This isn't because of the outside rain. This is due to the trapped moisture *inside* the coat. Thus, the second the moisture impervious material comes in contact with your arms, it sticks to them. Which is not a nice feeling. In fact, the feeling is pretty much exactly ""I can't wait to get this thing off me.""So, it is useless on days where the temperature says short sleeves but the clouds say rain.I will keep it as in colder temperatures, it is easier than dealing with a heavy coat for quick outdoor adventures.But it isn't functional in the ways I had hoped."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Should be called a windbreaker NOT a rain jacket,1,"We just received this item last week and my husband had a chance to use it this past weekend when we were in the mountains. It rained off and on quite a bit and during the first time it rained, which was NOT a downpour just regular light rain, it soaked through the jacket material and onto his shirt leaving wet spots. So, Columbia's name for this jacket is definitely a bit of a stretch."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,All-in-all a good rain jacket to use for years to come,5,"Bought this rain jacket for my teenage son. Part of me wanted the rain jacket I bought for him to have more substance to it, but that's not the point of a spring rain jacket. This has no soft lining because it's not supposed to. We live in Virginia where you typically (not this year!) have only a handful of days that are spring warm/hot but significantly raining. So even your lightweight winter hooded jacket is too warm for the weather but a non-rain resistant spring jacket won't do either. We hate having to carry umbrellas, so this lightweight, hooded rain jacket does the trick. I bought Columbia thinking that he can own it for years to come since he's done with all of his major growth spurts & our area typically doesn't have enough of these days to justify buying a new one every year for a growing kid. It's also very squishable/packable, so it's the kind of thing that I would recommend he throw into every duffle/suitcase he packs for trips as a ""just in case"" kind of thing that takes up so little room & adds so little weight to your luggage that you're grateful if you need it & you don't really mind that you brought it even if you didn't end up needing it."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Sauna Jacket,1,"While this jacket has some mesh lining, it is only on the front portions near the zipper. The rest of the inside is open to the inside liner that acts as more of a sauna than anything else. The inside of the sleeves stick to my arms at the first sign of perspiration and that is with wearing the jacket in cool temperatures (in the 40 to 50 degree range Fahrenheit) . The jacket uses Velcro patches to secure away the rain hood and uses the same means to secure an inside pouch that it touts one is able to use to store the jacket in on itself. I am weary of using the Velcro patches as the ones around the hood already show some strain in the stitches used to secure them. This is the second jacket that I ordered that used the Velcro means to secure the hood - I returned the first as the Velcro patches on it already had the stitching pulling out completely."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Fits great and keeps you dry!,5,"First off gotta say I love this. Very happy I got it! There’s some things I wish were different and I’ll get into that but overall I think it’s a solid buy.Size: So I’m 6’4” and about 340lbs. The sizing was confusing when buying so I kept looking on other reviews etc to guess. Almost bought a 3Xl but I’m glad I went with the 4Xl instead. A little big but not unflattering. In fact it felt better and more breathable that way. So if you’re a big guy there’s big sizes for you!Design pros: Bought for deep sea fishing but honestly, I think I’d rock this even as a rainy day jacket! It’s got a nice style! Cons: lack of lining inside the sleeves can make it feel a bit clammy if you have nothing under and it’s resting just on your skin. Also, the straps at the wrists only help make it smaller not bigger as I was assuming so it’s not something you can role up your sleeves with.Pockets are a bit underwhelming as they’re made of a very flimsy feeling mesh(may not actually be flimsy) but I did not feel safe having anything important in my pockets.All that being said? I would still really Recommend this especially for bigger guys as our options are limited!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,A solid rain/wind jacket,4,Jackets either work or they don't.  I needed a rain jacket and picked this one because it looked like the hood would cover my head well.  It didn't disappoint and does a good job in rain.  What I didn't see coming was being able to swing a golf club with it on.  It's been cold and windy in the bay area lately so a hoodie is required.  I don't usually wear a hoodie type jacket when I golf as they're usually uncomfortable and make it hard to swing.  This one worked really well.  A good buy.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Toasty jacket that punches way above its weight class.,4,"For the price, you aren't likely to find a better packable rain jacket than this. From the snazzy color scheme and design to the light weight, to the stowable hood and roomy pockets, this jacket punches way above its weight class. The jacket packs down easily into a pouch about the size of a softball, and can therefore be taken just about anywhere without being cumbersome. Once you've got it unpacked, you'll be able to cinch the wrists to your comfort level, and with the zipper zipped and hood up, you'll stay dry as well as toasty. That leads me to one of the jacket's only issues. Due to the water-resistant nature of the materials, the jacket doesn't breathe very well. A couple of underarm vents would have made a huge difference in the comfort level of this jacket. However, as long as you're not trying to stay dry in the tropics, it really isn't enough to be a deal breaker. No, this jacket isn't going to stop you getting wet in a hurricane, but it's great for mild to moderate rain, and at less than $40.00, it's well worth having."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Best rain jacket for outdoors work!,4,"I don't usually do reviews, but I have to for this jacket! I needed a good rain jacket for work, I'm a delivery driver, so I work in all weather, and was tired of being soaked to the bone. I tried another rain jacket, but it was too big, and within 20 minutes I was burning up and sweating. This jacket does exactly what it says it will. It isn't cheap plastic material, it's very thin so it breathes, but it actually is 100% waterproof. I wore this for around 6 hours in a constant rain, and not 1 drop of water soaked through. I took it off expecting to see some condensation, but none was there, completely dry. It's easy to pack it into its pouch and throw it into a backpack, it doesn't get heavy and hold water, so it dries relatively quick. With all of the physical requirements of my job, this jacket has proven to be very durable. I do a lot of heavy lifting, climbing, twisting, turning, and bending, and that puts a lot of stress on this thin little jacket. At points I'll be lifting things that really pull the arms and chest of this jacket pretty tight, but no tears in the material or seams at all, not even a scratch! This is a very tough, durable jacket! The only issue I have is that the hood is pretty big and sticks out over your face like a bill on a hat. It wouldn't be an issue if you weren't on the move constantly and had it blocking your vision, it does keep water off your face, but creates other issues. You can pull the strings to tighten it up, but too tight and itll overlap your forehead and eyes lol. I flip the excess back which is an option thankfully, and find a good medium tightness which worked for the hood. The only other issue is the pouch that it folds into needs to be a little bigger. It does fit, but you really have to cram it in there and it takes a while to really get it to shut. 2 minor issues for a rather awesome product. I highly recommend!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Nice coat but sizing is off,4,"This seemed like a really nice coat - waterproof, lightweight, wind friendly, nice color, etc but after trying it on you could just tell the sizing wasn’t quite right. My husband likes. Little extra room in jackets so I ordered the normal size I would to account for that. He was swimming in it width wise and it wasn’t really long enough. He has other Columbia coats in this size and none of them are this wide. The length is comparable so I think the proportion issue.We return very few items as we carefully plan out our purchases and we returned this one so that should tell you a lot.If you found this useful, make sure to click helpful/yes so others like you see this."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"No, Virginia, it is not waterproof.",2,"I was prepared to contradict the reviewers who said this item was not waterproof. After all, it’s Columbia, right?  And everyone knows that some vinyl items make you sweat, so those reviewers are probably just wrong, right?I tested the jacket in the sink before my trip.  Put my arm under the faucet for thirty seconds, and my shirt sleeve was dry.  I smugly packed it up.  I even drafted a review for Amazon.  Then I took it on our annual vacation to Orlando, where everyone knows it rains in the afternoon.Well, on one day, it poured all day.  My wife and I don’t mind a little rain; it makes the lines for the rides shorter at Disney World.  I threw on the Columbia, satisfied that I would be fine and proving all those people wrong.After about thirty minutes in the open, my shoulders were starting to feel soggy.  Fine, I thought, it’s just condensation.  After an hour, I was pretty much skin-tight soaked.  Not my usual experience with a non-breathing vinyl coat; even if you sweat up a storm, those things keep you dry somewhere....not so with this product. I was wet through from head to waist. If I had been in a colder state, I could have been a good candidate for hypothermia.So, take it from a smug know-it-all, this jacket is not waterproof. I’m keeping it around as a spare (dry-weather) windbreaker for walks and quick trips to the store. But as a primary rain coat?  Nope."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Didn't really keep me dry even after two tries.,2,"I'm not convinced that this is a waterproof jacket.  I wore it while camping and it poured outside for a week.  It wasn't too hot nor cold.  I wasn't doing anything strenuous.  I turned the jacket inside out, wiped off the wet arms, and let it thoroughly dry.  I tried it again the next day and it had that moist wetness like you were sweating but not when I put it on initially.  Maybe I'm confused by what a waterproof jacket should be.  Maybe this is like waterproof hikers that are only waterproof for twenty minutes.Did I send it back?  Nope.  It's still Columbia and it looks cool.  It's more of a jacket for fall when it's 50 and not raining."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Perfect Warm Weather Jacket,4,"Super nice! Great quality materials.  I had read about some not being authentic Columbia Jackets with stamped on Columbia name.  Mine was Authentic sewn on.  The only thing I am not thrilled with is the inside of the sleeves are not lined with the webbing the rest of the jacket has.  If you have short sleeves on, the inside of the sleeves stick to your arms.  Other then that it is a great jacket.  I love the stow away hood in the collar as well."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,like stranded dolphins from drying out,1,"I wore this during the 2018 Boston Marathon which to say was wet is a bit of an understatement. I left the start line and was immediately confronted with a torrential downpour  of freezing rain. I was instantaneously soaked through and through. I think that this jacket may actually attract moisture and could be used as a device to keep marine life, like stranded dolphins from drying out."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Buy a size down!,5,"I wear a xxl Marmot because of my girth at 5'7"". These fit similarly at xl if that says something, they run big.These are excellent at waterproofing but just like the matching rain pants they don't breath all that well. Don't do anything too strenuous or they turn into sauna bags. Could be a good thing or bad.For the price, they're excellent. I needed an extra rain jacket to keep in the car in case the weather calls for 50% PNW rain (more like 80-90% chance at that rate it seems). Something that works well but doesn't replace my nicer one."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Just buy it !,5,"I bought this for my husband as a gift to take on our trip to Disney world ( the weather is always so unpredictable there !) and he absolutely loved it ! It never rained not once , but he still wore it every day of our trip there. And it wasn’t always the warmest there either. But this jacket kept him nice and warm as he wore it all day long all through out the parks. It’s a good jacket made out of amazing material. If you are on the market for a rain jacket look no further. Seriously. Just stop and buy this jacket. It is a little pricey. But you get what you pay for. And I promise you won’t be disappointed if you buy this one ! My husband loves it so much that we ended up having to buy him another one once we got home from our trip because his first one we bought got stollen out of the stroller while we was in Disney."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,This jacket is terrible...really,1,"I rarely give 1-star reviews.  Few products are completely devoid of value.This one is.This jacket is lined with a plastic/rubber of some sort that pretty much amounts to wrapping yourself in plastic wrap.I wore this for 10 minutes to a supermarket and 10 minutes back in 40(ish) weather and I was *soaked* in sweat and condensation.That is not hyperbole.  My shirt was, literally, wet on the back and sleeves.  Not damp.  Soaked as though I walked through a shower.  Whether condensation or sweat is hard to tell, probably a bit of both.  Whatever it was I was wet...wet, wet, wet, wet.  Pulling my arm out of the sleeve drew it through more wetness.  It is gross..disgusting and all around wrong.Wrapping yourself in SaranWarp will result in a similar experience.  I am shocked at how awful this jacket is.  Returning it ASAP."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Does the job really well, except in one place",3,"This is a great jacket, it is completely waterproof and doesnt let even a drop of water get inside. Its so watertight that you will start sweating inside if you completely seal off the jacket. But one part that I dont like is that where the Columbia logo is stitched into the jacket, the stitches pierce through the waterproofing layer and the water leaks in from there. I was wearing this in jacket in the rain and I got wet inside the jacket right where the logo is stitched in."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Tested, failed.",1,"Had to redo this review after wearing the jacket a few times.Simply put, the jacket needs to be re advertised as a weight loss device.The heat builds up very quickly in this thing and sweat builds up in such copious amounts that my underwear - yes my underwear was soaked.I'll put it away for z-day or maybe for visiting distant asteroids, but otherwise, no can wear."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Packable, not fashionable",4,"I tried 4 different windbreakers in search of a light jacket to wear on a Mediterranean trip that would be suitable for both the city and country in September. This fit OK - but still pretty much like a sack. It's light weight enough and would've worked well in cooler evenings (60's) with sweater under. I have several Columbia pieces and find the technology behind their clothing offers durability, weather resistance, and breathability. Zippers seem sturdy on this design, and I love the hideable Hood, as it was difficult to find water resistant windbreakers with this feature. I did not like the lack of inside pockets or the extremely plain styling and lack of shape and in the end returned this  and spendt more for the Columbia Dr downpour II, which is more stylish and I feel that I can get more use out of."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,It’s a rain jacket!,5,"I stay cool and dry when I wear my Columbia rain jacket. Protects me from the evil rain that tries to get me wet. Jacket is of thin material. Definitely made so it’s able to fit over a heavier jacket. Jacket runs large. I bought a medium, and while I can adjust the cuffs well, it still is pretty big. My advice would be potentially to buy a size down. But if you buy your normal size you can definitely utilize this jacket as a throw over to a heavier coat."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great Jacket to Replace my Original Watertight I,5,"For many years now, I've been wanting/needing to replace my original Columbia Watertight jacket. What stopped me is that they quit making the original Watertight jacket and it seemed that the replacement jacket (Watertight II) was just too different for my liking. Well I finally gave in and found out for sure, through a series of trial and error purchases, that my original Columbia Watertight jacket was better matched not with the Columbia Watertight II, but rather with this Glennaker Lake jacket! I will have to admit however, that this jacket is not a ""direct"" replacement, but it is a much much better match than the Watertight II (who woulda thunk!?!?!)! So the main differences that I noticed between them is that this Glennaker Lake jacket has Velcro to hold the hood rolled up in place rather than the zipper used my original Watertight. Also, the chest pocket is not only located inside the front zip-up enclosure (you have to partially unzip the the jacket in order to access the chest pocket), but it too is held closed by Velcro, unlike my original jacket that had the chest pocket outside the front zip-up enclosure (jacket could remain fully zipped up and still offer access to the chest pocket), with a zipper for the pocket itself. Oh, and the Glennaker's sleeves have Velcro at the ends rather than an elastic band. Even with these subtle differences, I feel that the jacket itself is a pretty close match to my original. The material is light-weight but is still waterproof and windproof so that it actually provides warmth when it's cold. The other stuff (Velcro, chest pocket, etc...), I'm sure I will eventually get used to as time goes by. All in all, this is a genuine authentic Columbia jacket with the embroidered Columbia name sewn into the material."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,A great warm weather rain coat,5,"This is a great product to be used during warm weather rain showers.  The fit is good.  The jacket rolls up easily into a self contained pouch that easily fits into a golf bag.  Speaking of golf, there is plenty of room to freely swing a club.  I look forward to a lot of use."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Rapid shipment, Nice color, Decent fit",3,"I just wanted a light,  minimally rain resistant windbreaker. It was light. I can see where it might be too little (and a bit uncomfortable) when the weather gets a tad too hot or cold. The color descriptions were accurate and it looks nice enough. Although most of the other reviewers claimed that this line of jackets was cut large, I did NOT find that to be so (it was more true to size rather than too large): I am 5'10"" 225 lbs and I usually get XL just to give myself enough room. I ordered L and and I felt that just a bit more room would have been better. The sleeves, pockets & overall length are nice, but the front zipper was cheap and it came apart when subjected to the stress of my bending over to tie my shoes. I know I need to lose 10-15 lbs so as not to stress the jacket but the zipper should not open up. If you are of slim to medium build, this jacket should be ok for you, but if you have a ""dad"" body like myself, you should be aware that ordering to exact size may be tighter at the waist region."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Looks To Be An Excellent, Light (Hopefully) Waterproof Jacket For The Big/Tall Guys!",5,"OK, after a lot, and I mean A LOT, of hemming, hawing, asking questions (thanks again JT, whoever you are), adding it to my cart, deleting it from my cart and finally re-adding it to my cart, I finally just bucked up and bought the dang thing. I got the light green one as opposed to the blue and orange one I’d originally been perusing, in the 3XT. The size chart was actually helpful and though the 2XT might actually be a more snug fit, I’m gonna keep this one. It’s never a bad idea to have a light windbreaker type jacket and I do like my clothes bigger even when I’m a smaller version of a big guy, but I really purchased this for a trip next month to Costa Rica so I don’t get totally drenched in the rainforests. But I definitely wanted it light as it will be hot. Anyway, it’s plenty long so it won’t ride up (I’m 6’4”), pretty well below the belt (in a good way) though I’d be thrilled if it was just a tad longer. But it’ll work. The sleeves are a bit too long, maybe a 38/39 if it was compared to a dress shirt and I’m more of a 37/38 kinda guy. Not a deal breaker, and I’m not sure if they can be shortened but perhaps wrapping the Velcro a little tighter will help. So we’ll see. The lime green color is pretty rad and unique and it will easily stuff into a backpack as for this trip, it really is a “just in case” jacket. So after all the hoopla, I’m really glad I bought it. I can’t comment on the water-proof aspect, as I’m not in CR yet and it’s probably not gonna rain in SoCal anytime soon. But others have vouched for it so I’m sure it’ll hold up fine. And if I get wet, I get wet - that’s half the fun! Do check the size chart as that helped me a lot in my decision, as did telling myself to “nut up or shut” up (as Tallahassee in “Zombieland” would say), and just send the thing back if I didn’t like it. But I do! I really do! And no one gave me anything to write this! Hope this helps. Cheers!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,The best rain jacket I've owned; be careful when washing,5,"I've been buying Columbia rain jackets for years, and I'll keep doing it! They look great and always feel light while keeping me dry in the heaviest of rain storms.I've found that these jackets run on the larger size, but that's okay in this case because typically you will be wearing it over your existing layers. The material that this jacket is made out of feels light while you wear it and doesn't add extra heat to your layers. I've worn this jacket in the spring, summer, and fall and it always feels great without making me overheat. However, in the summer the jacket can keep in humidity underneath, so often times I have to unzip it or take it off. This is especially noticeable when there is off-and-on rain and the sun hits you, you'll want to rip this off ASAP.These jackets are also great because you can roll them up into a ball and make them very compact to fit in a backpack or bicycle bag to avoid any looming rainclouds. I would always take my jacket with me if there was a chance of rain because it hardly added any bulk to carry in my bag.One negative that I've found: My old Columbia jacket from 2013 was the best, but I noticed after washing it a few times that it slowly lost its waterproofing. After about 4 years of use and periodic washes the jacket was pretty useless. Be careful with this jacket and make sure that you only spot clean or wash when needed, because overtime after washing the jacket it may lose the waterproofing and soak through.Overall these jackets are some of the best rain jackets you can buy. They are light but always keep you dry! Just make sure to follow the care instructions so they don't lose their waterproofing over time."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"This is definitely water resistant, and it will fold into a carry pouch once you know how",5,"Many reviews stated that this jacket is not waterproof or even water resistant, while many stated it was one or the other or both. I was hesitant to buy the jacket because I really wanted something that is at least water resistant, but I took a chance and bought this jacket and I'm glad I did. I've had a chance to wear it twice in significant rain storms, and both times I stayed completely dry.The other thing that drew me to this jacket is that it was pictured folded into a pouch. When I got the jacket, there was no pouch and no instructions, and at first I thought I was mistaken. Then it occurred to me, there is an inner pocket in the side, right along the zipper in the interior. I pulled that pocket inside out, then pushed the rest of the coat into that pocket. And voila, I had a coat in a pouch! This makes it a great way for me to keep this at work, easy to get out and carry and use on those unexpected rainy days."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Nice, simple rain jacket",4,"I'd been bending over backwards trying to find a simple waterproof rain jacket for my toddler (I know, you wouldn't though that would be difficult). I just needed a light jacket that was waterproof, and I'd ordered and returned several (or found out the hard way) that most were only water RESISTANT, which doesn't work for a little boy who wants to splash and stomp in the rain in the middle of summer in New Orleans.My son is 19 months old, 26lbs, 33"" tall. Ordered 2T and it's large but that's okay, he can grow into it. The tag says this jacket is WATERPROOF. I have NOT gotten the opportunity to test this yet, but it's Columbia so I have high hopes.Pockets are angled ""up"" rather than ""down"" which I assume is to keep rain out, but it is awkward for little wrists."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Semi-packable, but actually waterproof.",3,"When I got this jacket, I spent 15 minutes trying to figure out how I was supposed to pack it into itself so it would look like the picture.  Then I gave up and looked it up, to find that you CAN'T.  It packs into a MESH pocket, not a shell pocket like the one shown, and Columbia doesn't tell you this anywhere on their site, this site, or in their promo video for this jacket.If you're wondering why this matters, I suggest attaching this jacket, packed in its mesh bag, to your belt or backpack and walking through some brush.  You'll either end up picking up enough wood to start a campfire, or shredding the mesh.Given that little lie, I immediately tested its waterproof-ness, because what else might they have lied about, right?  Well, I put on a hoodie with this over it and use the sprayer on my sink at various pressures on one part of the sleeve.  I even made a little wrinkle-pocket for water to collect in.  Not a drop got onto the hoodie, and all I had to do to dry the sleeve was shake it a bit while I was wearing it.  It seems to have a hydrophobic coating, it's not just nylon.  Water beads and runs right off.Since it IS actually waterproof, not just water-resistant and I'm not going to be using it for actual backpacking, I'll keep it, but if YOU want one for backpacking, get a different one that packs into a shell pocket, not mesh.Honestly, if they hadn't lied about the packing pocket, I might have bought this anyway and given it five stars, but I can't stand lies in advertising."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,I originally bought this jacket for hiking since I started ...,5,"I originally bought this jacket for hiking since I started hiking locally about a couple months ago and I needed something in case it would rain. Unfortunately it never rained during my hikes, however today I had a Night Nation 5k run and it has been raining since last night non stop.I wore it in heavy wind and while raining for about 2 hours and it protected me from the rain the whole time!It was windy and about 45 degrees out. I wore another thin jacket underneath to keep me warm and this one to keep the water off of me and it worked perfectly! I had my wallet and my cell phone in the inside left packet and it stayed dry as well!Initially i was going to buy this jacket in a local store because it was on clearance but it was still $10 more than the price on amazon, and with 2 day prime free shipping you can't beat it!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Keeps You Dry but Captures Body Heat,2,"This lightweight jacket is NOT ideal for warm climates (i.e., 55 degrees or above) as it holds in body heat like a plastic/vinyl wrap making walking around very hot in the rain. Yes, it repels water but is simply not ""breathable."""
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Good fit, kept me dry during daily showers hiking on the Big Island.",4,"Bought a pair of these for my spouse and I last minute for a week on the Big Island. The 2XL was a great fit for me (5'11""/260lbs) - I had ordered a 3XL as I normally would do due to my wide shoulders, and it was huge on me. My only con is the color was a little more drab than the picture (no biggie), I was expecting a more vibrant ""street sign"" yellow. Was perfect for hiking on the Big Island between sea level and 6000ft with only a short sleeve or long sleeve quick dry shirt underneath."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,I'm very pleased with this jacket,5,"I bought this jacket as a shell/waterproof layer for hiking.  I ordered it to have a little extra room as it will be a top layer and it fit as expected.  In fact, I am very happy with the fit.  It is quite lightweight and packs down into it's own stuff pocket (once I found it on the inside) that can double as a small inside pocket if necessary.  During a short weekend outing I used it during a cool rainy morning outside and it performed well.  Only the front is lined, so there is a little bit of ""stick"" where my skin was in direct contact with the jacket but nothing that I didn't expect.  It performed well in the bit of rain I exposed it to, so I'm very pleased so far.  For now, this is my go-to carry along everywhere jacket."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Disappointing: Updated,1,"Item came next day.  Great fit, and it is indeed water proof.  i love that fact that it is a light rain jacket and not heavy.  would definitely purchase again.Update:  This is not waterproof, barely water resistant.  I'd say more like a wind breaker.So we had light showers in southern California yesterday, and I wore this to take the trash out and it no longer was waterproof, with only light showers and a 7 minutes of taking the trash out had soaked into my shirt.I am thinking, when I first purchased this that  I only used it briefly out side, as in walking to and from car into buildings.  Either that or somehow lost its ""waterproofing somewhere between the two three total times of wearing this."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Not water proof or even water resistance,2,"Titled as a rain jacket? Well I guess you could wear it in the rain but dont expect it to keep you dry. Just wore in a gentle rain for the first time since got it. Within minutes it was soaking wet all the way thru to my skin. I was about a mile into a hike and was miserably soaked and cold by the time I got back to my jeep. I love columbia products and have 3 more light weight jackets. Very dissappointed.  Oh and dont even ask me about how when you put something in one of the pockets it gets all tangled up in the mesh lining. I hope I am the only customer who truly wishes he had bought a Frogg jacket instead of this thing. I bought some rain reppellent on way home, hope that helps."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Very Nice and Very High Value!,5,"This fits larger than expected.  I usually take a large jacket, but with this coat the medium is the best fit unless i want to wear it over a polar fleece jacket.I had the Northface equivalent of this jacket before I lost weight and needed a smaller size.The lining definitely makes this coat more water resistant than other windbreakers, such as the Northface.  I also like the velcro adjustments at the cuffs so that the arms won't go beyond the wrists of my somewhat-shorter-than-average arms.  The tuck away hood is also much less bulky than that of the Northface equivalent and seems just as protective.Great coat and great value at half the price of the Northface equivalent."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Lightweight water proof with a hood,5,"Good light weight jacket with hood. Needed waterproof cover for trip to Hawaii(it rains everyday). Not necessary to have thick, just a cover. Small and light enough to pack in backpack and put it on when needed. Water proof also means it blocks the wind. I've used it to go bike riding / walking in the mornings as low as 34f with only a tee underneath and stay warm.Recommend? Absolutely."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Lightweight, good looking jacket.",5,"A little on the bigger size, but I imagine this is to fit over a sweater in colder weather. The material is thin, but that's the beauty of having it tuck into the side panel pocket for easy travel. There are no instructions for packing it in itself, but pretty easy to figure out how to fold it and stuff it backwards into the pocket that closes with velcro (fits in my backpack perfectly). I would suggest at least wearing a long sleeve tshirt under it to avoid it clinging to your screen if it's hot outside."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,good rain jacket for Florida,4,"I live in Central Florida and it rains here pretty much every day in the summer. I'm outside a lot for my job so I need something that's going to keep my dry and this jacket does a pretty good job of that. I like that you can adjust the wrist area to make it tighter. Same thing with the hood. External pockets are pretty decent sized - big enough to put your hands and your phone in them. There's a small internal pocket meant for phones as well. I never use it, though. I wish the hood pocket was a zipper rather than velcro because that's going to get dirty eventually and stop working (as well).It's not perfect, though. I actually owned two of these at one point and it's difficult to get the zipper started on both of them. Also, the large is a little TOO large. The large fits more like an XL and the medium fits more like a large. So I would recommend going down one size. I also notice that it's not completely 100% waterproof. I am still getting a tad wet inside. Not enough to make me want to return the jacket, but enough to notice. Hopefully I'll be using this for years to come."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Vey Comfortable,5,Great jacket that doesn’t break the bank but is very comfortable and waterproof.  I used it hiking in Glacier National Park in June.  One day on the trail was rainy and the jacket was great.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great!,5,I love the color and fit. It runs big compared to other standard large sizes but if you look at the measurements then you'll know what to expect. Thin and light enough to wear a sweater under without being too bulky. Price was just right and delivery was fast. Haven't tested it in a storm but I don't expect it to keep me dry in a storm haha sprinkle or light rain and this jacket will hold up against the elements.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,It doesn't fit like a jacket - very long unless you're over 6'2,3,"It's an okay ""jacket"" super thin so there's no warmth provided but it does keep the rain out. I'm disappointed by the lack of fit. I will be bringing it to a taylor to have it shortened - it goes down to just above mid-thigh (nothing like the model in the picture) so it doesn't fit like a jacket or I would say it doesn't fit at all. I would say if you're above average height this is a pretty nice jacket but if you're shorter than average it will look pretty sloppy and make you look unkempt.  Add tayloring to the price and it's not a good deal..."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Just right for me,5,"This jacket is perfect for my work days when it's raining! It doesn't have an inner lining for additional warmth,  which my last windbreaker had! Therefore, it keeps me dry, but doesn't cause me to overheat/sweat! I can just rely on 'my clothing' underneath for warmth!! The 'lightness' of its weight is nice. The hoodie that can be kept hidden underneath the collar fits just right as well! I like that the hand pockets have zippers; allowing keys or other objects to be placed within them w/o worry of losing them! It also has a large inner pocket on the inside of jacket that is velcroed! And the drawstring at the bottom of jacket allows me to tighten up around the waist, which keeps we warmer and dry too!!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Perfect for a trip,5,This is a fantastic light jacket.  Purchased to take on a European trip (wanted something I could pack small).  Sure enough one day it began to pour.  It was so easy to reach into my pack and pull out the little package and put on the coat.  It kept me dry.  I really like how you just stuff it into a pocket in the coat so no little bag to get lost.  Zippers work well and do not get caught when you are trying to zip the jacket up.  If your don't want the hood it folds neatly into a little pocket at the neck.  We purchased 3 of them in different colors.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Hood on the downlow and easy to store,5,"So crazy story. My husband is on a jobsite that does not allow hoods. Poor guy needed a rain jacket and quick because of course his totally awesome rain jacket has a hood. Is a rain jacket a rain jacket without a hood? I wondered if such a thing existed. Thankfully it does. Although this does indeed have a hood, it tucks up into the collar. Because of this feature, it is anti hood jobsite compliant. My husband really likes that it can be smooshed up into a little built in pocket when he doesn't need it. He says it keeps him dry in some of the downpours that we've had.. all sans hood. He is pretty happy with it."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Jacket looks pretty nice but boy does it under perform,1,"Fit was a bit large but I guess that allows for a layer or two underneath. Jacket looks pretty nice but boy does it under perform. As others have said it is not truly water proof, whatever you're wearing under it will get wet in direct rain. Also, after a few months the zipper started malfunctioning and now is 100% broken. Garbage."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Pretty much what it says it is,4,"This is plenty roomy, with extra length sleeves (which I don't need) and Velcro-cinched cuffs (which I do need and like a lot). I'd call it water resistant, but that is all I really hoped for. It packs small, stuffed inside one of the zippered pockets, so it is perfect for storing in my bicycle pannier along with rain pants. It doesn't breathe all that well, but it's not uncomfortable, and it really breaks the wind and cold when the temp drops on a long bike ride."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great packable travel all weather jacket.,5,"I had purchased a Columbia nylon rain jacket a few years ago that I wore a lot, especially on trips. It's was easy to pack and I could layer over a sweater or light insulated vest. I like this one for much the same reasons.This jacket has 2 side zipper pockets and a higher collar with hood inside. It's exactly what I was looking for to take on trips and for trips to the gym.I'm a 72 year old male who's 6 ft tall and 200 lbs and this jacket fits great by itself or layered over a sweater or light vest.My other Columbia jacket still looks good, so I expect this one will also for many years to come"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Doesn't breathe, so you're wet from the inside.",1,"After climbing a few flights of stairs at the ski lodge I noticed I was already wet before I even went outside. Though it is waterproof, it doesn't breathe. I wear a fleece jacket beneath this which helps wick away the moisture, and only in this configuration is it useable. I tried treating it with waterproof spray (designed to work with breathable by materials) to no avail. If you're already stuck with it, try to find a fleece/synthetic layer underneath, otherwise don't buy. Very disappointed in Columbia!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Lightweight packable Big Man rain jacket,4,"Well made, fits great, love the rain jacket.  It packs small into a built in pocket or you can just stuff it in the mesh pocket on the outside of your pack.  Light weight option for a big man, I got the 4X and it's great.  The hood is the only con, it's just a think nylon, and didn't seem to be water proof.  I got caught hiking in a storm and my head got soaked, the jacket didn't leak and worked great."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Waterproof and doubles as hair cutting poncho with sleeves!,4,"If you want a durable but light rain jacket this one will keep you dry on the outside, and warm on the inside.This jacket, like all raincoats , will make you sweat inside because it is truly superior waterproofing!.The hood folds up into collar when not in use and does not detach so you will never lose it.Heavy duty zipper , durable, and can even be used to wear while getting hair cut so no hair sticks to your clothes!Highly recommended!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,DOES NOT BREATHE,5,I love style of the jacket overall. A little on the big side (leaving room for layering) and nice enough for going out to dinner as well as fishing. There’s no holes so not much ventilation. It’s mostly waterproof but not enough for heavy rain all day.One of the downsides are they use Velcro around the wrists which looks cheap and is slightly uncomfortable. I’ll still give 1 star because I have no choice.These leaks people complain about aren’t leaks. It’s your sweat. May as well wear a garbage bag.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,What's not to like?,5,This jacket is definitely water proof.  I just walked the dog in the rain. The hood is nice. The sleeves have Velcro at the ends so you can make the wrist part loose  or tight. I got the black/grill which looks very nice. It' s a bit thin but I think that's fine because then you can decide what you want under it. Pockets zip closed. An extra pocket would have been nice but that's not a deal-breaker.  The price was very reasonable.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Waterproof & Functional But Can Be Too Warm in Summer,4,"The material is good and the sizing is okay. I used the first one I bought from about 2007-2014 before the zipper gave out. Obviously, from the images, the jacket is not meant to be baggy or form fitting. It is sized so that you can wear an extra layer under the coat, like a light to medium thick sweater, and not feel too constrained. It also hangs well over the waistline so that rain cannot sneak into your pants or pants pockets. That said, just wearing the jacket over regular clothes works out okay too. In short, it has just the right size of functional largeness.Inside the jacket, the lining is a grayish, rubbery feeling ""thing."" The second version of the coat is more refined than the first one I bought a long time ago. The lining took me a minute to get used to it, but it works and is what makes it waterproof. The major issue with the lining is that it presents a trade-off. The jacket in general is light and easily packable, but the lining works like insulation in the heat. So if you are in a climate like Florida, this jacket will block the rain but heat you up in the process. If you are trying to travel light, this jacket will work better in the fall or slightly cooler temperatures. That is the only issue to consider.Colorwise, I wish manufacturers made these and other activewear in single, more natural colors. 80% of what they sew up and sell uses the oddest colors possible. They do not fit in the woods, on the mountain, or in the city."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Decent jacket with a few cons.,3,"Overall it’s a decent jacket, but not as lightweight as it looks as far as breathability goes. Fit is pretty good, slightly on the large side so order down if you’re usually in between sizes.Now for the cons, the sleeves are super wide. Although, that might be on purpose. The arms and back do not have a liner so it will make you sweat in warmer weather. So the extra wide sleeves help get some air flow but it’s still not enough."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Nice lightweight rain jacket,5,"Regarding size.  I ordered an XXL. I'm 5'10"" 280lbs with a mid-life beer belly and this jacket still has room to wear a sweater or light hoodie underneath.  Size was a tough call as I am 3XL in most clothes but I know that Columbia is usually spot on or a little big.  I'm very happy with the look and feel of this jacket and can highly recommend.  It also has a mesh liner under each arm and front with just a polyester liner in the middle of the back.  The left side liner has an inside Velcro pocket that is large enough for a wallet, checkbook etc."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Another great Columbia product!,5,"Like most Columbia products, this is a very high quality jacket that fits and works as it should. I love the colors, too! I'm a somewhat big guy, and with a size L, I was easily able to fit this over my fleece and T-Shirt while hiking through the Big Basin Redwood Forest. That's exactly what I wanted, something with a little room, so I could wear something warmer underneath. This jacket has proven to be excellent for keeping rain off of me, but it is very thin and will provide virtually no warmth. It's thinness is great, because I can roll it up and toss it in my backpack or suitcase with ease."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Loooove this jacket!,5,"This is the perfect jacket! If you’re looking for something extremely lightweight that you can throw over anything that you’re wearing one it is raining, this will be the item for you. I wrote on here that it fit a little bigger but I think that was the intention of my purchase, and buying a size large. My husband works in the construction field. When he meets with homeowners or builders sometimes it’s raining outside. This is perfect for him to throw over whatever he has on site doesn’t get wet."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Keeps me dry,5,"It’s a basic rain jacket that keeps me dry in a downpour. It has a relaxed fit which I appreciate getting in and out of my car in the rain. The hood can be folded up, tucked, and button under the collar when not in use. It’s a good value for a rain jacket. I recommend it."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Fit as expected.,5,Great fit.  I received another name brand jacket in the same size and it did not fit at all.  The Columbia Jacket fit great.  The is room to wear a heavy shirt under it for the real cool days.  Light weight which meets my needs here in mid-Florida.  Water proof for those rainy days during the summer months.  Sleeves have a Velcro adjustment and there is a drawstring in the inside bottom of the jacket to keep it as tight as you wish.  Hood hidden in the collar.  Overall a great jacket.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Not waterproof or windproof,1,"Advertised as waterproof rain jacket, definitely is not. I don't recommend buying this jacket. I've had the same problem as the other 1 star reviews. Water creeps in quickly, and it retains it, and you get soaked. I thought it was sweat because it was less breathable than advertised, but water was seeping through the hood as well. I went on a quick hike knowing it was moderately rainy to test it out.The jacket would stick to my skin it was so soaked. The wind cut right through, which caused a dangerous amount of heat loss due to being wet. It's funny, because just before this hike, I held the jacket up to a light and saw many fine gaps in the outer layer, but I had faith as it is a well liked brand."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Finally a nice Columbia rain jacket that fits a big guy,5,When I ordered this jacket I liked the design and color and I have always liked the quality of the Columbia line of outerwear. I have never been able to get one in my size (6X) though and I doubted that this one would fit me. Imagine my surprise when it arrived and fit as advertised. Now I look good in bad weather.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,The more ya know,5,"I love the look of this jacket and the hidden hood feature. It is very clearly waterproof, except for one particular location. Those that have given it 1 star just did not go through the effort to test it. It is the stitching that says Columbia over the left breast that is not waterproof. If this area is soaked, then the water will eventually run down the front of your chest inside the jacket. Protect this area from the rain or find a way to make the stitching waterproof and this jacket will prove to be a good purchase."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Sizes seem to run large, Medium fit me perfectly (normally I wear Large)",5,"I ordered this in the summer so haven't had many opportunities to use it, but I love the material and am excited to use it more this fall. I did use it on one big hike recently and it worked great (and my significant other said they like how I look in it, so there's that). I had ordered a couple other similar jackets and had issues with the sizing. Based on the reviews with this one, I ordered a medium. I was happy to find that it fit me perfectly (I'm 6'1"" & 185 lbs with an athletic build). Whether it's ""real"" Columbia I cannot tell, but the tag is convincing that it is."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Lightweight waterproof windbreaker,5,"I got this jacket for my boyfriend. He's 6'3 and 360+lbs. He's super hard to find clothes for, so when I saw they offered all the way to a 6X I was excited. We were doing some traveling for Christmas and he needed a jacket. I picked this because I thought it would do as a good windbreaker. 100% satisfied with it. It's a little bigger than expected, but this left room for layering underneath. He also finds that it's super warm even though it's extremely lightweight. I think that the material is not breathable at all so it helps keep rain out, wind out, and body heat in. And it does this without a lot of movement restriction or feeling bulky."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Condensation forms on the inside during rains (will sweat).,5,"Helped me with the cold wind and rain when we went to visit BC. The jacket is a 100% waterproof, but condensation forms on the inside during rains (will sweat).The inside lining of the jacket is netted as well as the pockets. The pockets are a little thin but very safe when we used it for our small (important) things while doing some activities.The rain jacket is very light too, so we were very happy with it and will but it again in the future."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Good jacket for golf.,5,I actually ordered 2 sizes. Ordered 3XL and 4XL. I was looking for a rain jacket for golf so I wanted a little more roomier fit.Not sure if sizing was off but the 3XL would not even go around my stomach area. The 4XL was large but thats what I was looking for. Major difference between sizes.Quality seems very good. Nice light material for golf. Also has attached hood that packs inside the collar area.Have not tried in the rain yet so I cant comment on that. Did spray light water on it and it worked. Only time will tell.At this time I would not hesitate to purchase anothernone of these jackets. Keeping fingers crossed that it works as good as it looks.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,NOT Fully lined.,3,"I'll start with the good... This is a good jacket. It fits as I expected it to and the quality is what you'd expect from Columbia. The pockets are generously sized and the hood works well.That being said, the only parts of this jacket to feature mesh lining are the two front panels.  The entire back and the sleeves are unlined; so if used as a light windbreaker or warm-weather rain jacket, the perspiration starts quickly and has nowhere to go."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,The best windbreaker on the market,5,"This jacket is a deal. It's able to almost anywhere. Backpacks, small pocket books ect. I have two of these. One under my seat of my truck in case it rains and another in my camping bag.Warm, thin, and dry. Made well."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,I ordered one at too big,5,"Now normally I wear a 3xl tall in shirts, but this 3xlt was super big and I had to return it, but I liked the way jacket was built so I’m ordering a smaller size next time, I weigh 290lbs and I’m 6’2” too"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Good water proof and wind proof jacket,5,"I purchased this coat after being caught in a surprise hail storm this summer. Used it this weekend in a snow storm, and it served me very well. I wore it over my winter fleece jacket, found it to be wind and water proof, and kept me warm without over heating me. I'm a woman who probably wears a men's medium, but wanted a jacket large enough to fit over my coat  I'm 5' 6"" and it comes to mid thigh on me. I really like it, and the color I chose."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Neither water resistant or water proof (both of which are used to describe this jacket) know the difference,1,"For a packable jacket I hadn't expected much from it to begin with. I am unsure as to how a jacket like this has such great reviews. I understand the difference between water-proof and water-resistant. The description states ""Water-repellant"" while a chart further down the page claims it's made of waterproof fabric. This jacket is neither water repellant or water proof. I wouldn't even wear this in a situation where it was my only option. I was caught in the beginning of a rain storm while replacing a new mail box since the original had been broken into (USPS Mechanic). The beginning of the storm was very light rain, within 3 minutes of said light rain the jacket and my shirt underneath were thoroughly soaked. Don't waste your time with this, by a real rain jacket."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great for casual use,3,Just finished an overnight backpacking trip.  I bought this jacket earlier this year though haven't had an opportunity to test it out due to the drought.  I love this jacket for light rain and as a windbreaker function.  On this recent backpacking trip I got caught in a steady rain for a couple of hours.  Initially the jacket kept me dry though gradually the rain soaked through and I was completely wet.  When I raised my water bottle to drink I could feel water running down the underside of my arm.  I'll use this jacket for wind protection and light rain protection.  For serious outdoor use I'll need to go back to the researching out something different.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Not even remotely waterproof.,1,"The jacket looks great and it is comfortable. Be wary of the size, I am 6 feet tall, yet the small worked for me.UPDATE:Honestly, this jacket is pretty mediocre. I've worn this many times and it never seems to be truly water repellent. My gear underneath always seems to get pretty damp. Sure, it keeps you from getting completely soaked, and in a light rain it might be okay for a bit. But it is soon saturated and will begin to seep water through to lower layers.I have tried several times to re-coat with DWR, and while that has helped, it is still not waterproof enough to be satisfactory. I would not bother with this jacket if you're looking for something actually waterproof."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Good jacket, needs a better zipper.",4,I've used this jacket on numerous walks and camps in all kinds of weather.  It makes a fair rain jacket as it will soak through in continuous rain in 5 to 10 minutes.  The mesh liner let's you dry faster and makes the jacket good for warm weather as it breathes.  Minus a star due to zipper starting to strip (pulls apart) after only a few months.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great early fall/spring jacket for light rains.,4,"I'm 5'7"" with a large frame - got size Large.  It fits nice and loose on me, but that's expected in a layering/rain jacket.  Slightly baggy in the arms on the wrists, but nothing wrong there.  My cousin is about 5'10"" 180lbs and it seems to fit him more ""right"".It's not really made to keep you warm, but it's comfortable if it's cool and breezy out.  As a rain jacket, it stands up alright to a sprinkling or light rain for a short period of time (say 20-30 mins or so).  A decent rain it starts wicking moisture through the embroidered logos and after a while will start penetrating through the shoulders.  At this price, I don't think it was ever meant to be the most water resistant or all purpose sort of jacket.Keep it for light rain in not-so-prolonged intervals and for layering if needed in colder temperatures."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Five Stars,5,"Update after owning 2 years:This jacket could become sentient and try to kill me in my sleep, it would still get 5 stars. This item has stood the test of time and still keeps me dry, even when the rain is coming down so hard you don't know whether to walk or swim. It's so light, it should be a mandatory item for hikes and backpacking. It stuffs into a tiny little ball, so you can keep it anywhere. It looks good too, so points for style.Pros:Fits great, price is right. I've been camping, hunting, and hiking with it. This year the Elk hunt was BRUTAL, it rained the whole time. Even though all my other waterproof/resistant gear eventually soaked through, anything under this jacket stayed dry. I wear it when I bike to work if it rains. I have gotten more than the $30 worth of use out of it. I have snagged it a few times in branches and it hasn't ripped.Cons:Not vented, so If you are exerting yourself during a warmer rain, you'll get wet from your own sweat anyway."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great Purchase,5,I bought this for my husband as his job requires him to occasionally be out in the rain. He gets in and out of his work truck repeatedly. It is super lightweight and has good pockets. The hood is rolled up in a zipper case that doesn’t bother him at the neckline. The fabric feels good and it fits really well. I’d purchase this again.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Has ""rain jacket"" in the title, not actually a good ""rain jacket""",2,I've withheld this feedback for some time because I wasn't sure if I was wet underneath due to water seeping through or because of sweat. Today I used max pedal assist in a very light rain and there were definitely splotches of wetness underneath where I wouldn't normally sweat. Disappointing. Search begins for a replacement.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Large was closer to an Extra Large,4,Overall I like this jacket. I ordered a Lg but it was more like an extra large.  Amazon exchanged it with no issue for a Medium which is definitely a better fit for me.  Ideally something between their medium and large would be perfect.  But the medium should work out well.  This is good jacket for the price.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Zipper failed after a few uses,1,"I bought this jacket for my adult son for an August birthday .  It fit well and looked good.  However, we had 90 degree weather for 60 days so it did not see use until October.  The third time he used the jacket, the zipper failed.  I stuck at about 1/4 of the way up.  None of us can budge it.  The zipper is clearly defective, there appears to be a tooth (?) of the zipper sticking out where the puller is.  So  the jacket is useless.  Too late to send it back.  A big disappointment to say the least."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Very nice jackets good price,4,"I've bought two of these now, the second one because I wore the first one so much that it got a bit worse for wear, and it seemed to lose a bit of its waterproof-ness (is that a word?).  My only complaint about both is that the velcro that cinches the sleeves tight could stand to be a bit stronger in grip, and might be better if it went farther around the cuff.  Otherwise, no complaints."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Nice jacket,5,3 xlt good jacket I bought it a little bigger then needed so I could use it with a sweater under nether in the fall and early spring n and in the summer for a rain jacket .
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great wind shell and good looking product,5,"Great product.  Don't understand why some customers think it should be waterproof.  It is Nylon and only water resistant.  I ordered Large and was surprised to find it fit like a tent!  Replaced with Medium which is perfect.  I am 5'10"" 175# and usually wear a large jacket but Medium fits just perfectly for this particular jacket.  I highly recommend this as a great wind shell and nice looking jacket."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Does okay but not totally breathable.,4,Purchased for an extended trip to Italy last month. Nice packable design was easy to tote and wound up using it a number of times. Overall the product works however the sleeves are not lined like the rest of the jacket and it's causing sweating as it traps body heat and air. (Minus 1 star.) So it is not entirely breathable as touted in the ad. Suggest a long sleeve shirt when wearing (if possible). I purchased the XL and it was slightly large but okay if wearing heavier clothing.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,It fits as predicted,5,"I had been looking for a light water proof jacket for a while and this one has fit the need.I had my reservations on ordering a jacket based on the size guidelines of the web page. However, they proved to be perfectly accurate. The sleeves are a bit long for me but the adjustable Velcro straps, together with the elastic on the cuffs, allow for an adequate fit.It is very light and it can be packed in a very small space.Great product."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great value,5,"This jacket replaced my previous one, which was the same item! I loved the first one--wore it out! So happy to find that Columbia is still  making it because it's an outstanding jacket. Keeps me dry on long walks, great hood (which fits perfectly into the collar), nice pockets, perfect with just a t-shirt or heavy sweatshirt or a combo. Fit is perfect."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Rip off.,3,"This item is a very poor quality. When I took it out of the package it had a slit/cut in the fabric. They accepted the return though and I fortunately got a refund. They told me it was a Columbia but I find it difficult to believe that fact, maybe Columbia has farmed everything out to Chinese manufacturers.  Disappointed."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"A nice, packable waterproof windbreaker",5,"I was looking for a light spring/summer rain jacket and this fit the bill.  I bought a size up to allow room for a fleece or vest beneath for cooler days and it was sized exactly as I expected having used Columbia jackets in the past.  It folds small enough to fit easily in a backpack, and does a nice job of shielding me from wind and light rain.The one negative was a lack of cord/tab zipper pulls on the pockets, but that was easily fixed with some paracord.  The metal pull alone is a bit small for my fingers."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great Price Great Fit,5,"I ordered an extra large, 5.11"" 190 lbs.  as I wanted extra room and I'm glad I did.  I can still get a heavier sweater underneath if I need it.  The velcro cuffs are great and the zippered pockets are just what I wanted for keys and a wallet.  Wore in the rain and rain rolled right off. Would not hesitate to buy again."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Works well in the pacific northwest rain!,5,"I moved from MO to WA and started working 60+ hours outside, 6 days a week in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. Now, what does it do almost everyday save summer in the PNW? RAIN. I stood in the pouring rain (as much as WA ever ""pours"") for countless hours on people's roofs and on ladders running cabling. It held up. If you need something waterproof that fits and doesn't tear easily, here's your jacket."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,A bizarre Sweat Suit.... but I have got a few complements on its appearance.,3,"I was looking for a windbreaker and Amazon took me to this. I guess I didn't realize that this was a sauna suit. After wearing it for just a few minutes in the cold, my back was drenched with sweat. The front is not that insulated or waterproof so this leaves you rather chilled... while soaked in your own sweat. Bizarre."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Nice light-weight rain jacket,4,"I bought this as an alternative to an umbrella.  It is very lightweight.  There is no liner, other than some mesh inside on the front, so it's not great for warmth.  But I wanted a light jacket.  I plan to wear mine over another jacket on cold days.  Overall, it's very good for what I wanted.  I ordered a Large and it is slightly larger than my other size L jackets."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Best light weather jacket we've ever owned.,5,"Ok we bought these to give us a new light weight raincoat while traveling in S. AU and NZ for 6 weeks, our old raincoats were about 15 years old and starting to show ware. Well it rained, drizzled, rained, and blew (wind chilled) us the whole 6 weeks. We didn't know from hour to hour what the weather was going to be like; and these light weight rain jackets were the best we could have hoped for! (period).You could tuck the whole jacket in a pocket or purse, then pop it out in about 10 secs and have it on again, it kept us dry and broke the wind. It was loose enough to have two good layers over a shirt or blouse when we needed it (and on a few days we really need to keep warm).Well all I can say is these will always accompany us future travels, they are great in moderate weather."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Wish I'd bought sooner.,4,I placed it on my list and forgot about it until recently I was trying to spend a gift card and saw it. I'm not sure why I didn't just buy it originally but when it finally arrived I liked it so much I got one for my father who is also picky like I am.My only complaint was on initial use the zipper stuck and was a pain to adjust. My father had the exact same issue. We got it working and hope it doesn't come back again in fall when the jackets will actually get used.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Good product,4,"Nice and lightweight for spring/summer. Keeps you dry, but the hood has no securing mechanism, so wind blows it off or to the side...you have to keep the hood in place with your hand. Still, a nice purchase."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great multi-purpose jacket; runs a little big,5,"I bought this jacket for my husband as a multi-purpose fall jacket. It's a great windbreaker and light rain jacket for walking to and from the car. Definitely runs a little large, but I expected that from reading other reviews, and it's fine so he can wear thicker clothes underneath if it's both cold and rainy. He hasn't worn it out in heavy rain yet, so I don't know how well it would hold up under those conditions. As a multi-purpose fall/spring jacket, it's great."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,The Material,3,"This jacket is obviously for my husband.  It fits well and is nice to look at.  However, he wore it this morning in the grocery store since those stores are generally quite cool and, unfortunately, had to take it off after less than 10 minutes (I still had to to leave my cardigan sweater on so it was not that the store was warm).  It was only then that we noticed the material is not normal windbreaker material (typically nylon) but a material that has almost a rubber feel to it.  This jacket would probably do well in colder climates but if you are hot-natured, it is not good at all."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,#2,5,"This is the second time I have ordered this jacket for my husband. The first one is over 4 years old and has been through so much hiking, backpacking, working etc. It is very much stained and discolored due to washes and such (but still NO HOLES and in WORKING CONDITION). The second jacket is just as well made as the first. If you are looking for a good lightweight rain jacket this is it. I have also ordered the kids version for my son twice (as he grew out of the first), his have held up just as well as my husbands. Love these."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Keeps you dry.,5,"This is my second one of these. Lost a bunch of weight so I had to get a smaller size. It does awesome in the rain, keeps you dry. I love that it is packable. Keep in my daily backpack I care back and forth to work everyday. It also fits in a cargo pocket. I highly recommend this jacket."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Handsome jacket, flattering--but don't buy too big",5,"The material feels great and repels light rain with ease. It has a handsome and warm look. It's great for those misty spring days that are around 62 to 72 F.  I'm sure it will be great for some of those windy and warm October and November days. I've been buying Columbia jackets for all my life. The only ones I don't use anymore are the ones I've accidentally lost while hiking, camping, or while on a bar crawl. If you're have an under 32 waist get a small.  32 waist to 36 will be fine for medium (true measure, not wishful measure.)"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Deceptively warm!,4,"This jacket is great at what it's advertised for, keeping rain/snow/sleet out. It is very waterproof and lightweight, making it perfect for the days when the weather is uncertain. That being said, despite not having a super fancy lining inside, this jacket gets extremely warm inside, to the point where I was sweating even in 30-40 degree weather. By the end of an entire day wearing it, I was pretty wet from sweat rather than rain."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Chaqueta liviana con materiales de calidad y bien construida,5,"Mido 1.70 centímetros,  se ajustó a mis hombros y largo de brazos,  me llega mas abajo del cinturón del pantalón. la chaqueta tiene  ajuste con velcro en las muñecas que me gustó mucho, la capota para la cabeza tiene un añadido que  da mas protección a  la cara en caso de lluvia, tiene dos bolsillos laterales con cierre, y tiene un bolsillo interno a la altura del pecho al lado izquierdo para empaquetar la chaqueta,  el material se nota ligero pero de buena calidad, aun no he probado la chaqueta bajo la lluvia, trae una etiqueta que dice ""WaterProof"".. me habria gustado que la tela de malla también cubra la espalda, solo cubre la parte frontal de la chaqueta, este detalle se puede inferir de las fotos del producto al momento de comprar."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Columbia is great quality at an affordable price,5,"Fits well, at shoulder and waist especially. I can't wear LL Bean or Nike because I have thick shoulders. This jacket is a rain jacket to be worn over other clothes, like sweaters and sweatshirts when it rains, so I bought a size larger. Good quality construction. I am already a fan of Columbia products. This jacket did not disappoint. Very good price with this seller at this time too!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great Lightweight Windbreaker with Hideaway Hood -- Fits As Expected,5,"This is a very lightweight rain jacket. Back in the day we'd call this a windbreaker, but it still does a great job keeping the rain off. The construction on this is amazing -- all seams are expertly stitched and you can tell this is a quality Columbia product. The pockets are mesh, so you can keep them unzipped for extra ventilation during those hot rainy months. It also has a pouch where you can stuff the jacket into for storage which is also nice.The 2x size for the Big and Tall version of this jacket fit as expected."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Perfect for rain,4,"I was looking for a rain jacket for the rain in Bogotá, everybody in the city knows that you have to carry on a umbrella. I was tired to lose any umbrella that i bought. That's why i decide to buy this jacket, it's a good price and it is going to work for my needs, and it's packable.I have used twice in the rain. It works perfect, I never wet from the rain. But some comments are true:1. it's lightweight and the material is really thin. So if you are going to use it in cold weather it's better that you wear a sweater under the jacket.2. if you use it for a while, or in a sunny day, the condensation inside the jacket is going to happen. You are going to find water inside the jacket, not from the rain, it's because the condensation inside the jacket. The heat from the body stays inside the jacket, so you going to see water inside.3. it's too large!! A bought a Small, but doesn't fit well. I'm going to use it, but it's too large for my size.4. the hood is really good. In a windy rain, the hood is so usefull. The best is to pack the hood inside the jacket's neck.The style is cool, works for the rain, I like it, but it's a jacket with some problems."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Very happy with this purchase,5,"I am very pleased with the purchase of this jacket.  It was exactly what I needed for our eastern Canada road trip.  It looks good, fits well and appears to be well made.  I also like the velcro straps at the cuffs that will seal out the wind.Like that the hood is enclosed in the collar unlike some jackets where the hood hangs out.  Though I wasn't in heavy rain, it seemed to seal out the rain during light showers."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Not sized for average built men.,1,"I'm 5'8"" 152lbs the chest and waist are fine, but the arms are far too big. If you prefer your jackets oversized thats fine but even then the proportions seem a tad off.Would not recommend this for those of you that are runners/at least semi athletic. I bought a small and it was still a bit large on the body and again the arm sleeves were massive."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,No Mesh lining,2,"I have a Columbia jacket with mesh lining inside, absolutely love it and wanted one for my son before we take our trip out west. This one does not have mesh lining and makes the jacket stick to the skin and uncomfortably. I would only recommend the mesh lined Columbia water/wind resistant."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Irma proof,5,"I bought this rain jacket to take to Maine for our vacation from Florida .  Irma had another idea. Our trip was delayed, but I got to test the jacket out the morning after Irma rolled through. Ok, it wasn't hurricane conditions, but it wasn't a pretty summer day either.  This jacket is slightly large and I consider that perfect.  I can wear it over a tee or layer up on a colder day.  It does exactly what I want.  BTW, it did great in Maine too, once I got there."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great jacket - but order a size or two bigger than you normally wear.,5,"Great Jacket. Fits well! I’m a big guy, I usually wear a 4x in shirts so I figured 1 or 2 sizes larger on the jacket. So I ordered a 6x & it fits perfectly! I know that a 4x would have been way to tight."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Not my kinda jacket,2,"This jacket's inner lining is kind of rubbery, which means it does not breathe at all. I walked home from work in the rain (about 50 degree weather) and my body was as wet as the outside of the jacket due to sweat. This jacket feels like a steam room on the inside and I thought that it was going to be lighter weight enough to somewhat breathe. And like the description/reviews say, this jacket is only effective at keeping rain off you in situations of LIGHT rain. Anything moderate to heavy, you will be soaked. If there's one thing I do like about this jacket, it's that it does compact really well into the built-in pouch."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Not Waterproof. Not Breathable.,1,Looks good. Nice color. 1 thing has to happen with a rainwear.  You have to be dry. This did not happen.  Rain soaked through. And I was cold. A jacket is useless if you are cold.  Columbia has proprietary technology for waterproofing. None of the technology was used for this product.  Just a thin piece of polyester. Simple mesh on front of jacket only.  Nothing on the back. No vents.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Its a dandy,5,"Super awesome.  This is the second one of these coats I have bought.  I lost the other one and really missed it.  What I like it that it is a shell only.  It is good for warm climates.  I already have a coat with a liner a you end up getting wet from the inside out as opposed to the outside in.  This shell is good for limited exposure to rain and is best described as water resistant, not water proof.  If you want waterproof, get a pvc coat.  This is best for in and out of car type rain.  Not all day exposed to rain."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Great, lightweight raincoat that travels well!",5,"Overall, this was a great, lightweight raincoat. I took a trip to Japan during their typhoon season and it worked perfectly. I have dreadlocks, but the hood was just big enough to fit my hair inside, but I wish it were slightly bigger. My locks would sometimes get caught in the Velcro that the hood is tucked under. The jacket is compact and easily folds to fit into a backpack if needed. Overall, pretty good!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Nice jacket for the price,5,"This is a great jacket for $29. It has velcro at sleeves if you want to tighten also pockets. I'm 5'10"" weigh about 165 and a medium fits me perfectly. I usually wear a large but due to some reviews that it's a bit on the larger size I opted for the medium. Recommend Columbia make good products."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Like the Jacket but ....,4,"I have an earlier version of this jacket that has a smaller collar and fits looser, both which I like.  This was tight fitting and the collar dominates the jacket, which I didn't like.  Also, the earlier model had a dark blue color that's missing from the current offering."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Excellent product and value!,5,My love for Columbia clothing is decades in the making. The only thing that bummed me out about this particular item is that unlike jackets in the past this has a draw string waist cincher on only ONE side. Still gets the job done but liked them on both sides as prior purchases.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,handsome jacket wind breaker with fine details,5,"I got this 3 XL so it would be roomy with a sweatshirt. It fit perfect and looks great. Lots of interior pockets and a niche shell as opposed to a lining so this can be worn all season. Love that it is roomy enough to be comfortable, driving, hiking and even to a board meeting it is that versatile and attractive. Hood fits inside liner and the jacket is foldable/packable so it can always be on hand for inclement wet weather. Haven't wore it in the rain yet but the jacket appears very durable."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,I HAVE A FEW OF THEM,5,Bought a few of these jackets love the simplicity of the jacket need to stay warmer just get the vest also wind proof and warm need no thermals on the uppers when you have this jacket and the pricefor warmth is a joke DO BUY OR BE COLD FOR MORE MONEY
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Probably a good coat, but wouldn't know since I'm incapable of zipping this coat up.",1,"If you enjoy a jammed zipper half way up Everytime you use this coat, this is the one to get. The thin flap on the inside forces you to zip this coat up millimeter by millimeter while using your left hand to push the zipper flap in, and if you miss even the smallest amount, it will get sucked into the zipper and lead to you just throwing it on the ground till the next rain."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,High Quality & Comfortable Jacket,5,"Bought this Columbia jacket in Adult Small for rainy or cool days for my 13 year old son. It is really nice and arrived quickly and in time for a trip.  It packs easily, and the red and gray color looks great.  He has recently grown out of youth x-large and so the adult small was perfect choice with its drawstring to tighten at bottom. The hood is tucked away with velcro and easy to open or put away. My son really likes it. Thumbs up!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Columbia men’s jacket,1,Too large.Compared what is available at the outlets was an inferior product.The outlet had better price and[roduct.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Needed a rain coat,4,"I purchased this jacket due to not having any type of rain wear.  Fortunately i purchased it when i did as it's been raining a lot here in the south this year.  This jacket has been great, fits well and loose, but that's how i like it.  The only complaint would be the hood, seems to come down on my forehead some but otherwise a great jacket and would purchase again."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Waterproof and decent fit,4,"Arm length was a little longer than expected on the tall-long but too short on tall-regular.  Not the jackets fault but would be nicer if there was an in between.Otherwise the product is good, resilient and rain proof as expected.  Not as breathable as some rain proof jackets I've owned but for this price I wasn't expecting much.To use as just a wear to work kind of rain coat, I would probably buy again"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Terrible,1,"I got this as a lightweight jacket for use in cooler weather. I've worn it a couple times on walks with cooler temperatures, and I come back soaked from sweat. I actually felt the water dripping from the sleeves, I don't know what material this is, but creates a very uncomfortable feeling on the inside of the jacket. From what I've read from the other reviews, I don't think I'll be wearing this in the rain either."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,My Black\Grill 2X Plus NOT as Pictured,2,"My Black\Grill (misspelled from gray?) in 2X Plus size differed from the image in that it is not two-toned (and has no yoke as pictured). It's entirely black. It does not have a  hood. It does not have velcro adjustable cuffs as pictured. The cuffs on mine were simple 1/4"" slightly-elastic edging. A plain sort of jacket. My star rating is based upon the product that I actually received.Almost forgot the amusing part: There was a US nickel in one of the pockets. A returned item? Good luck charm? I'm serious."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Good protection against wind and light rain.,5,"This jacket has been great for when I need a light weight wind breaker that doesn't overheat. It has also served well at shedding light rain, I haven't used it in heavy rain yet. I also like how well it can be rolled up and compressed, packing it in my backpack when I didn't need it. I ordered mine a size large to easily fit over extra layers as needed. Fits well, and is comfortable."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,NOT WATERPROOF,3,"We were out on the beach in Costa Rica looking for baby turtles in a rain storm. The jacket soaked through very quickly. I tested it when I received it and saw that the water just beads up and runs off. But that is not the case for even a short use in the rain. I like the fit and its weight, just not the waterproof part. I didn't want to buy a heavy rain jacket for Costa Rica, as you might guess."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,3x a lot bigger than normal,4,"I normally wear a size 3x jacket, however this jacket is very big in the arm areas, it stops at the wrist, which is to be expected, but it is very large, much larger than the rest of the jacket. I tighten the wrist strap, which helped a little, but you could still fit 3 arms in one of the sleeves. I bought this as a windbreaker. not a rain jacket, haven't used it in rain, but in wind it's comfortable. It's like it was made for someone with very saggy arms, order a size down if you buy one."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Good quality easily packable.  Does not breathe.,4,"This is a nice quality jacket and it is lightweight and easy to pack for travel.  As other reviewers have noted, it does not breathe at all.  If you are wearing to keep off rain in a warmer environment or if you are engaged in any physical exertion you will sweat like a pig.  On the other hand, if it's cold out, this will keep you pretty warm despite it's very light weight."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Too Big,4,"Got this jacket for my fiancé. He is 6ft1 and around 250 pounds. Most regular clothing tends to be somewhat short on him but he wears a 2xl t shirt so I thought just xl tall would be okay. It’s pretty big on him in general and really swishy, like 90s track suit swishy. We haven’t tried in out in the elements yet but it seems like it would be awesome for a rainy day."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,WATERPROOF AND COMFY,5,"Im a man of comfort. I like to always be comfortable even at work. I really needed a rain jacket for the days that does rain in Austin, TX and this things rocks. It folds nicely in my moped compartment and Orange is my favorite color. Couldn't ask for a better Jacket, and this thing has pocket for days. That's why it gets five STARZ"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Quality Rain Jacket,5,It's a very nice jacket. Just days after I bought it I rode my bicycle in moderate rain and worked very well. The jacket is fairly breathable. I don't get sweat in it. I am 6' 190 lbs and large fits me well.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Overall nice jacket so far.,4,"I'm happy with this purchase. I am very pleased with the fit. There were a couple things I didn't like with the jacket. One, it feels a tad bit flimsy, very thin. Im scared if I'm too rough with it it might rip. Two, I purchased the green and black color which looks lighter in person. I was expecting it to be darker like the picture. Water does bead off the jacket but I have yet to try it in an actual rainy day event."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Sleeves,4,"This jacket was everything I wanted and expected except........................I have to use a 3X but even for this size, the sleeves were waaayyyyy too long....So, on top of the cost, I had to pay a tailor $20 to shorten each sleeve appropriately.....I'm keeping it because it's really what I want......"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Not Even Water-Resistant,1,"The jacket couldn’t hold up to a 40-second walk from the parking lot to my building. It soaked straight through in the Florida drizzle and I arrived to my destination with drenched clothes; as if I had no protection at all. The jacket is also loud when you move around, so it would still be useless as a light indoor jacket."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Light but not flimsy, good fit, wrists a little small",4,"I'm a 5'6"" woman who wears L in women or 10/12. I ordered a Large.The wrists feel a bit smaller than I would expect considering the body/arms are roomy on me. The hood feels like it covers really well. It seems pretty light but not flimsy. I got an L to have room for clothes underneath and I think I'd have no problem with a normal shirt or light jacket, but anything heavier than that would not fit unless I ordered an XL"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"The hood is overly long in front and hangs down in front of eyes, obscurring vision.",3,"I can't see!  Seriously, I had to keep pulling the hood back up over my eyes, even with the drawstrings cinched!  If the wearer wants to have a cap or hat on, this would probably be fine, but without something to hold the hood above the eyes, it's terrible about blocking vision."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Perfect for layering or just to block the rain,5,"Bought for my husband for upcoming trip.  He is 5'8 and wears a size 36 pants.  He prefers XL tops to large, so I went up a size.  The XL looks great and is the perfect size for anyone 5'8-6 that prefers extra room-he loves it.  We tried it on with a Sherpa lined fleece and it was the perfect size for layering for our trip.  If you want something truer to size or to wear in the summer, size L would be perfect with thinner layers."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,... because I was worried about my son who doesn't like to take a jacket when it's cold,4,"I bought this jacket because I was worried about my son who doesn't like to take a jacket when it's cold.Because the jacket is lightweight, soft, and comfortable, he wore this jacket everyday to school.I chose Columbia because long ago when I was a teenager like my son, I wore Columbia cold wear.I like the design and fashion of Columbia and I figured my son would too.But I do have to say the color fades out ( I bought him a black jacket) and I don't wash it that much.Next time I will wash it in Woolite instead of regular detergent."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great windbreaker / rain jacket!,5,"Fits a bit large, but I did somewhat expect that being a Columbia.  Very well made and absolutely perfect for a light rain/wind jacket down south when you just need a bit extra.  The ability to pack into the interior pocket is nice if you want to drop into a briefcase or backpack just in case, but it does wrinkle the heck out of it.  Would definitely recommend and buy again when needed, and the price was great.  I also like the fact the hood can be rolled up into the collar if you don't need it."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great performance for excellent value,5,I read a lot of the reviews for this product before deciding to purchase and I noticed a lot of reviews mentioned that they thought they received a counterfeit. I have another Columbia rain jacket that I purchased from a brick-and-mortar retailer and the jacket I received was a perfect match. I saw no indication that this product is a nothing other than a genuine Columbia product.I have worn this rain jacket in wet weather several times now and it has performed as expected.  Columbia outerwear always seems to run a little larger than other brands which is perfect for my extra wide shoulders. Great value!
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Light weight packable rain and wind shell.,5,"I'm a big guy,  5' 11"" and  260 lbs. The extra large fits perfectly with room for a mid weight fleece underneath. I've worn this in rain and wind, and cool fog, and its kept my dry and comfortable.  It folds up small taking little space in my day pack, and is very lightweight. Its held up over two multi week trips and a good bit of use here at home."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Solid,5,Love how lightweight these are its my second one. This one seems slightly thiner than the one i bought 5-6 years ago. Easy to pack into a packet and zip up. They can trap a little bit of moisture inside like most rain jackets.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Maybe Good for Something, but Not for What I Needed",1,"I bought this jacket as a Christmas gift for myself for a fairly specific purpose.  As someone who spends most of his time in either Austin, TX or the Coastal Bend, I wanted a lightweight jacket I could wear when I run around downtown Austin and to throw over something else on other rainy days.  Being familiar with Columbia and finding a great deal on something that appeared to actually be available in my size here on Amazon, I ordered the jacket.When the jacket arrived, I was quite pleased to find that it actually fit.  I'm a large 6'4 with a 52'- 54' chest, 38-38.5 length arms, 18.5'-19' neck, app. 18' arm circumference, and unusually broad shoulders (I believe 66'), which makes buying clothes off the rack exceptionally difficult.  I ordered a XXLT and to my surprise, the jacket is actually about an inch longer than I need in the arms and otherwise fits pretty much perfectly for what I wanted.  I also really liked the adjustable wrists that one can use to tighten the jacket as necessary.However, that being said, there are some serious issues I have with the jacket.  First, the jacket does not breathe at all.  I've only worn it about 4 times thus far in Austin and each time it has been less that 72 Degrees Fahrenheit out and no more than 70% humidity.  Each time, even when simply walking I have found myself literally dripping with sweat.  It's so bad, the sweat literally runs down my arms and pours out the sleeves.  Today, when wearing dry fit shorts, base layer shorts, and socks, and a very light polyester/linen blend t-shirt and carrying a small light backpack after less than a mile of basic walking, I found myself absolutely drenched.  I had to take it off outside before I went inside to keep the sweat from dripping off all over the floor.  The one time I wore it as a light outer shell over jeans and a button down, I was so drenched, I probably would have been better off just walking through the rain.  Second, there is no liner in the sleeves, so although they are roomy enough to allow my larger than average arms to fit in them comfortably, it means that as soon as I start sweating they cling to my arms like saran wrap making it quite uncomfortable.  Third, the hoodie cannot be adequately tightened and very difficult to keep on without a cap when walking in wind.  Fourth and finally, the velcro on the jacket used to compress the jacket in its internal pouch catches quite easily on the liner of the jacket.  This is fairly minor, but a design flaw nonetheless.This jacket may be good in colder places with little humidity (which probably isn't the case if it's raining) as an outer layer windbreaker and moisture protective shell, but is extremely ill suited for use in the south or anywhere one intends to wear it without a full base layer when engaging in anything that will remotely increase one's core temperature.  As such, as a light rain jacket for use in Austin, Texas,  it is an absolute failure thus far and it's not even summer yet."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Good packable rain shell,5,"It functions well as a raincoat. However it does not breathe at all. It is made of vinyl that has a distinctive odor to it. The fit is tolerable, but it is somewhat large. The best thing about it is that it can be carried in a backpack folded up when not in use.I liked the rain shell enough that I got one for my girlfriend. She really likes it. It's hard to go wrong with Columbia products. I just wish the jacket could breathe. If worn when hiking or physical activity a garment should be able to dissipate moisture from sweat. The shells good points outweigh the bad. It's a good product at its price point. I would recommend this jacket"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"DOES NOT BREATHE, IS NOT WATER PROOF, AND SIZE RUNS LARGE",2,"I thought I would be pleased with this jacket because I have always liked the Columbia brand.  However, although I don't usually perspire much, my shirt underneath was wet with the slightest movement because it does not breathe. It is not water proof, allowing you to get wet from the rain.  When ordering, be aware that you should probably order a smaller size.  These are bigger than normal.  I am returning it and am awaiting a return authorization."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Saved a vacation,5,"I bought this for a visit to the UK . As expected, it rained at least half the time we were there. The jacket never let in one drop of water and let out enough vapor at up to 65 degrees F that I didn't get damp from sweat. The hood is a little awkward but considering the cost and the alternative (getting soaked) I have no serious issues with it. It also packs very small and is light weight."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,The packing bag doesn't match the one shown,2,"Columbia Glennaker, black-greyAs it can be seen in my photo, compared to the ones published, once packed, the ""bag"" is made of a net, not like the outside lining of the jacket (I know it's just a personal preference, and it might be exaggerated, but I wanted the one shown on the published photos...)"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Good quality material… Haven’t tried it out in the rain yet.,5,So far the quality looks good and feels good and the jacket did fit when I tried it on. I have not had the chance to try it out in the rain yet to give it a good solid review. When I have that opportunity I will come back and give an update.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great for every day wear,5,"Collapsible, check. Lightweight, check. Comfortable, check. Stylish, check. this has now become one of my favorite rain coats. It is lightweight, yet you don't get cold when wearing it. At times, I barely even notice that I am wearing it. I also like that the hood folds up and stows away in the neck... without being bulky and annoying. The pockets are also huge! You have plenty of room to put gloves, a hat, and other items in there along with your hands. Just be careful what you put in there, since the pockets are webbed. This jacket permanently sits in my go bag folded into its own pocket."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Questionable Utility,3,"The zipper separated the first time I used this product.  I guess it is worth $30 to keep a mild rain or drizzle off you.  But it is really, REALLY light weight and not for heavy duty adverse weather conditions."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Muy conforme.,5,"La calidad del producto es buena. Desde un principio la compré sabiendo que es una campera para días húmedos y alguna que otra salpicadura de agua en sircuntacias como ir a pescar o caminatas. El que compré está campera pensando en que es impermeable para la lluvia está equivocado, no va a proteger de la lluvia."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Light weight, packable, good fit",5,"This is the second packable rain jacket that I have purchased.  The first was about 15 years ago.  It was my ""go to"" rain and wind jacket for travel, fishing, etc.  Served me well, but lost its water repellant properties over the year, and got a little grubby.  Glad to have found and bought another."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great packable windbreaker,5,"Great packable windbreaker.  It has no insulation, but seems to be sturdy, lightweight, durable (so far), and packs neatly into a small space.  I've used it with a fleece under jacket and that combination is very warm and windproof.  Using it with the fleece way allows flexibility for changing weather conditions.  I'm very pleased with the purchase."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,The best thing to keep me dry since in umbrella,5,I love this jacket and I would highly recommend it.  I also got it on sale so that pretty much sealed the deal.  I took it with me on a trip to Mexico City I also live in a very rainy portion of United States.  The jacket has paid off in spades and now I can’t imagine traveling without it .  It backs up very nicely and when paired with a hat it is the perfect rain protection.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Repels rain like a duck's back.,4,I am a lawn care pro and this jacket repels rain with ease.Was skeptical during the purchase due to some bad reviews but this jacket has performed flawlessly throughout recent inclement weather.My only gripe is that the hood is a little floppy...Buy this jacket with confidence.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,knock off,3,"I bought this because I lost my first one I bought from Academy. I noticed something was different but couldn't tell what until I found my lost one.  Material feels cheaper, the sleeves are suppose to have stretchy bands and the waiste tie is suppose to be adjustable from both sides not just one."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Not Waterproof,1,"I looked around for quite a while to find a ""Waterproof"" jacket.  I saw this one was made of waterproof material, and decided to try it.  Just went for a 25 minute walk in a slight drizzle to give this jacket its first real test.  I'm definitely not soaked by any means, but I did not stay any drier than if I were to have not worn the jacket at all.  When I took it off, the entire inside of the back was covered in drops of water that had seeped through.  No, it was not sweat.  This fabric is clearly not waterproof.  I've never had ANY problems with Columbia products in the past, but I was horribly unimpressed by this product.  Guess I'll have to break down and spend several hundred dollars if I want an actual waterproof jacket.  UGH."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"It's not expensive, but seems to work",4,"This is a lightweight rain jacket. With the southeast weather acting like the northwest weather, this is a handy jacket to have. I'm not outside that long, but this seems to keep me dry. If I were going to be out for longer, I would use my offshore waterproof gear."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Nice jacket,5,Well made. Does tend to run a bit large. I ordered my usual XL but had to return it for a L.I like that they have long size options. The long covers my untucked shirt tails.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Perfect for a rainy day,5,"I bought this for my boyfriend, we're going away this weekend and it's going to rain, I was looking for something light weight and that would ship quickly. This jacket is great, its packable so it is easy to bring anywhere and the fit is good. The hood is hiding under the collar so you have to pull it out, it really is a cool idea. There is enough room to wear a hoodie under it just incase it's cold which is great because the jacket isn't heavy. I think it is a fair price for a jacket like this. Probably would have been cheaper if it wasn't Columbia brand, but I bought name brand because I knew it would be good."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Excellent jacket,5,"Just what I wanted. A lightweight, water resistant windbreaker that fits well by itself or layered over a fleeced zip-up. I am short and rotund, and this jacked has the right length and a relaxed fit around my waist."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"One of Columbia's best rain jacket deals, without giving up useful features",5,"I found this rain jacket very comfortable, and except for a loose waistline, it looked great. Light-weight nylon, a useful stowaway hood, and protective zippered side pockets. This jacket was well appreciated in rainy Hilo, Hawaii..."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great travel rain gear.,5,"This is a great rain coat.I travel for a living and with todays air travel restrictions, the way you pack is everything.  This coat packs small but is durable enough to withstand frequent use in a work environment.  While it is light weight, It is a bit over sized so that you can wear a fleece underneath it ( multitasking) in cold environments like snow.  I have one for my work gear and one for my personal travel gear as well.  I also have one in my scuba diving kit for the boat ride.  In that environment all of the salt water must be washed off or the zippers will corrode shut.  That is the only down side I have found with this gear.  I have a light weight set of REI rain paints ( again a bit aver sized) to complement it and the system works great.Love this coat!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great Jacket,5,"This is a great jacket and really protects against the wind. I took this on a recent backpacking trip and was at 11,000 feet. The wind on the ridges was fierce and consistent, but with this coat, I was warm the whole time. It blocked the wind and truly performed well. The hood was slim when it is folded in its pocket and I thought the coat fit well. I would recommend this product to anyone."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Outstanding value for this jacket,5,"Exactly what I was expecting and looking for - light-weight, excellent protection from the rain, looks nice and can wear with jeans or khakis - has a hood hidden in the collar (very nice feature when that rain is pounding down) and you don't have to take off your ""rain"" jacket - it just looks like any other nice light outerwear. Best price I could find anywhere is right here on Amazon!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,I am satisfied with this jacket.,4,"The price was higher than I had figured on spending for a fairly light and simple waterproof jacket that will only be used occasionally, but I found few alternatives and took the plunge.  It looks and feels good and is a high quality well made product.  Regarding the fit, i said ""as expected"" but if I had to lean one way or the other my 3X jacket seems more likely a tad large than a tad small.  This is probably good since it may have to be put on over other clothing."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Perfect,5,I'm six feet tall and 205 lbs.  I normally wear an XL in T shirts and golf shirts but I figured a size L would work best and I was right.  I'm not planning on wearing this with a sweater underneath as I'm headed to the Caribbean with this.  Might need an XL if your planning on wearing a sweater or something.  Great jacket.  All the features you could want.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great lightweight windbreaker A+,5,"This jacket has it all. Adjustable Velcro cuffs on the sleeves, adjustable string around the waist, concealed hood in the collar. Large is just right size for 5’10” 172 pound male. I returned a medium and am pleased I did."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,It breathes,4,"I like VERY much the fact that the fabric is breathable, unlike the rubberized rain jackets I have owned in the past. My four star rating will become a five star if the water resistance lasts through a couple of washes."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Not a great choice for light rain, or longtime wearing.",2,"It was a great fit, but is sorta useless for rain. It does a great job of folding into it's pocket, but on a light rain it stops the rain, but traps any sweat or moisture against yourself, if you're doing any kind of moving I was shocked at how wet I felt underneath. In a downpour of rain you will probably stay drier, but otherwise it was a waste. Works okay as a wind break, but not excellent. I got this for a three week trip to Scotland in May/June with a bit of hiking and walking around outdoor museums."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,This is Perfect!,5,"I purchased this for a college graduate who is very small in build. It is hard trying to find things to fit him perfectly without him being present but I trusted this would be a good fit because Columbia has never let me down. Sure enough, he was very happy with his Christmas gift, commenting, it fits perfectly!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great lightweight rain jacket,5,"I’m 5-8, 155. Ordered a medium, fits well with room for a sweatshirt. Really sheds water also. Have worn it several times hiking in the rain and stayed dry. Read other reviews stating hood was too big, not at all in my opinion, just right."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great quality,5,"I purchased it for my son, who works outside.  The fit is large enough that he can wear a hoodie under it if it is cold.  I know that it is water-resistant and keeps him dry.  Reasonably priced for the great quality."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Perfect lightweight rain jacket!,5,I wanted something a bit more lightweight than my Northface soft shell - so I went with this Columbia rain jacket.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  The fit was perfect and I was able to pack it into a very tight suitcase for traveling abroad.It's become my new go-to rain jacket over my Northface due to the weight alone.  It's so much lighter and feels more flexible than my other rain jackets.I would highly recommend this (as long as you aren't looking for warmth!)
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Adequate,4,"This is a reasonable windbreaker at a reasonable price ($40). Here in Southern AZ, there is little need for waterproof jackets, but I need a layer for the winter. I do sweat a lot in it, but I did not pay Gore-Tex prices."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,How dry am I,4,"I got to tell you guys that if someone would have bought this jacket for Prince, we never would have heard purple rain. It’s like a water force field. See some rain clouds starting to sprinkle? Not today Satan, I’m rocking my Columbia jacket. I wear mine to six flags and stand at the bottom of the log ride just to flex on those jacketless fools.If you want to be dry you got to buy!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,flimsy and overpriced,1,"I ordered this expecting something durable to take on a camping trip where lots of rain was predicted. as soon as I took it out of the packaging I was afraid that I might tear it by moving too suddenly. Ended up going to Target and buying an $8 poncho, and the material that was made of was far thicker and sturdier than this flimsy jacket. instant return"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Convenient,5,The fact that you can fold it up and put it in its own pocket makes it really convenient. It's a little bit bigger than expected as far as the fit. But it also kinda thin so if it's cold you might wanna wear something thicker under it. It definitely is nice to keep in your car in case you run into some unexpected rain
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,EXCELLENT JACKET IN SO MANY WAYS! Especially people with long arms...,5,"LOVE my jacket!! Great fit. Worn several times now. Material not stiff, stayed dry in rain & SNOW.I really like that it didn’t stay wrinkled after being scrunched up in my back pack for a day.This is a classy looking jacket....especially for someone that has difficulty finding long arm length like I do."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Not breathable.,3,"Worked well enough for a 7 day trip in the Smoky Mountains. Not breathable, so sweat accumulates during hot/humid conditions. Enough of a wind breaker for cooler (50 degree) night time temperature. Arms are wide enough to slide/roll up to elbows comfortably. For the price, I think it works well, but I may look around for a more breathable, water proof jacket for hikes in the future."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Rain outside, but wet inside!",2,"While it functions as a a raincoat, it does not breathe and gets clammy on the inside. Plus the water runs off onto your pants. Columbia, in their effort to compete have dropped their quality. Need to find a better manufacturer and jacket."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,A winner!,5,I bought this for my hubby for when he walks the dogs in the wet. It fits him perfectly and keeps him dry on the wettest of days. It looks good and does what it’s supposed to do at a good price. That’s a win win win!
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Shrugged off the rain and a good windbreaker! Lightweight and packable!!,5,We were caught in a pretty continuous rain shower for a few hours and I did not get wet at all and it kept me from getting cold because it's a pretty good windbreaker too.  Very impressed because it's very light weight and packable too!
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Light weight rain jacket,5,"Like everything!  fit is exactly correct, room enough for a heavy sweater but not so big that it is sloppy, hardly know that it is on.  had another maker, zipper failed very quickly, this zipper is fastened to a fabric band that looks strong."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Big and swishy,3,"The jacket is too large all over, but moreso in the sleeves.And I learned my husband doesn't like that swishy windbreaker sound and feelAlso, why can't Amazon returns be mailed through a post office?  My UPS store is 45 miles away."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Like a duck’s ass,5,"The only thing I hate more than being cold, is being wet and cold. I know, probably shouldn’t live in New England. I can slip this guy in my man purse/ pack and I’m covered. Takes up virtually zero space and weighs zilch. It’s not gonna work for a torrential downpour or driving winds, but for normal every day rain it’s great. I’m 5’11 and 215(shush I am so) bought a large based on the reviews and it is true. They run a little large. Fits me perfectly. For some reason the Tusk color was cheapest. Looks good to me. Highly recommend. Thanks for reading"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Perfect.,5,"The jacket is great, price wise, it fits perfectly, and besides the sleeves getting a little warm because of them not being lined, everything else is perfect about the jacket. It is an IDEAL light rain jacket, if you want some does not too cumbersome and comfortable. I love the color is nice and bright."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,NOT A RAIN JACKET,1,This product DOES NOT protect against rain. I work as a UPS driver & needed something to protect me against the rain until my uniform jacket came in. Total waste. I was still completely wet while working in the rain with this jacket on.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Color Off,3,"A-ok fit, form, function but color darker than expected. This is rain resistant, can be compacted into a self contained pouch, but has enough heft to be a good windbreaker/light insulator in late spring/early fall."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Great jacket,5,"This is just what I was looking for.  It's perfect for hiking, lightweight so you don't get too hot, waterproof, packs great in luggage, pockets for phone, wallet etc."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,A rain jacket should keep you somewhat dry correct?,1,If your looking to get wet this is the rain jacket for ya. It got me soaked in light rain. The hood is a joke. It covers just enough of your head to drip all over your face. Columbia is not the company they use to be. Spray with a waterproofing spray.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Columbia with another fine product,4,"Very lightweight, plenty of pockets for you to store your personal items. Color was as advertised. Rainjacket still needs to be tested in heavy rain, but for the moment, it's exactly as advertised. More of a springtime jacket though, not ideal for warmth in my honest opinion. I wish this jacket came with it's own storage pouch like certain other colors, but regardless, it's a good jacket."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,The zippers are garbage I took it to a shop they wanted 50 bucks just to fix it .,3,This is the second one that I have bought and the zippers on these things are absolute junk they'll be the second one that's broke on me and always it happens after it's too late to return it I don't get it.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Not Waterproof,1,This was waterproof when I bought it but after a year it was no longer waterproof. In other words the seller sprayed it with waterproofing and called it waterproof. I am soaked from walking 3 miles in light rain while wearing this jacket. Don't buy this if you want true waterproof.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Nice rain coat for warm weather,4,Nice raincoat for warm weather since it's very lightweight.  I wouldn't recomend it in colder weather since it's too light weight to keep you warm.I like how the hood rolls up and goes under the collar.Reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is the sizing.  I have several Columbia jackets and always order an XL and this XL is larger than my other columbia jackets so I would recomend ordering a size smaller
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Hooded Performance Fleece Jacket,"White isnt white, look at my picture",5,Um little confused on the color? The white isnt white. More like light shade of gray. Like if you put  A glob of white in the Gray color and mix it up and that's what you get lol. Amazon you need to update actual color. It's dark blue and medium gray. Mite return it not sure. Doesnt match much with my shoes now
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Hooded Performance Fleece Jacket,My son loves this jacket,5,I bought this at TJ Maxx way cheaper but my son left it on vacation.

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Hooded Performance Fleece Jacket,Not like the picture,2,"This jacket seems well made however the color is deceiving. I purchased the red, blue and “ice” jacket- however it is not white like the picture- it is a dirty looking dull grey color. This is not a “change in computer monitor color” issue either , it is completely different."

It kept me very warm while running, which is why I ordered it.  Looks sharp and you can put the waist of the jacket where you want it because it has some elasticity at the bottom of the jacket.  I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase."

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Hooded Performance Fleece Jacket,Love but got wrong size,3,"I bought this for my man for Christmas and he loves it, it’s just the wrong size. He needs a XL Tall instead of a 2XL. The 2XL is way too wide for him."

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Hooded Performance Fleece Jacket,Bella,5,Quedo perfecta
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Hooded Performance Fleece Jacket,The small is just a little bit smaller than I wanted,5,"I don't think this runs particularly small or large, but this small is definitely smaller than the adidas fleece hoodie, I am not a big dude but it is too short for me but the width is fine.  I am 5'8/172cm around 170lbs/78kg slightly muscular.  I feel the medium wouldn't have the nice slim fit I like, this one does but if I could be a few cms longer.  As it stands I can only wear comfortable if I wear only a light undershirt.  It's definitely not going to replace one of my larger winter jackets but I love the style."

Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,No BS light jacket,5,"I've owned and worn the same Levi denim jacket for over 30 years (no, not all the time: that would be weird).  It still looks great but occasionally shrinks up (usually after Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years...) and I wanted a larger version to wear during these odd times of unexplained shrinkening (oh shut up spell check: if I make up a word, I get to decide how it's spelled) .  My wife is, even as I type, offering rather malicious theories on the unexplained shrinkening and I'm suggesting that she obviously does not know the meaning of unexplained.  I apparently have no brand loyalty as I didn't even notice I'd ordered a different jacket until I held the 2 up side by side to compare.  Meh: close enough.  No pads, zippers, epaulets, or any other unnecessary adornments.  Just a classic, clean, light jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Tough jean jacket with a roomy fit for a man who works with his hands,5,"I have worn jean jackets over the years for actual work, not fashion. Thus, I look for my jean jackets to have room in the upper back, shoulder, armpit, and chest regions so that I can freely move, unrestrained. I also look for the denim to be thick and tough so that it won't easily tear if it snags on something.I can no longer wear Levi's jean jackets because even the XXL size fits like a medium and has zero room in those regions that I listed above. I bought this Wrangler jean jacket and it is PERFECT. It has room everywhere, but isn't bulky, it's tough, the color is wonderful, it's warm, and it fits how a man's denim jacket should fit: stylish, but roomy and tough for real work. I usually wear XXL for my tops because I'm a muscular man with a broad back/chest and regular sizes don't fit and the typical companies like Levi make even their XL+ sizes super tiny. This XXL Wrangler, however, fits exactly how a XXL should and I love it.I 100% recommend this Wrangler jean jacket!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Great look, strong, comfortable",5,"Don't bother with that other brand that charges more than double for this still style jacket. If you ever owned a denim back in the day you probably had Levi or Lee. Well, take my advise. I've been everywhere and seen everything. This jacket fits perfect, sturdy, stitches are perfect. Buttons are in for life. Nothing more can be said that wasn't mentioned already. My review is if you want a denim, grab this one. The price is unbelievable. And if you think a name and more money is going to get you some better material and workmanship, your being fooled. I went that route. Sent it back on my for this one got money back! being it was 1/3 cheaper. I didn't care about money, I wanted a good denim. Jumped the gun and went top shelf. Take my word, grab a Wrangler. Came in 2 days, inside pockets, etc... Mine is blue and I noticed only a tiny bit of color run after 2 washes. Slightly shrunk but I honestly didn't notice. I bought a 2x. I'm 190, 6'1"". I wanted it slightly bulky in order to wear clothes understand underneath. My experience these were always good at keeping in the heat anyway. Don't hesitate you'll be sorry you didn't get one a month from now on the fall."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Very sturdy, wouldn't rip easily",5,"Very sturdy, wouldn't rip easily. It's warm enough for winter but wouldn't be too hot for a breezy summer day. I put patches on it and it turned out exactly how I wanted. It has six pockets. Two pockets on the chest, two pockets down by your hands, and two pockets on the inside of the coat. The pockets are all good size. I've put bottles of water in the inside pockets before and it worked great (perfect jacket to sneak snacks into a movie theater with;D)"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,great for girls too,5,"i'm a girl, and i love this jacket. i was looking for something big and spacious and i want to sew patches on it. i ordered the xl like i do nearly everything else but it was ginormous. i love that there are free returns! i reordered the medium and it fits SO well. big still but not too baggy and i can roll the sleeves up or wear them down, both look good. im very happy with this jacket!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Best Denim Jacket Made,5,"I've been wanting a nice denim jacket again for awhile now. I've been searching in almost every retail store in the area I live and nobody sells demin jackets no more. I had a Levi jacket years ago and it was a nice jacket. I saw these Wrangler jackets on here and read some of the reviews. So I ordered one in charcoal. When I received it I washed it right away because most denims are stiff and not very soft. When I finally put it on I was amazed how nice this jacket fit. These jackets are very well constructed and very sturdy. This is one nice jacket. It's got 2 pockets on the inside which the description fails to mention. I loved this jacket so much I ordered one in every color. Very satisfied customer, Wrangler rocked this one. I would highly recommend this jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Off color denim jacket...,3,"If you just want the blue denim ones you may don't going to have issues with the colors but I choose the 'Moss' and the first I ordered arrived with a stain and the color wasn't even close to the picture. The second jacket arrived in two days thanks to Amazon great customer services, but the color again was very different from the 'Moss' color in the picture, so I give up trying. Quality and fit are good but it's a shame that they can't produce a consistent and or accurate color.  I do believe that the picture is a misrepresentation of the 'Moss' jacket color. On the attached picture the jacket on top was the very first jacket (not showing the nasty stain) and the one at the bottom is the replacement."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Quality construction, comfortable, dependable, American. Look no further for a great jean jacket.",5,"My third one in about 17 years. I've handed down the first two to my children who continue to wear them. The fit is very comfortable but stylish. It's a no-nonsense jacket that does what it is meant to do. You can pay more for upmarket brands that look virtually the same but you don't need to. I wear it often in my convertible in the spring and fall and just chuck it in the washing machine when it starts to smell like exhaust. It has protected my arms from welding sparks (though it's not a safety garment, just saying) and my back from Kato-like sneak attacks by the Golden Retriever. In none of the 3 jackets I've owned over the years have I discovered any defects in manufacture, any substandard quality in buttons, denim, or stitching, or any issues with fit. They break in easy and provide years of comfort. I'm 5'8"", 180lbs and an XL is perfect for me because I often wear it over pullovers in the fall or on my motorcycle. If you aren't going to wear it even partially-buttoned or seated, someone my size might prefer a large."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"6' 1"" tall and 310lbs = 3XL",5,"I just received this jacket today and am very, very impressed.  I was stuck between whether to get 2XL or 3XL and the latter is perfect.  I carry most of my weight in my gut and this fits completely fine when buttoned.  Generally, arm lengths are too short on me but these are perfect.  I included a picture of the inside pocket since someone had asked in a previous comment.  You can compare the height and width of the pocket to the buttons and get an idea of how big it is.  Material appears rugged and ready for wear.  From previous feedback, I have cold washed it to get the initial dye out and will update this comment if anything significant changes after the wash.  I can't believe that I was able to find a denim jacket this good for this price!!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,You cannot ask for a better denim jacket,5,"My previous denim jackets have been Levi (my gut outgrew them) and I had no idea what to expect from a Wrangler. I wear their jeans and like them a lot so I had high hopes for their jacket. I was not disappointment!The fit was actually much better than I expected. Rarely do off-the-rack clothes fit me very well. Usually if the chest and shoulders fit comfortably then the sleeves will be too long or if the gut fits then the shoulders are loose. Not so with this jacket - it is tailored for a real person.The quality is very good; nice weight denim with solid seams. Some of the button holes are almost too tight, requiring a bit of effort to open, but I prefer the button holes start out tight/stiff and then loosen over time rather than start out easy and get sloppy as the denim softens.The denim is fairly stiff brand new but a couple of washings with fabric softener and some wear is softening it up nicely.I have already sewn a couple of patches to the jacket and will be painting the back soon. I have no doubt I will get many years use out of this jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Exactly what I was looking for,5,When I say some what large I mean I was deciding on xl or 2xl (because so many things come small to size). I wanted it a little big for layering under this is just right. I love this jacket it’s a little heavier than I thought but it’s very warm for a unlined jacket. It’s is made just like ones I bought 30 years ago very rare in this world. I would greatly recommend this jacket to anyone who is looking for a good jean jacket.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Awesome jacket!,5,"LOVE this jacket! A little stiff at first like most denim clothing, but after one wash is perfectly comfortable! Wore it on a recent trip to Colorado and it was really warm with enough room to wear a flannel shirt beneath it. I’m 5’9, 165 pounds and the large was a great fit and length. Definitely recommend."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Awesome Denim Jacket,5,"Was very surprised on the weight and construction of this jacket.I'm writing the review to help others who are facing the dellema of choosing a Denim Jacket .I read reviews on all of them. Especially the Levi's. Trust me, this is a qualityproduct and the price was excellent. I tried on the Levi's locally. It was very very tight, and the next size was a bit better, but the sleeves were to long.... what to do? I read all the reviews and figure I'd give this one a try. So far, not dossapointed, and I believe one washing will make it a taiilored fit . It's heavy, I mean noticeably heave, and works well with either a tee or a hoodie or sweat shirt. Overall, I'm really pleased and my wife wants one! For the price, she'll get one. Great to be casual and layer accordingly. Never usually totally dissatisfied with any Amazon product they promote.You couldn't give me a Levi's jacket now ( well you could give me one)  but for the price and quality, I wouldn't buy one ."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great Denim Jacket...Here's What You Are Buying,5,"This Wrangler jacket exceeded our expectations. The first thing you notice is the weight.  It really is made with heavy duty 100% cotton denim.  The stitching is well done.  It's a handsome demim jacket.  Although it's made in Bangladesh, it's good quality and expected to last a reasonable time.After trying an item on to make sure it fits properly and there are no defects, I always wash clothes before wearing them.  Instructions are wash in cold water/dry on low setting/iron if needed.  Be sure to wash this alone the first time unless you have a pair of faded blue jeans you want to add a little more color to.  Just like their blue denim jeans, the blue dye does run during the first two washings so the wash water will be VERY blue the first time around. I took the jacket out of the dryer immediately so there were no wrinkles and no need to iron.  Looked great. The sleeve length did shrink about half an inch which we were expecting.  I suspect there might be another half inch shrinkage over time.There are two front breast pockets which are wide enough to get your hand in. Compared to a Levi denim jacket hubby has, these two pockets are just a little larger.  He says these pockets are nicer for a man's hand....not too big but not so small you can't use them.  There are also two outside side pockets (my husband calls them handwarmers) and two inside side pockets.  The inside side pockets are a good size and deep so I think you could fit most anything in them that a guy would carry around in his jacket. My husband likes the fact that you can fit a business size envelope in them without worry that they'll fall out."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Perfect!,5,"I honestly never do reviews, but this jacket is just absolutely amazing where I have to write one.I am a woman with the height of 5'2 and weight of 200 pounds, I got the size X-Large, it fits perfectly as a over sized jacket, I'm currently putting patches on it and they stay on very well.It's perfect for all weathers, I live in Texas where we get all four seasons in one day.I really do enjoy it!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great price for this jacket,5,"Nicer than I thought it was going to be. Heavy enough for chilly weather and will work great with a hoodie for colder days. Well put together with lots of pockets, inside and out. Gave it two hot, large washes and hot dry. No color change or shrinkage. The washes really softened it up. Washing instructions say not to wash it the way I did but I rarely follow instructions. I just knew I wanted it softened up and took the chance. Worked great, no problems. I have to believe this jacket is going to wear well. I am 5'6'', 165lbs with a barrel chest and stomach. I got the large and it fits great, if that helps you with sizing. If you are looking for a jean jacket, this one is nice. Especially for the price."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Sturdy jacket for putting patches on,4,"For reference I'm a 5'8"" 185 pound female and ordered a size large. The jacket is alot heavier and thicker than I thought but that is probably good. I wanted a sort of oversized look so I went with a large. I haven't washed it and it fits enough to be buttoned with some room, except around my hips it's sort of tight there but I have wide hips so that's not the jackets fault. The sleeves are pretty big, alot bigger than I expected, but taper and fit close around the wrist. The sleeves are also long enough to cover most of my hand so you can wear them normally or roll the sleeves up a little and they will still cover your arms fully. All in all I bought this wanting a slightly oversized sturdy jacket that I could put patches on and I am pretty happy with this purchase. I will update this review if anything changes after washing it."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Amazing jacket. Ladies size down!,5,"I am a girl and I bought this denim jacket because women's styles tend to be too tight, too thin, and too short. I wanted a roomier, more durable piece. I'm 5'4"" and 135 lbs and I bought the Medium size because there was only one (ugly) color option for the Small size, and I figured that the Medium would shrink considerably from washing and drying in hot water. It did shrink a bit after two rounds, but this jacket is still feels ENORMOUS on me. There is more than enough room to wear thick sweaters under it. I definitely would have be better off with a Small. The more I wear it, though, the more I dig the roomy style—I'm sure this will become one of my staple jackets in the fall.The material is super heavy--I can tell this jacket is going to last me many years, and I am excited to see how many different styles I can squeeze out of it. A huge positive is that I can fit my keys, wallet, and phone in just one of the pockets—something that would be impossible with a women's denim jacket. I gave this jacket 5 stars because the size issue was my own fault, and beyond that the make, color, and general style of the jacket are awesome."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Really like it, though color is off",4,"I was concerned about the color before purchasing. The photo on Amazon looks rather tan with brass buttons but the color name is Moss, which sounds green. I took a chance and ordered it anyway because it was a good price. Turned out, the color is very different from this webpage. I still really like it. Indoors the color appears light grey. Outdoors it still looks grayish but there's a definite green tone. Wrangler's website has a more accurate picture, which I plan to include with my review.I wanted something that I could wear with blue jeans without looking like I was wearing a denim suit. For that, the color contrast is great.I was also concerned about the fit. For me, on most denim jackets the sleeves are too short and the fit around the body is too tight. This jacket is a good fit for me in Large Tall. I'm 6'-1"", 200 lbs. The sleeve length is perfect and the overall fit is just right for being able to layer a fleece underneath if needed. The material is pretty thick and heavy. This makes the buttons kind of a tight fit. I'm sure this will loosen up over time.I've only had this jacket a little over a week but I find myself reaching for it first when going outside."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Seriously Excellent Denim Jacket,5,"At last!  A denim jacket that fits just right!I throw this beast on the floor when I come home and put it on the next morning.  I have not had to wash it nor iron it in four months (during a moderate Texas summer).The best value for the money among denim jackets that I have ever seen, and I've worn 'em all."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,and you'll be fine.,4,"I normally wear an XL size jacket. A lot of reviews stated the jacket fit was big, so I ordered a L. Wrong move. I think the fit is standard. Get what you normally get with any jacket. I'm 6'1 195, the L was right on but no extra room for a hooded sweatshirt. The sleeves were spot on to, but with 1-2 washings would be above the wrist. Just get your normal size, and you'll be fine."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Nice jacket!,5,"This is a solid jean jacket.  I too was always a Levi fan, but their jacket's are not what they used to be (I had them in the 80's, early 90's).  Wrangler still makes a nice thick, durable jacket.  And with the savings you can buy a second one and still pay what you would for one Levi jacket.  It fits slightly big on me (XL for 5'11"" 200# guy) but that is how I prefer it.  The breast and inside pockets could be a bit bigger, but they were still large enough to carry a phone and/or wallet.  I would buy this again."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Can't Go Wrong,4,"This is Wrangler's ""Urban"" version of their denim jacket. Why ? You won't get the Western Style seams on this one and the overall design is made to look more fashionable than workwear related. I own a few Wrangler jeans jackets and they are top notch. The ones made in Mexico use better denim IMO. This one is made in Bangladesh and for some reason I can always tell when something is made in Bangladesh. It has a certain look to it. Anyways the denim used for this jacket is softer but still has a nice thickness to it compared to other companies that try to pass polyester as denim these days. I am 5' 10"" 1/2 220 lbs and a XXL is perfect on me.  Not my favorite Wrangler I own since I prefer the heavy duty workwear line like Riggs etc. but this one has a unique rinse to it which I don't already own. I am sure it will go nicely with some dressier clothes that I have. Can't Go Wrong. Wrangler still makes decent stuff...amazing in this day and age."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Think Out of the Box....Perfection!!!!,5,"OK...I'm 6'4"" 250 lbs Lbs....I challenge anyone to do as much research as I did to find a Cut-Off Jean Jacket for Riding.It Ain't gonna happen.I tried thinking out of the box and thought...HMMMM My last Cutoff Jean Jacket Circa 1983 was a Wrangler and now sits Proudly on my Wall as a Keepsake.I will probably Shadowbox it eventually.It's never been washed except for all the Rain Storms I Rode through.I lived in Florida for 35 Years so it actually has been washed..Just by Mother Nature.I read all the reviews on this Jacket and how they run Big so I ordered a 2XL and Low and behold it was too big.SO...I cut the sleeves off..Washed it and dried it on High heat.Guess what...It fits ""PERFECT""!!!!  I'm 70 lbs heavier than I was in 1983 so it's nice to have an Old friend Back.I know it's made in Bangladesh but I don't think I own ""One"" thing Harley that's made in the USA.I used to have a Big Problem with all this outsourcing but if they don't make it here what are you supposed to do? I just ordered a pair of Wrangler Jeans hoping for the same results.I was a Big Levi guy but the chaffing is relentless.Hope this helps other Buyers...PEACE and Happy Riding."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great fit,3,"I bought this for my nephew.  Specs:  5' 8"".  175 lbs., 43 inch chest, 36 inch waist, arms 34 inches.Size purchased was extra large.There is room to wear a sweatshirt underneath.  The jacket is not a tight fit and allows room to move.  The jacket comes down to the beltline as expected.  Sleeve length...sleeves fall about an inch below the wrist.Sizing is really good.  Good fit.I removed 2 stars for being outsourced to Bangladesh - grossly overpriced considering where it is made.  Bangladesh production should have this priced at $20 US retail.US made would have given it 5 stars."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,AMAZON #1,5,Great jacket strong denim great snap buttons stitching and a great price! Here in 3 days! No need to buy a size up perfect 2xl fit! Thanks amazon you rock! Realjohn Mendocino Coast
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Perfect fit!,5,"I bought this as a fathers day gift for my husband. He has wanted one for a long time. I saw this and by reviews I ordered it. He was so very happy!! He is 5'5"" 180 pounds and has a bit of a belly which is what I was worryed about but still plenty of room and not restricting, I bought a large and it fit him perfectly. It falls at his upper thigh, it wasnt tightin the waist, chest or arms and sleeves are great not riding up when reaching. It is so soft and has that been wearing for years look and feel to it, it isnt stiff at all. The buttons are a little hard to button or unbutton but is normal once it has been worn a while they will loosen and be easier. Cant say enough about this wonderful quality product and the price is an extra bonus!! I would highly recommend :) :)"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Nice jacket, but charcoal color stinks horribly. Stick to the other colors.",3,"Nice jacket. Looks good. My only problem is the odor. Others who've complained about the stench of the black dye are correct.So five stars drops to three.I've never lingered outside the open door of Satan's bathroom on the morning after taco night, but after wearing this jacket for a while I can imagine the miasma.It's better after a few weeks, several washings, through rinse after being submerged overnight in a five gallon bucket of water, more washings, and a week hanging outside in the wind, rain, and sun. The jacket is wearable now, and folks upwind of me hardly wrinkle their noses any more, but I still can't stand the stink if I try to leave it draped over the back of my office chair.I have these jackets in indigo, moss, and charcoal. Only the charcoal is stinky."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"great relaxed fit, but not for slim-style folks",3,"It's a perfectly nice jacket, very comfortable fit. It's just a bit large for my taste. I wear things very snug and slim (not TIGHT like skinny jeans or anything, but definitely a more slim, tailored look), and this jacket was just a bit ""roomy"" for the size I selected. That being said, everything else about it is fantastic, and I highly recommend for anyone who wears things in a bit more relaxed fit."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Beats Levi's!,4,"I had also purchased a levi trucker (Bangladesh made.) from Amazon. I was disappointed with the Levi's because the sleeves were too tight. Could not even fit one sweat shirt underneath. My usual size too. Formerly, the Levi's Trucker had beautiful baggy sleeves for an excellent layering piece. And my regular size was right. Well, not anymore. The Wrangler wins currently in my book. More room for layering, more honestly sized to accurately sized fit. And not twenty thousand ""Different"" color combinations to confuse the buyer into making the wrong choice twice. I like to match my tops and bottoms with exactly the same dye color lot. It would be amazing if the jackets and pants were made in the same nation in my opinion."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Really Good General Purpose Denim Jacket,5,"The fit is perfect -- which is not so easy for me with jackets.I am average height with a slim/athletic build.I weigh approx 175 lb with a 43 inch chest.I currently have a size large jacket of another brand that I purchased several years agoIt is comfortable, but I rarely wear it because its too baggy in the mid-section -- plenty of room for a sweater, etc.I decided to go with the medium and am glad I did.The sleeve length is perfect -- any shorter would be too short.The sleeves are a good width -- you'd have to have huge arms to feel restricted.The jacket fits nicely across the shoulders.The waist hangs straight.It was unexpectedly cold one morning and I was able to wear a hoodie underneath without any real problem -- I would not have wanted to drive a car for a long period of time like that, but for a short period of time it was fine.The material is comfortable.Its not HEAVY duty, but it is good denim that will make a decent jacket to wear while doing physical labor like cutting wood, etc.All-in-all, I give it 5-stars because I really cannot find any faults with it.Its an especially good deal for under $37.00."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great  Men's jacket.,5,"I own several jackets of different colors.  This Wrangler Men's denim unlined jacket is great.  The charcoal color is a real nice color for a man.  I own a couple of the jean blues, both in a darker blue and lighter lined jacket, but this charcoal is very nice.  At first disappointed that Amazon stated the color in my size Medium was unavailable, and not sure if or when it might return.  Had it on my watch list, but no response.  By accident I received a ""Recommended for you"" ad on my email with the jacket I wanted.  It showed only 2 left.  By the time I signed into my Amazon account there was only one left. This jacket goes extremely quick..Glad I own one now.  Plan to wear it often."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Perfect in every way!,5,"Got the jacket yesterday and first thing I did was try it on. The size chart is correct in every way and the jacket fits perfect in every respect. I am 202 pounds (can't seem to get under 200? Must be the beer?), 38 inch waist and 3 in the sleeve. Could not have ask anything more from Wrangler. Almost order another one a few buck cheaper but then looked at the ""shipping weight"" which was almost half of this jacket. Yup that mean cheap material (in the one I almost ordered. This is quality stuff that looks great, feels great and for a bonus has two ""inside"" large pockets for a cell phone or light lunch! OK maybe not ""lunch. Thanks Amazon and Wrangler."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,The only flaw I have found with this jacket.,4,I'm 6'0 and around 180 lbs. I have a muscular build so I decided to go with a medium. This jacket is phenomenal except for the loose sleeves. They seem to have more room in them than would be expected. This isn't a total deal breaker and the jacket still looks great so I really can't complain!
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Fits perfectly!,5,"USE your size chart accordingly!Measure everything!WASH as instructed to ensure your clothes won't fade and will fit afterwards as well.NOTE: if you use 1/4 cup salt and 1/2 vinegar when washing denim for the FIRST time, it will set the die.USE warm water, cold rinse."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Good fit and easy to move and work in,5,Great fit really nice jacket I’ve been looking for another one since the collar of my other wore out I really like the 2 inside pockets you can put your phone and stuff in and they don’t fall out every time you bend over. I’ve been looking for some of these jackets for a couple of years now these are great they have large shoulders and a narrower waste it’s not that bad some reviews said they had to unbutton the bottom to set down I can’t see why the jacket comes to your belt so if you don’t have to take off your belt the jacket should be fine.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Good Buy on Real Nice Jacket,4,"I have been buying the heavyweight denim Wrangler blue jeans for several years. They fit me better than the other brands, so that's a plus, but they wear longer and feel substantial.When I noticed this jacket on Amazon, and for such a reasonable price, I wanted one. Especially when I saw I could order ""tall"". I'm 6'-2"", 210lbs, 34 waist and the LT fits really well. The length of the arms is perfect and the bottom of the jacket hangs about 2"" below my beltline. There is room for a sweatshirt underneath, too. The fabric is the same as I've come to expect from their jeans, thick and cozy."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Heavy duty, perfect fit, great inside pockets!",5,"I bought XL-T (tall). I was replacing a Carhart denim jacket that got too big for me (lost weight!). I didn't like the small chest pockets on that style, so went with this Wrangler item instead. I wear Wrangler jeans, so I figured why not match the jacket? I'm very glad I did. Large inside pockets were not mentioned anywhere in the seller's description, or anywhere else I could find. But, they are there! The outer chest pockets are large enough for my phone, too. The hand warmer pockets are perfect. A great fit, definitley longer than the regular style."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Hard to remove sulfur smell.,3,"Ordered two of these coats, after the first wash I noticed a sulfur smell coming from both.  Rewashed separately, same.  Again with different detergent.  same.  Used smell removing detergent for workout clothes.  same.  hung outside for a couple of weeks.  Same.  Eventually got the smell out using a mix of orange degreaser and bleach.  Never had this problem with clothing before.  Wonder if something in the cloth or dye didn't get properly handled when it was made."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Chest Pocket Flaps Too Large,1,"This Wrangler Unlined Jacket is an exact replica of the long-gone Lee® Ridge Rider denim jacket. It has the same vertical front seams and attention to detail. The two, wide, inside pockets are the best thing since sliced-bread. The denim is heavy-weight and this jacket will age the way it should. HOWEVER, DUE TO ""COMMITTEE DESIGN"", SOMEONE ON THE TEAM GOT THESE TOO LARGE CHEST POCKET FLAPS PAST INSPECTION. THE FLAPS ARE LARGER THAN WHAT THE ADVERTISEMENT PRESENTS. I HAD TO HAVE MY CHEST POCKET FLAPS REDUCED IN SIZE BY 1/4"" BY OUR TALENTED SEAMSTRESS. YOU WON;T BE HAPPY WITH THE POCKET FLAPS. TOO BAD, WRANGLER ALMOST PERFECTED THE EXTINCT LEE® RIDGE RIDER.P.S. THIS JACKET FITS GREAT!. LONGER SLEEVES AND A SLIGHTLY LONGER TRUNK MAKE THIS JACKET ONE YOU WILL NOT WANT TO TAKE OFF. EXCEPT FOR THE FUNKY POCKET FLAPS. YOU DECIDE."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Fit Perfectly - Better than expected!,5,"i was nervous to purchase a jean jacket without trying it on first, but i tried my luck with this one and was very pleased in the end!I had looked through the reviews in hopes of seeing how it fit someone with my body type, but was unable to.I normally wear XL in shirts and jackets, but in my experience of trying on jean jackets the XL's never felt right. I have pretty broad shoulders. i decided to order the XXL for that reason, and because i wanted to be able to wear sweatshirts or thicker shirts underneath without the jacket feeling ""tight"".The XXL feet perfect right out of the box, but even better after i washed it one time. (it helped with the initial stiffness)If your sizes are similar to mine - i'd recommend the XXLMale - 5'6 - 245lbs"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Rugged Comfort,4,"I am 6'4"" with about a 42 inch waste and the 2 XT fits me very well.The length in the sleeves is perfect.I would have preferred the jacket to be about an inch longer, but that is just my own personal sense of style.  The jacket doesn't ride up too high when I bend over or anything like that.And I am very pleased with the quality and design of this jacket overall.  The seams are tight, the pockets are deep enough, and the buttons are rugged.  So I expect this jacket to last me a long time even with all the travel I do."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Size and fit,5,"I am a 5 foot 8 inch male. My dress shirt size is 16.5 inch neck with 32 inch sleeves. My blazer size is 41 inch shoulder regular, and my jeans size is 33 inch waist. I have bought two recent coats/jackets, one rain coat and the other a 9 month winter/fall jacket, and both of those were mediums, and fit perfectly. For this Wrangler Jean Jacket, I had both the large and medium sizes sent to me. I tried on the large first, and it fit perfectly in the sleeve, shoulders and length, with a bit of room to allow for a layer (sweater or hoodie) in the shoulder and chest. The medium size was notably too small in the sleeve and shoulder with just a tee shirt on. My experience is to order a size larger than you usually wear. Otherwise, the Large Jacket seems exactly what I wanted."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,My denim jacket is a 2x Tall,5,"This jacket fits my boyfriend perfectly. He has lots of room to move around and not feel constricted. He liked the jacket so much that he had me order him another one exactly like it  just to wear at work. The denim is rugged, yet it is soft and comfortable and looks nice whether out and about or at work. He likes that it does not end at the waist and ends at mid thigh. He says that it is just like the jacket he loved in his wild ? twenties! Peg for Bill who is in his seventies!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Really high quality and fits great,5,"This was a pleasant surprise.  My son actually bought it to wear at work and not only did it look great, the quality is terrific.  Nice and sturdy.  It fits great and is versatile.  Bottom line- excellent quality...it’s a mans man jacket!  He ordered a medium and it exceeded his expectations!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,This version also fits better in the sleeves,5,"The worn out wrangler jacket this replaces has only 2 chest pockets and sleeves that are too short. This much improved version has two chest pockets, two side hand warmer, and two large inside pockets. This version also fits better in the sleeves. You can put your arms straight out in front of you and the sleeves don't hit half way between the wrist and elbow. This is a real advancement for those of us that actually ride horses, bicycles and motorcycles. It is roomy enough that I can wear a sweater or hooded sweat shirt under it."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Nice jacket ruined by smell,2,"The smell of the dark colour denim is absolutely horrible. Smells like sulfur and gasoline and yes, I've tried everything: airing it out, many washes, white vinegar, baking soda, smell-reduction products. Nothing gets the smell of brimstone out of this thing. It's really a tragedy because otherwise I love the jacket but I'll have to get rid of it."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"not bad for the price, but oddly proprotioned",4,"I almost sent it back, but the price makes is worth keeping.  The fit is odd.  The shoulders are snug, and I can barely fit my hands through the wrist holes, but the belly area is loose, making this not a tall jacket, but a big-belly/tall jacket.  It wouldn't fit a big/tall man, as the shoulders and wrists would be far too small.  You need to be built like a pear for this to fir perfectly. That said, the denim is decent and, at this price, it's worth taking it to a local tailor or someone to take in the extra material on the sides."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Nice denim material and styling,4,"Nice denim material and styling. I intend to wear it with just a tee shirt, and on occasion a long sleeve shirt. Fits okay with the tee, but is somewhat tight with the long sleeve shirt. I'm 5'7"" and 170 lbs., and it fits okay, especially unbuttoned. I can't button the neck collar button though and the second button from the top pulls kind of tight across the chest. I have a slight, middle age belly, not a beer belly by any means, and it fits okay with the buttons buttoned. I would say though this is sized between a slim fit and regular fit if that makes sense. I you have a large chest or big belly, it will fit like a skinny jean jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Sizing difficult,3,"I'm 6'4, 210 lbs.  Usually wear an XL, not an XLT.  However, here, the Wrangler XL was too short in both the waist and arms (I wear 36"" sleeve) and the XLT was just overall too large, in body, sleeve length, waist, etc.  So, I've returned both and ordered another brand.  I would recommend checking the size chart re sleeve length, etc., on these jean jackets, as they do vary a lot from one brand to another."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Very nice jacket,5,"This is a great jacket. The color and size I wanted wasn't available so I got a bigger size, and it's honestly too big, heh. I washed it once, going to throw it in a dryer and see if I can shrink it down a little.But that doesn't take away anything from the jacket. So far it seems to be a very good quality jacket, good seams, lots of stitching, nice heavy denim material. I am very satisfied with the quality of the jacket material and manufacturing."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Finally, a long enough denim jacket!",5,"As far as denim jackets are concerned, I've always had a hard time getting one that would be long enough to suit my tastes, without being bulky and square fitting. This one is a little big in the mid section, but the length is there. Knowing that it'll shrink (basing on my experience with other denim jacket in the past), this one can made to fit better after a couple washes. If it'll help, I wear large in Dickies work shirt/ Levis denim shirt, and I got this in XL long. There is plenty of room for layering, even after shrinkage in the wash. If you want a more fitted look, large long will probably still be plenty big."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,This jacket is roomier and more generous in the arm and shoulder than Levi,5,"This is by far the best denim jacket you can buy at any price. It looks better than Levi or Lee in its color and stitching(I bought antique indigo) and it has room. This is not one of those cheap cut, too-small-looking prettyboy jackets.This one is made for action and work not posturing at Starbuck's. So I highly recommend this and a sweater can comfortably be worn under this without feeling tight. I have no problem recommending this to anyone with normaltaste in western wear."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Awesome Jean Jacket!,5,"I'm hard to fit, with a 52"" Chest and 36"" Waist, standing 5'-10""...I bought the XXL Regular Fit, and it fit nearly perfectly!Great Jacket design, as well!!! Pockets are where they should be, and buttons easily!Would buy again, but won't need to, unless someone steals it, as it should last me 30 years... I'll be 86 by then!!!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Near perfect . . .,5,"Jacket fits the bill. Fabric is VERY rugged. Should last forever. Lol. For a 72 year old guy, I would have preferred a softer, maybe lighter fabric, bit I'm not seriously complaining. Got a 35"" waist.  Let's see what a few washings do; should make it perfect."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Color looks good and consistent,5,"This jacket exceed my expectations. The fit was spot on (6'2"", 275 lbs. Bought the 2x jacket.) Denim is heavier than jeans material. It's quite stiff upon arrival, but is starting to loosen up after a few weeks of wear. Color looks good and consistent. Pockets are all pretty small. The lowers are just big enough to put my hands into. Interior should be big enough to carry gloves, a smart phone/tablet, or a slim concealed carry piece. Hopefully it will last as long as the jacket that this one replaced."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,The BEST Casual Jacket to Own and Wear.,5,"This denim jacket fits and wears Just like your most comfortable jeans.  Easy to put on and wears so good even in my truck. My wife says I look Soooo Good in that Wrangler Jacket !  I can’t add to that.  Why would you pay more for a jacket that wears GreAt, looks Great And Feels Great !"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great Jean Jacket,5,"I am a larger woman so I ordered a 5X, and if fits great with extra room to move! I am under 300lbs and I would say a 5X is roomy and goes to my mid thigh when I wear it. It's s thick and sturdy made jacket. It isn't too hot and will make a good jacket for spring or fall. It's kinda heavy but it's also very attractive."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Wrangler Rugged Wear Denim Jacket good product,5,"I previously owned a Levis Lined Denim Jacket with Red Plaid lining.Had the thing for I would say 15 to 20 years and it was great until about 3 years ago when it started to come apart. I wore it every winter to shovel snow because a heavier jacket was too much.So I go looking for a Denim Jacket with Flannel lining and they are impossible to find.If you get a levis one the lining is hot pink and it is acid washed... Who Wears That?well not me or your average adult male.I then saw a number of businesses offering flannel lined denim jackets but all of them said the denim was cheap and I had a chance to hit a local tractor supply store to verify they were correct.I have been wearing Wanglers and Rustlers for a long time now and although they don't last like levis useto do .. levis today are not what they were when I was a kid.. buy one pair of jeans 2 sizes too big and it would last you and then you could hand them down.I am happy Wrangler still serves the heterosexual male who needs something to keep warm while we are out shoveling snow so the Females and the ""ladies"" don't have to get their shoes wet in the snow.MAKE ONE WITH A LINING FOR UNDER $50 PLEASE!I was also surprised to see there are Two inside pockets ... I will match this with a hooded swett jacket and it should last for a while.Thanks again Wrangler.Was shipped from Amazon not a third party... lots of people commenting about third parties so I added this."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Real nice - Heavy Jacket,5,"Bought this for my husband for his birthday and he just loves it!It's very nice. I got the Antique Indigo and it is nice looking. Not too dark but not all faded looking. It fits him great. He's 5' 8"" and 160 and I got him Large and it fits just right. Highly recommend this Jean Jacket!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Highly recommended. Would buy again. 3X is a perfect fit.,5,"I bought a 4X Wrangler jacket and it was HUGE. I returned it and got a 3X Tall Levi's jacket and it was too small. Then I found the ""Goldilocks size"" that's just right. 3X. It's not a tall but the sleeve length is about as long as most tall sizes. I can put my arms straight out in front of me and my wrists are still covered. I never had a regular length jacket or shirt do that before. This will be my ATV riding jacket since I lost the other one.The label said Bangladesh, not made in Mexico like the ad said. I looked it over and didn't see any defects. One button was hard to fasten but the hole looked like it was cut all the way open. All I did was button and unbutton it about 10 times and it works like it should. When I tried on both Wrangler jackets I was wearing a T-shirt and my forearms itched until I washed them. I always have to wash my clothes before I wear them anyway, so I washed the jacket twice. It still fits, the color looks great, and whatever was on it that made me itch is gone.I like this jacket a lot better than Levi's stretchy denim. Instead of 100% cotton, it's 98% cotton and 2% spandex. You can't treat that the same way you would a pair of jeans when you wash it. My denim jackets always smell smoky when I come home from camping, and they don't get any special treatment when I wash them. All of my clothes are colored and go in the washer unsorted. My jackets get washed separately but at the same temperature, warm, not cold. You don't have to follow the label instructions since it's plain old cotton. Not only do I like the Wrangler jacket a lot better, it cost about $35 less than the overpriced Levi's."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"So far, I couldn't have asked for a better jacket",4,"Good quality jacket, though I haven't had much opportunity to actually wear it as of yet.... temps here have been below freezing in recent days and as nice as this jacket is, it just wouldn't be able to handle those temps. I made this purchase more as a spring / fall jacket as prior to this, I had either a nylon windbreaker or a huge leather coat (neither of which ""fit the bill""). Anyway, I'm rather tall, 6'5"" and about 235 lbs so finding a jacket (any style) can be a little difficult. The length of my arms normally surpasses the length of the jacket sleeves. I ordered the 2X Tall and the jacket fits perfectly. I have only washed this jacket once, but after the wash found that it was still a perfect fit. As spring approaches, the leather coat will be put back in the closet and this one will be moved to the coat rack for daily wear... then the real tests will begin. Should there be any problems, I'll update this review."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Everything I hoped for in a denim jacket!,5,"Growing up and for several years as a young Navy sailor and even later, ""Jeans"" jackets were my favorite ""casual"" wear. After retiring from the USN and getting into my later years, I also added extra pounds at a slow but consistant rate. (Ahem) After far too many pounds it became impossible to find a ""jeans"" jacket that 1) fit, and 2) didn't make me look like a giant bowling ball in denim.(Second ""ahem"" here)Since June of 2012 I have dropped 68 pounds (and continue to lose, and yes I am bragging a bit!) and rewarded myself with a ""Jeans Jacket"" that actually fit and is comfortable and most certainly is ""all that.""Ladies and Gentlemen, boyz and gurlz, I rate this garment 6 stars, the extra star for my extreme satisfaction with this jacket. Since I can only wear one at a time (hmm. Maybe if I . . . ohnevermind), I only purchased one. In addition to which I have another 50 pounds to go so I will need even smaller sizes. I have no hesitation whatsover in recommending this jacket. Six stars from the grumpster! ******When I finally reach my target weight, lookout Amazon!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,It smelled really bad,1,"When I received this jacket, the first thing I noticed was that it smelled terrible. It had this really strong musty smell you would expect clothes which have been in the family attic for a few years to have.The jacket looked pretty good so I was thinking I would just have to wash it 1 or 2 times to get the smell off. Unfortunately, I underestimated how much this smell has seeped into the jacket's fibers. After 4 wash cycles, 2 nights in a freezer, multiple sprays of different types of anti-fungal and anti-odor chemicals, and full days under sunlight, the stench still remains.I am now, with much sadness, considering just throwing away the jacket along with my respect for Wrangler as a company."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Ordered a xl, got a large by mistake, great!",5,"I had ordered an xl bc there wasn’t a size chart, and I prefer some room. I’m 6’1” and 200#. I got a large by mistake and I am very happy that I did. I have a 41” chest and ~40” waist and the large fits just right. I’m about average build, not too skinny, not too broad."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,An affordable denim jacket from my favorite jeans maker! :),4,"Good jacket and exactly want I wanted for my intended use. The fit seems to run larger than normal. I wear an XL in everything from undershirts, dress shirts, aloha shirts, jackets, coats . . . this jacket is loose. I am 6'2"" and 216 lbs and I had to snap the waist straps to their tightest position to prevent flapping while riding my motorcycle. I love the hand pockets, nice place to stash my gloves when I am not riding."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Perfect,5,"This jacket is one of my best purchases on Amazon. I purchased a 2X Tall vintage indigo. If are a tall person this is the jacket you need to order. I'm 6' 4"" around 265 lbs. This jacket exceeded my expectations. There are inside pockets that I wasn't aware of that is perfect to carry my iphone.  I'm extremely pleased!!!!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great jean jacket,5,I am a “big guy” and have difficulty finding clothing that fits properly. This works well! Love it
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Fits nicely after washing in hot water and drying in a hot dryer,4,I’m about 6 feet tall 175 lbs and I’m sually between a medium and large so I got the large knowing that it will shrink.  Tried it on when it arrived and it was a bit large so I washed it in hot water with white vinegar to prevent running of the dye then dried it on hi heat in the dryer and it did shrink however it was still a bit loose so I rewashed and dried. The jacket now fits nicely with a t-shirt.I bought the indigo color and it looks really nice and there are inside pockets that are large enough for most smartphones
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Wrangler is the real deal.,5,"I just received this review and its funny that I just finished washing & ironing my jacket. Reviews are so misleading I often wonder why some people bother to write them at all. This jacket received so many mix reviews that I blocked them all out. I placed my order as comfidently as I would of  been buying this jacket in a store. I ordered the color of my choice and my regular size (medium) with wrangler you get what you pay for. "" Quality ""  And as I had mentioned earlier that I had just finished washing & ironing my jacket,well the color never faded and the size remained the same, no shrinkage."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Awesome Wrangler Denim Jacket,5,"I bought this jacket for my 16 year old and he wore it today and he thinks it is awesome. It is well made and definitely Rugged Wear. It is straight, and what I mean by that is that it is cut right. None of the different sections twist or roll and it washed up great and dryed even better. Everything lays flat like it is supposed to and I am actually shocked to get such a nice coat for $29.99. The material is good denim, thick and held its color well when I washed it...and I washed it around 4 times to break it in a bit for my son. It is dark blue, like a new denim article of clothing should be. I prefer to wear my clothes out myself rather than have them be worn out when they arrive or I buy them in the store. For me there is nothing like looking at a pair of jeans or a jean coat that I have worn out myself and all those memories from wearing the item around in life's travels shows in every thing about it.I highly recommend this jacket to anyone who wants a very nice jean jacket to add to your wardrobe. It will be one of those items that you own forever and if you get a bit on the thick side you can pass it on to someone you love that is a bit slimmer.I bought a XLtall and it is great on my 6 foot tall son who weighs around 180#. It didn't shrink much after washing and drying."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Perfect denim jacket for me,5,"Perfect denim jacket for me. I'm 6'2"" and overweight. Take a 3XL in shirts because I like a looser fit. I ordered the 3XL jacket and it fits perfectly. Sleeve length is spot on. Not too big. Not tight. Fits perfectly. Very well made jacket. Glad I bought it and would buy again or recommend to anyone looking for a high quality denim jacket that doesn't cost $80, $100! Looks and feels as if it'll wear for many years to come. Very happy I bought this jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,I really like the jacket but it's larger than I expected/liked,2,"I ordered (and reviewed) this jacket in X-Large regular length about 6 years ago [when it was $36]. I really liked the jacket but it was shorter than I expected/liked.  Somebody stole it a couple of weeks ago, so I ordered the ""tall"" version earlier this week.  The tall is not only longer it has longer sleeves it's larger in the waist causing it to billow/blouse out in the back, and the sleeves come half way over my hands.  So, I'm returning it, and ordering the one I got before hoping they haven't just changed the waist size or arm length"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Everything I hoped for,5,"I live in a large metropolitan area and was unable to find a Wrangler denim jacket in any major department store so turned to Amazon not really expecting to find one.  This jacket is everything I hoped it would be ie, heavyweight denim, perfect fit, inside pockets, strong seams and brass buttons. Not sure of your size? Amazons “try before you buy” solves that problem. I ordered medium, large and extra large so I could select the fit I wanted. And return shipping is free. I strongly recommend this jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,just enough room to wear on top of other clothes so layering is easy. Looks great,5,"I'm about 5'10"" at about 230lbs with about a 53-54"" chest, the XXL fit perfectly, just enough room to wear on top of other clothes so layering is easy.Looks great. I lived in one of this jackets during high school and found them to be a great flight jacket when I was going thru flight training. Now 40 years later and way heavier still feels great and looks great on me. Glad to have found one thing that the quality has not changed. Buying some for my kids."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Exactly what I was looking for.,5,"The reviews of this jacket were dead-on. I wanted it because it is almost never cold enough in NW Georgia for me to need a heavy coat and I am constantly having to take my coats off in order to be comfortable. I decided to find a denim jacket like I had as a teenager in the desert southwest. I looked for Levi's like I had back then and found their current selections to be junk that is designed for the hip-hop crowd who buy for looks and not function. The Wranglers jacket is very well made, with denim thick enough to be sturdy and last while being soft enough to wear comfortably. The inside pockets are large enough to slip my 7 inch tablet in but that might be just because I wear an extra large.I can't find anything that I don't like about this jacket and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and lightweight jacket like they remember from their youth.As for ordering from Amazon, as always, it arrived earlier than expected. The more I shop with them, the more I want to for the things that aren't absolutely necessary to have right away."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,My favorite jacket.,5,"I love this jacket and ordered a new one after losing my old one after 25 years of use. The new one looks just the same as the old one, just not as worn and still stiff from not being broken in. I wear a hoodie or flannel inside as a liner in winter and keep a small pocket poncho in one of the inside pockets for rain and still have enough pockets for everything I need to get me through a day of working outside or whatever."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Nice jacket, check the size chart!!!!",5,"My husband has the XXL ""Tall"" in Antique Indigo. It's ""longer"" than it looks on the picture. He's tall, and thin. It's a few inches past his waist, and he's able to wear his ""belted leather waist pouch"" over it. Better known as a (fanny pack). 😊 Very nice denim ""Wrangler"" jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Good but phew,4,"I'm knocking off a star cause it DOES smell bad.But.... It's my knock around outside jacket and it's warm and to be honest the smell eased up after I wore it out in the cold a few times.I washed the stupid thing at least a dozen times in vinegar, baking soda, a pretty good dose of bleach once, Dawn, cat shampoo, carpet cleaner, and anything else I could think of"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket In Black,4,"I purchased this jean jacket in size 2XL for my husband. He was pleasantly suprised that the sleeves fit his arm length correctly (he's 6'2) and that the chest fit true to size (he's about 235lbs). He also liked that there are two pockets inside the jacket (one on each side). Even though it's unlined, the denim still has a good heft to it. The only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is the dye of the denim. It's technically black, but almost a faded color. I expected it to be a darker dye job like the picture. All in all a really good buy, particularly considering the price (I paid $32.99)."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,DISGUSTING Chemical Smell,1,"This jacket absolutely STINKS. I wish I could describe the smell, but what I will tell you is that it rubbed off on so many of my shirts in my closet and made everything smell SO BAD. Washing them once had no effect and I had to launder them three times to get the smell out - yay, I pay for my laundromat and this was a real inconvenience. I have never smelled anything so bad in clothing that is supposed to be new. DISGUSTING. I returned it immediately. This should not be for sale on Amazon."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Fake Description,1,"I'm so disappointed, and returning this immediately. The description states everywhere that it's 100% cotton, which is why I purchased it. The tag on the jacket says 100% polyester. If you don't mind what the jacket is made of, then it's not the worst, but I wanted actual denim."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Not For Me,3,"Returned it because the fit was just not for me. The neck, chest, and body length were fine, but the waist was about 8 inches too big, and the sleeves went about 3 inches past my fingertips. Either I am a mutant or this jacket was made for one, I asked the wife and she would not comment. Quality, and finish were both nice though, a shame I couldn't wear it. Based on part of it fitting and part of it not, I was afraid to try another size."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Good,5,"I love this jacket. I’m a woman, 5”5 200 lbs., and this fits well."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Comfortable, Nice Looking, and Well-Made",4,"It's been many years since I've worn a jean jacket. In fact, I believe the last time I owned one was when I was a high school student over twenty years ago! When I received some birthday money this year, I decided to try to recapture my youth and purchase a Wrangler Rugged Wear jacket from Amazon.com. I so very glad that I did!The denim is definitely rugged, but also just worn enough to feel soft and comfortable. The construction of the jacket is tough enough to stand up to daily bumps, yet it still wears well and looks broken in right away.The jacket itself is a bit shorter than I remember it being, but over-all I am VERY satisfied with his product!As for recapturing my youth, I'm not sure the jacket achieved that minor miracle. But when I slip it on, sometimes I feel the cool breezes of 1991 blowing through my car window.  Tom Petty crackles out of the radio singing Free Fallin' and it's all good again.Enjoy this jacket!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Right on the Money,5,"I've owned denim jackets most of my life.  I really don't like the pimped out modern attempts to ""modernize"" this old reliable staple accessory.  A good denim jacket needs to be a ""plain Jane"", understated, comfortable, not too thick, not too thin, tough, and durable piece of Americana.  Wearing this thing is like having an old friend back.  Thanks!  I love this jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Quality Wrangler Denim Jacket,5,"I'm a male, 6'-3"" , 250 pounds,  and ordered the 2XL Tall. 100% Cotton heavy fabric. Washed twice in cold water, through it in the dryer, and it fits perfect. Jacket sits just below my waist, and doesn't look too short on me. Not much shrinkege, and just seemed to tighten up a little for that washed comfortable look. This Wrangler jacket seems to be a higher quality than others I have had or looked at. Perfect jacket to wear with jeans and cowboy boots. I recommend this product."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Awesome.........,5,"I'm old, this is perfect in every sense. What goes around comes around. Its trendy, but me, just my style. Grew up in these, will be buried in one 😆😆"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,The best,5,Wrangler makes the best denim jackets. I have owned many major brands and Wrangler lasts longer and wears more comfortably. I just retired my 1970s Wrangler jacket and bought a new one. I will keep my old one for the memories and make new memories with the new one. lol
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great Jacket for a Great Price!,5,"The jacket arrived promptly and looked and fit superbly right out of the box.  I am about 6'2, but thin for my height so fit was quite important.  In the body it fits well and not too loosely.  There is enough room for me to wear a hoody underneath the jacket.  Sleeves are just right, ending right between the wrist bone and the wrist.  If it shrinks after the first wash, it could be a little short, but moving to a large jacket for wrist length would have resulted in a poor fit around the body.  The color of the jacket (antique indigo) is just about perfect, not too light as the pre-washed jackets that are factory rather than user faded.  It is also not too dark, meaning it won't take forever to get that nicely age-faded look.  I have worn the jacket several times already.  It's versatile enough to wear with casual clothing and even with a slightly dressier casual.  Altogether, I am very pleased with the jacket and when I factor in the price (about $37) I am elated.  What a no-brainer!  Great, rugged quality, superb fit, stylish look, and a super price!  What more can one ask for in a denim jacket?!?"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Perfect jacket for picky husband!!!,5,"My husband; who thinks he is special, says this jacket is: 'perfect'. Wow! He even said the fit is 'perfect'. I just about fell over because he is so particular. In fact, this wasn't the first jean jacket I bought on line, I had to send back the first one that had kind of a cooler brand name than the tried and true Wrangler Rugged Wear label.  That other jacket didn't fit well at all, the sleeves were much too tight, and the denim wasn't of a weight that would stand up to a mans useage.  This Wrangler jacket is a really nice color, already broke in, as the title implies, vintage.  Another asset of the jacket is the cut across the lower back, it fits nicely, doesn't stick out at the waist as his old jean jackets did.  Thanks Wrangler for a favorable price too, almost half of the jacket I perceived as the 'cooler' brand.  And thank you Amazon for coming through for us, there are no jean jackets in the stores this year, so I saved the day by shopping on line, my favorite pasttime..."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,What a blast from the past!!!,5,Men...if you're looking for sometime to remind you of days gone by...like that relentless pursuit of the most beautiful young lady that you ever saw...that College degree that kept you up all day and night...or those long expeditions that introduce you to something new...all that while wearing a rugged denim jacket...one that you taught could never be replaced...hey...I was wrong...24 years ago I became an avid fan of Wranglers...I fell in love with their denim collection...every jeans I wear have the Wrangler logo on it. The first denim jacket I bought was a Wrangler...I fell in love with that jacket immediately...no matter how cold it got...that jacket was all I need...it went well with everything I wore...but I lost it 4 years ago to a hurricane...never thought I would see it again or replace with any thing close to it...until now...thank you Wrangler!!!..what a blast from the pass...the right color...that real denim feel and it fits like a glove...wow!!!...what a feeling...I guess at Wrangler the more things change the more it remains the same...and I love that about Wrangler...if you need to replace your worn out good friend...thanks to Wrangler...you can replace it with this one...you wont regret it...but you will love it...trust me...you will!!!
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Not made in Mexico as described,3,"The jacket is a nice heavy cotton denim. However, it was not made in Mexico as the description stated when I ordered but instead was made in  Bangladesh. Amazon used to be better about providing correct Country of Origin information.  We kept it since my husband needed the jacket immediately to wear while helping a relative with some outdoor chores. If not for that error, I would have rated it 4 stars."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,good fit and feel,5,"wasn't expecting significant fade. Fits well for me @ 6' 2"" @255 lbs. I am taller than most off rack stuff and the arms are about 1 to 2 "" longer than most so fits great. Enough room in chest and waist to wear a hoodie under while all buttons buttoned. Does not look like a stuffed pork sausage with the buttons about to pop with a hoodie under.would buy again."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Neat Denim Jacket,5,"After searching all possible stores in our town for a faded blue Denim jacket, I did not locate a single one that was what I had in mind. Of the few Denim jackets that I did find locally, they were all the wrong shade of blue or I didn't like the styles.I was really surprised that there was not a single store in our town that sells a Denim jacket like I had in mind to purchase..I found what appeared to be exactly what I was looking for on Amazon.  I was a bit leery about buying it without trying it on but I went ahead and ordered one.My jacket came two days later and it was exactly what I had in mind. I was thrilled.When my wife saw the jacket, she also loved it and she made me order one for her that very same day.The jacket is well made, constructed of heavy blue denim and it is the exact shade of blue I was searching forSince the freezing winter weather in our area has now passed, we both wear our Denim jackets everywhere we go.."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Stitching was unsatisfactory,2,I loved my first Wrangler jacket I bought and that was given 5 stars!  This is now 2 stars for my second buy because although it looks and feels like my previous one the stitching seemed a little off.  As if someone stitched it together in 5 minutes.  Not sure what happened with the QA control team within the span of just one year but that is really despicable!  I really trusted in this brand before but now I’m quite skeptical about it.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Love It,5,"I'm 5' 9"", wear dress shirt 32/33 sleeve length, weigh around 165 and this jacket fits perfectly. I was a little worried about ordering the medium because sometimes the sleeves are a little too short in that size for me but this is just right. I probably will not wash & dry it since people have mentioned how it shrinks but I've never had a need to wash a jacket anyway. The denim is heavy enough to keep you warm but can still be worn casually inside and you won't look like you're walking around all bundled u pbecause it just looks cool."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Great jacket, I ordered the wrong size.",5,"This jacket has nice heavy denim!  I was trying to decide between the medium and large.  I bought the medium and need a large.  I am short and just a bit stocky.  I need a large, but the sleeves will be long....Will try again with a large."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Wrangler Denim Jacket  X - Large,5,"Fits very good , go to Wrangler's website to see how to get your  proper sizing measurements . Just as the jackets always have been quality material , stitching metal brass butts , and fitment . A little stiff but that's natural for denim , a few weeks of wearing and a wash or two or will soften right up . The price was right , the delivery was fast . I ordered the vintage indigo for that worn look great color ."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Nice Jacket,5,"Good denim jacket.  The one I received was the same color as pictured, so I'm not sure about the color variation that others have received.The color is a muted light brown, and works well with boots and jeans.Solid Wrangler quality and comfort, good denim weight, and nice trim and stitching.I'm 6'-1"" tall and about 190 lbs and the Large Tall was a good fit.As with any denim product, be careful of long hot machine drying, unless you're trying to shrink it down.I usually hang dry it, and then give it a very few minutes in a low heat dryer to ""soften"" it up."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great jacket for all occasions,5,"Whether it's cold or mild, this is great to wear. It's rugged and has several useful pockets. If it's cold you can easily wear it over a thinner second layer such as a hoody or sleeveless flannel jacket. It is heavy to pack so carry it onto the plane with you ( stuff the pockets with allowable stuff ) and you won't need a blanket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,just a great jacket!,5,"I've been wearing denim jackets since I was a teen in the 60s. Some jerk stole my Levi's denim off of a park bench in Williamsburg, so I moved to the country and looked for a replacement jacket. I always liked Wrangler's stuff, a habit I picked up in Durango CO. So I ordered one of these. This is the BEST DENIM JACKET I have ever owned. The material is soft, but sturdy, it hangs down just below the belt line, more than Levi's. Cool inside pockets without the annoying holes, and the color....man I just dig the color. I love it, and say ""buy one with confidence"". For the price you can't beat it."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Fits like a glove,5,"This jacket is my all time favorite if I could I would model this jacket for FREE. Its a great jacket and looks amazing, way sturdier and tough compared to Levis that wears away in a two washes. Only issue is this jacket is not built for the cold, its a nice jacket to wear a sweater under or add-ons like that, but if you wear it alone it's still nice. Definitely built for California weather where we don't get to much cold."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Solid simple jacket,5,"so i ordered this jacket for a series of new battlestar items i wanted to put on a jacket but i didn't want to put holes in my leather A-2 cause i liked the jacket too much. I have done this with jackets in the past and since i needed to replace my other denim jacket. So as to the jacket it looked good before but when i stuck the BSG gear on it it looked awesome. I used the correct placement, to those of you looking for correct information the viper fighter patch goes on the right the gold crest (Gold for officer black for enlisted) is on the left and the wings go on the right. My only issue is the angled down seam on the chest but thats a minor issue. Overall its going to be great for spring plus in pittsburgh our weather can shift quickly. I like to have a nice mix of outer wear. one day it can be 20 and snowing and the next day it can be 60. All the same i like it one very nice jacket"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,I expect the jacket will last awhile.,5,"Denim is heavier/denser than I had envisioned, looks good, slight burnt canvas smell even after two washes.  The inner pockets (formed by the lining of the outer pockets) are also better constructed than similar jackets.  These inner pockets (2) are large enough to carry ""trade"" style paperbacks, common cell phones...  I purchased this jacket to replace one that I'd used for Concealed Carry, however, although there is plenty of room for a small frame, the geometry of the inner pockets makes it less than ideal."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,long search for a jacket is OVER,5,after months of looking for the right fit jacket a friend finally sent me this link. i was looking for more of a baggy boyfriend grunge kind of fit jacket and got this in a LARGE and it’s absolutely perfect! with a clean slate i’ve ordered a couple patches to slap on there too. it was cool enough for a brisk night on the river in july but also afford the capability to layer underneath if sized right!!
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,MY BEST JACKET,5,"As a reference, I'm 5'9"" & 190, with a 44"" chest and 36"" waist (obviously, I'm not gonna fit one of those hipstery Slim Fit Trucker Jackets any time soon).I have purchased denim jackets from (yes) Levi's, Lee's, Old Navy, and Carhartt, all in L, all this year, and this Wrangler in M (thanks to the reviews here, I got the correct size). This Wrangler came out on top.  It not only had the thickest material (at least to my hands) of the other jackets I've owned, it also offered the most unrestricted range of motion for burly guys like me, with a fit that was quite flattering as well.  It was also lower-priced than the Levi's by a long shot (I paid $78 for the L Rigid Blue Trucker Jacket at a Levi's store in NYC) and Carhartt (I forgot how much I paid at a well known place in NYC).OK, so it doesn't have that certain snobby cachet, nor does it have that cardboard-like denim, of the Japanese selvedge jacket from the GAP or the rigid blue TJ at Levi's, but it's already pre-shrunken (my Levi's rigid blue XL turned into something between an L and an M after I laundered it...), comfortable, and lets you move your arms, whether you are holding onto the horizontal pole on the NYC subway hurtling around a curve, lifting 55 lb buckets of drywall compound onto the back of a van, moving plywood onto a flatbed, or one of many other activities involving actual physical work that (ahem) ""slim-fitters"" do not/cannot/deign not to, do.  The only other denim jacket that came close to having nearly this same freedom of motion was - to my surprise - the ON in L, but its material is lighter and it's made for warmer weather.  I'll save up and get several more of the Wranglers (including 1 in L to allow for a hoodie in the winter) before the weather gets too warm.Wrangler - thank you for a nice product.  Now how about a black denim jacket, or a chore coat in any color, for us city dwellers?"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Go Wrangler.,5,"I was looking for another denim jacket and the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this jacket got my attention. I'd gotten another brand denim jacket a couple of years ago. From what it used to be the material now is noticeably thinner, had silver buttons rather than brass and though it was an x large it fit more like a large.Enter Wrangler. The jacket looks similar to what the other brand jacket used to look like. A big plus already. The color was also darker and more uniform with a noticeably heavier denim material. There are more than the usual options for sizes. Jacket arrived quickly and fits nicely."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Just buy it!,5,"After trying on a size that was too big i returned it and got something smaller and wow. I was blown away from the comfiness. After 5 years of wearing my levi it was just starting to tear up, so i  decided to take a chance with WRANGLER, and i dont regret it. I loved this jacket overall."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Better than I had expected!,5,"I've been shopping for a denim jacket like the ones I wore when I was much younger, but they were all priced like designer labels. I wanted a comfortable, light weight, durable, cotton jacket for the mild Texas fall and winter, and for riding my motorcycle. This fits the bill, perfectly. The color is like a new pair of pre-washed jeans, but it still looks casual; I expect it to fade very nicely over the next few years. My clothes vary between L and XL, but the L that I ordered is plenty big for a sweatshirt beneath it - I think an XL would have been much too large for me. Regarding the interior ""pockets""... they don't seem to have been intended as pockets, but are the back-sides of the front jacket breast pockets. They do work nicely for larger items - phone, wallet, etc...This is a nice price on my new favorite jacket. Get one!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Color not as dark as I would have liked.,3,"In years past I owned a black denim jacket.  I bought this one because I liked the look of the dark jacket with a pair of black denim jeans.  I recently bought a pair of Wrangler shadow black jeans.  Very nice!  The jacket however was not shadow black.  It was not particularly uniform black, more black-ish.  Much orange stitching lessens the effect - would have been better with black stitching.  As a black denim jacket goes, the fit was OK but the look was so-so."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Classic jeans jacket,4,"Sturdy, comfortable, not overly warm, good for layering. The chest pockets are too tight to be really useful, and are more decorative than functional, but the other pockets are good. Jacket also has a distinct whiff of sulphur from the dyeing processes (black/gray) which should fade with time and washing. All pretty much as expected for this type of jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,GREAT FOR GIRLS TOO,4,"im a 16 year old girl, 120 pounds, and 5’7. ive been wanting a denim jacket for quite some time, but all the womens jackets are tight fitting and are not thick. i wanted mine to be thick, 100% cotton and durable, i also wanted it to be a bit over sized. i ended up getting a large in mens in the color vintage indigo. I LOVE IT! so glad i got the large, it fits just like i wanted. love the inside pockets, and i like that sleeves are a bit long. only cons are that the color is a bit lighter in person, and i have a dark skin tone which tends to make me lean towards dark washes. the jacket came pretty boxy, but it will wear out as i wear it more often. definitely recommend this jacket!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,GOOD TO GO,5,"I don't say this often, but this denim jacket is just what I wanted. It fits perfectly, the material is sturdy, and it has two outside pockets along with two large inner pockets. The sleeve length is perfect and the waist hits at my hip. Love this jacket!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Wrangler is great quality. Reliable.,5,"I’ve appreciated Wrangler quality for decades.Their jackets are equal or-IMO-better than the SF Bay Area company that’s lost its way.Perfect fit, as expected. Great quality denim n construction.This jacket can last a lifetime."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Jeans Jackets For The Win!!!,5,"I love my Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket!It's a funny thing. Denim Jackets (more commonly known as Jeans Jackets) were very popular in the 80s and throughout the 90s, and yet at the time I bought this one, you simply could not find a store of *any* description selling them, for men or women. Major retailers, outlet stores, upscale fashion stores... nobody... and I mean nobody... had them. So, behold the joy of the Amazon Marketplace! :-)This jacket was well-priced, and while I can only wear it during the winter months here in Florida, I wouldn't trade it for the world.I'd definitely do business with this seller again."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Simply a great product,5,"So glad I got this jacket again.it's my favorite. I bought the same one 3 years ago, and it had seen better days. It's put up with everything from being in the snow to working under the car and never complained. Bought a 2xl, fit is real good ( 6' 235 lbs.)"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Perfect fit for my size.,5,"I bought the Large. I think it's only helpful to comment on a good fit if you give your actual size. I'm 6'2"" with a 42-44"" chest and 36"" waist. Arms are about 34"" This is a perfect fit. If I only wash it in cool water and warm dry, it should still be fine because the sleeves could still lose half an inch and be a good fit. I love this jacket. Classic cowboy. Wrangler is gradually replacing all things Levi in my closet. Best fit of any brand out there. Jeans especially."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Blue jean jackets are cool.,5,"Have not washed yet. It seems a little bit bigger than the last one I got, but it may have started out  the same way. Plus I am loosing some weight, ... apparently in my arm length??  But the color, seams, pockets, buttons all look great. Beats having to go to the outlet store and getting factory rejects for just a couple bucks off that's for sure. Delivery was on time and bundled with other stuff so I could save on shipping. Always have good service here. Will be buying again when the time comes."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Wrangler unlined denim jacket,5,"I have two of these jackets. I have one in charcoal gray and one in black. I'm close to 6'1"", have somewhat broad shoulders and weigh around 195 pounds. I got the gray jacket back in 2016 and it's still in great shape (these jackets are really durable). It's a large-tall, which is good for layering when it gets cold (I used to live in New Jersey). However, the fit is a little too roomy for mild weather (it's almost like a barn jacket). I recently got one in black that's a regular large; and it fits more like a conventional denim jacket. I already have a winter coat, so this jacket is my go-to when it's not that cold outside (I now live in Seattle). There's a little room for layering, so it could probably also handle some colder weather if necessary. They're both great jackets (people say these last decades; and I don't think that's an exaggeration). It just depends on what you need it for."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great jacket,5,"What can I say, Im a wrangler guy.  the fit and look is great,  just like their jeans, it'll need a bit of wear to 'break in' and get softer, but that's the nature of denim!  Guess I'll just need to bust a few broncs or something to soften it up."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,No bling and just a great denim jacket,5,"A really nice weight of denim, great for a nice walk on the beach or city.  I didn't want a jacket with a lot of bling so I bought a men's medium, I ama woman who is 5'2"" and weigh about 132 lbs. and usually wear a women's size 10. I don't have long arms but this jacket fits a little long on the arms but I can turn it up  and maybe can shrink it just a little by putting it in the dryer on high. Very nicely made and with good quality denim like the old days.  I bought the lighter color and looks exactly like the color on Amazon.  Amazing price and looked for a long time for this basic denim jacket like the eighties and found it."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Yep, I'm a girl but LOVE this jacket (and I bought it for myself)",5,"Although I am a female, I always find that men's jackets fit better. I am tall (5'10"") and have long arms. Most women's cuts are too small and especially if I wanted to wear anything but a t-shirt underneath. This jacket is really well made, heavy denim. It's a bit large (probably could have worn a MT) but I love it. I can roll the sleeves up a bit and when it does start to get colder, I can easily fit a sweater underneath for a layered look. All in all, a GREAT value...I looked in stores and comparable jackets from other well know manufacturers were almost double the price...."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Pretty much perfect,5,All other denim jackets I have had and tried have been cut for hipsters with twig arms. This jacket actually fits as a jacket should and allows you to be comfortable even if you have actual man proportions. Quality is as great as wrangler usually is. Both the stitching and the fabric are of good quality. Probably the best denim jacket in it's price class and certainly the best one I have had.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Good jacket; great service!,5,"I accidentally ordered a size too big, and before I could return the big one, the requested, smaller one was already en route to my door. Sturdy jacket, has chest and interior pockets, it's great to throw on if it isn't too cold out. I'm 6'2"", medium fits decently, but it's still a little big on me-perfect to throw on top of other layers! I sewed a couple dozen Iron Maiden patches on mine and can say that it's great for any metal heads who are looking to buy!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,The Best Denim Jacket,5,"I have wanted to replace my Denim Jacket for over two years but no store were I live had  them. I did find a Levi one but when I put it on it was so SLIM CUT, that even an XL was tight in the sleeves, I wear this jacket in Spring and some mild Summer days, but in the Fall I wear a Turtleneck or a sweater, so that Jacket would not work. I'm 6""1 195 LB. I saw this on Amazon and loved the shade of the Faded Blue, But what sold me on it were the many reviews that made me know that this jacket would fit. It's unlined so great when I layer it, I bought the Large Tall also based on a review and its perfect. I thank the people who did the reviews.Jazzman65"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,this lady is happy!,5,this is a heavy well tailored jacket.  not one of those flimsy fashion statement ones. this is a real working jacket. but of course I bought it as a fashion statement  (*_~) and glad I did. just know the buttonholes are tight and it will need to be washed b4 wearing as it is quite stiff and has a chemical smell which I'm sure will disappear when I was it. this jacket will last for years and has a one year guarantee. would buy again
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Nice fit for a chubby guy,4,Hard to find jackets in the big guy sizes but this one fit the bill. Fit was as expected and was available in the upper end of the XL sizes. Good to see some clothing companies helping the larger americans cover up their bellies.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Wrangler makes quality clothing.,4,Both Wrangler and Amazon deliver as advertised. This jacket is well made. I wear it in both casual and work environments. Roomy enough for layering for additional warmth in Winter. The only drawback with this particular one is that it is a bit heavy for my geographical area for late Spring and early Fall so for me it generally is a six month jacket. That may be because I purchased the XL TALL over the XL Reg. and thus the extra weight. That is the only reason albeit a weak reason that I did not give it 5 stars. I am a Wrangler fan and love the fit of  their jeans over other brands. This jacket compliments them well and I suspect under normal wear and tear it will last a decade if not longer. Highly recommend this jacket and if you are patient and use Amazon you will find it at a good value price.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Heavy Duty Jacket,5,"This Wrangler trucker style jacket is made from very heavy denim.  I like this denim material better than canvas like on Carhartt jackets.  The quality all around is 5 star, in style and function no complaints; you will not be disappointed!  I really like the side, hand warmer pockets.  Now for the fit, I'm 6'3 at 230 and buy Tall as often as I can.  This jacket in 2XLT is long, extending down to my hip bones and at times, I may roll up the cuffs. I believe a 2XL regular would have been a sufficient size for me but the Tall fits well enough that I didn't send it back."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Good jacket. A bit snug in the shoulders.,4,"Actually, I find it to be a bit snug in the shoulders. Generally I wear a Medium. But, as I often wear a sweater or a hoodie under a jeans jacket, I opted for a Large. My shoulders are quite wide for someone my size, so I don't expect miracles when finding the ""right"" size for me. The jacket fits, but, as I said, I'd rather it were a bit roomier in the shoulders. Otherwise, it's an excellent jacket. Good, thick denim, well assembled. Rugged. I expect to get quite a few years of wear from it."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Just What He Wanted !,5,I bought this jacket for my Husband after Christmas as I had bought him one for Christmas BUT the one I had bought him said it was large BUT did not fit Him like his old jacket did . It took me 3 months of trying to get the fit right from other sites and had to send them all back !!!  This One Really surprised me as It DID Fit even after I washed it & put Thru the dryer !!! Color was a little darker than he wanted But the washer took care of this. This jacket is almost the same weight as his old one so it should last him lots of years. I will come back later to buy a second one for him to wear to do outside chores in . Just Love that this jacket was cheaper than the other jackets that I had to send back!!
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,The SMELL is to much 😩,1,So damn nice looking jean jacket I got the black color. Ok the Smell. WTF.. I've washed it three times before even wearing the jacket even sprayed Forbes fabric on the damn thing nothing works I'm afraid the that SMELL will never live. So sad so so sad. So what is up with that smell it is horrible not good.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Really nice jean jacket,5,I was looking for a spring fall jacket. I started looking at the local sports clothing store and everything was in the $100.00 price range. Then I remembered 40 years ago and how I loved my jean jacket.I saw the Wrangler jean jacket and it was what I was looking for.I bought two an XL and XXL. For warmers days when I just need a short sleeve jacket I will use the XL. When it is cooler I will layer a flannel shirt so I needed the XXL. They are true to size after you wash and dry them. If you  try them on before washing you may think they are to large.I dried them on normal temp and all I had to do was iron the collar so it laid flat.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,WRANGLER DENIM JACKET -  VALENTINE'S GIFT,5,FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE: (from my male friend's perspective)  --  He Loves It !!  -  I hope it lives up to his expectations  -- DELIVERY WAS SUPER QUICK (pleasantly surprised) -- ONE DAY.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Always a good day when an online clothes purchase works out great!,5,Hubby was very happy with the qualify and price of the jacket.It washes up fine  and dried it on low cycle.It came out great and loosened up the button holes a bit.They were a bit stiff at first but were better after the wash. He got the xxl to allow for sweaters in the winter and more room  in the spring/fall. it seems to be generously cut and the sleeves were fine.Hubby is only 5-5 so clothes are usually too long for him. But it fits well all over. We got the moss color which I would describe as taupe/grey/green. Very neutral and goes with every color. Hubby will  make quite the fashion statement! :)
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Fits nice, looks great but smells funny",4,"I tried a Levi’s jacket in the same size and it was too small and tight. Going from a large to an XL with Levi’s would have made the sleeves too long. So, I tried Wrangler and it fit nice all around. I like the looks and it’s comfortable. My only complaint would be the strong denim smell that was a little more than I would have expected. It’s getting better after a wash but it’s taking awhile. Still worth it."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,The Only Denim Jacket with Two Inside Pockets,5,"Bought one size larger to accommodate for shrinkage. Glad I did. Otherwise nice fit, heavy weight denim. The inside pockets will easily accommodate smartphones. I'd buy it again easily."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great jacket. Good fit in larger sizes.,5,The jacket arrived quickly and the packaging was sufficient. I was surprised at how well the jacket fit. I ordered a 4X and the sleeves were perfect length. The jacket was high quality. I love it and would recommend to my fellow big guys.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Recently purchased,5,"Ordered XL and was nervous due to reviews. Fits great for me. 5’10”, 195+ or - 10 at any given season. I am a little long from waist to shoulder so getting good fit is a struggle. Very happy with jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Nice Jacket,5,"I'm 6'2"" tall weighting in at 325lbs and purchased the 5xl. I wish they offered a 5xlt. This jacket is a tad loose on me, but with a washing, I'm sure it'll fit perfectly. The length this just right and I'm hoping it doesn't shrink up. The material is thicker than I thought it would be, but that isn't a bad thing. I was just happy it wasn't very thin. All in all, I'm happy with this jacket!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,The real thing,5,"I never had a blue jean jacket as a kid. And now everyone's wearing designers. So at 74 I figured it's time, but it had to be the real deal, either Levi or Wrangler. I'm not disappointed. It's the original heavy fabric and design, the original shade of blue and really comfortable. I had to work the buttons a few dozen times to loosen them up - the sign of the real deal."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Good quality, good fit.",5,"I purchased a TALL size this time, it fits great. The length is much better for me, I’m 6’ & 265lbs and the XL Tall fits my chest and stomach just about right. Once it’s washed a time or two it will be perfect."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Nice coat,5,"I bought this for my dad who is short and is all belly.  I got the 3xl.  He does not like constricting coats, or coats in general so the jacket without a lining was a great option.  Fits his belly and upper arms without making him feel like he is in a straight jacket.  The arms are a tad long, but I think that is just his arms being a little short.  Nice dark color."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Just like the jacket I had in the 70’s,5,"After trying a number of other brand, this is the one I kept. Roomy but stylish fit. I’m able to wear a flannel shirt under it on cooler days. Also, very well constructed with excellent workmanship."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Very nice Jacket, but has a weird smell.",3,"The jacket is made out of nice thick denim and the fit is true to size. My biggest and only gripe with this jacket is the smell on mine. I dont remember seeing any other reviews mentioned a smell, but mine has a pungent odor out of the box. I tried washing the jacket to get ride of the smell, but it persisted. Tried spraying the jacket with febreze, but it barely even covered the smell.Very sturdy, fashionable jacket, but the smell makes it difficult to want to wear it."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,The Black Jacket Smells Fine,5,"Just in case anyone is concerned by the reviews that complain about the black denim jacket having a chemical smell that can't be removed by repeated washing, my jacket smells fine right out of the package , just like new unwashed denim."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Wrangler - Yes ; Levi - No,5,After trying on an XXL Levi truckers jacket at our local Levi outlet and finding out that I could barely button the front due to my 52 inch gut I was worried that an XXL Wrangler men's rugged wear unlined denim jacket would also be to tight.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the XXL Wrangler jacket has more room after buttoning the front without looking to large.  The Wrangler jacket also has a heavier cotton weight than the Levi truckers jacket.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Good, durable, quality Jacket",5,"I've always known Wrangler to manufacture good quality, sturdy things, and this is definitely one of them.I'm a bit lanky and I didn't want a jacket that would go above my belt, so naturally I chose a larger size, which means it was loose at the waist for me, but I just adjusted the buttons on the back, and all was good. I would definitely recommend you buy this one."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Nice jacket,4,"Was surprised how large it ran. I actually tried to shrink it in the wash. Still to big. I consider myself heavy set. I have a 42"" waist. And it's even loose in the waist. I thought they sent me a larger jacket by mistake. That being said. Just know the Xtra large seems to run a tad bigger"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,I love my black denim jacket by Wrangler,5,"I love my black denim jacket by Wrangler. I have always wanted a jeans jacket. I always thought I'd have a Levi's jacket, but in my opinion, Wrangler blue jeans have always been better quality and lasts longer, for me, anyway. So, I thought I'd go with the black denim by Wrangler. I got it to wear while riding my motorcycle, instead of the leather vest with patches. It's doing great, even in the warmer weather."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Worked out Perfectly!!,5,"Great riding jack for the cool days and evenings. With a long sleeve t-shirt and fleece the jacket works pretty good on cold days too! Though I'm 5'10 (180 cm)  I purchased the tall size so the sleeves would stay down around my wrist while riding and that worked out perfectly. The inside pockets are great for keeping things secure and accessible. If you're looking for a summer weight jacket...this isn't it! This is a 100% cotton denim jacket and commonly referred as a ""Trucker"" jacket. The jacket isn't real heavy but it's definitely not light weight."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Best jacket ever!,5,"I'm a girl, I bought this jacket back in October because it seemed like something I could wear all the time. Needless to say I wear it almost every day! This past winter I wore tons of layers and huge sweaters under this and it it never felt tight and still kept me warm. Even now when it's much warmer outside it never feels too hot. I love how it fits, women's denim jackets are usually too fitted and are never as comfortable. I also love the pockets in this jacket, they are huge and fit everything. Overall this is probably my favorite clothing purchase of the past year."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"GREAT LOOKING, FITTING JACKET!",5,This jacket is perfect! Great material. Great look. Fits very good at chest and waist. Buy it in your regular size. No need to size up. Sleeves perfect. Very pleased!
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Wrangler Jean Jacket is way to go!,5,"Looks and fits exactly as I would expect. I'm 6'2 205 36"" sleeve length. It wears a little loose, but after a few washings (100% cotton )will fit perfectly. I originally ordered XL Tall, but fit too big. XL is just right!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great fit,5,The fit and style are what I wanted. Seems like a durable work jacket. I received compliments.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great,5,"Everything I would expect from a Wrangler product.  Fits as expected.  Sturdy, looks like it will last a lifetime.  Makes me feel ten years younger."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Wrangler Men's Denim Jacket,5,"I am glad I finally ordered it after some doubts about if it would fit and look nice. I am 5""10 to 5""11 and weigh at 200 lbs and the Large fits me perfectly, very comfortably fit NOT the slim fit. Wearing this denim jacket makes me look and feel more vivid and confident. I also definitely like the low price on this high quality denim jacket as well."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Make sure you want to give it away, to replace the ones you gave away, if you can even try too!",5,"It felt like home, we both gave away our coats when we moved south but later returned big mistake by giving away all our winter clothing, will never do that again!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,great jacket,5,"bought this to replace a levi's  jacket that is about 40 years old and doesn't fit anymore. had never had a wrangler jacket before so i didn't know what to expect. this a great jacket. fits just right. bought a large. i'm 6'1 and 190 lbs. took it out of the bag, put it on and didn't want to take it off. fit is great, style is great. highly recommend it."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Nice old school denim,5,"Tried to find a made in USA replacement for my 20 year old Carhartt, but could not find a made in USA denim jacket after looking. Carhartt wanted $70 for their foreign made denim acket. Wrangler was $49 shipped. So I took a chance, and was not disappointed. Well made, and fit perfect. I'm 6'4 at 260lbs, and long arms and torso. I bought 2- One black and one blue."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,The fit is good.,5,The fit.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Not fit as expected, but pretty good anyway.",4,"It looks great but the sleeves were a little bit larger than expected but I just fold it a little bit. The length of the jacket is kind of short for me but I can live with that. Good design and material, if you like this kind of jacket just go for it."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Very nice looking jacket and well constructed.,5,This jacket fits me well in the xlt size.  I am 6’ 2” with long arms and it falls between my thumb joint and wrist. Almost too long for my height but much better than coming up to my forearm when my arm is bent. The denim is heavier weight than I thought and will be a little heavy for north Texas. It will be perfect for those colder winter days and when I travel up north.  Even with my 215 lb frame there is room for a sweater underneath it.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,XL is really big,5,"I'm 5'10"" and 230#.  Size chart indicated I'm closer to a XL than a L, so I ordered a XL.  I just swam in it.  Sent it back.  Didn't want to take a chance on a Large.  Also, this denim is real heavy.  I wanted a lightweight windbreaker type jacket for Arizona spring weather.  Other than that, the quality is top notch."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Just as I remembered,5,"Have looked on and off for an old school denim jacket just like the one stolen from my locker back in the day.  Found this and had to order.  Arrived swiftly and well packaged.  The denim is stiff, of course, as it is new, but it will be perfect after a few months of wear and four or five washings.  It has great pockets as it's styled for men, is a great length, and even the sleeves fit well with just enough extra length to slip your hands up in on days you forgot your gloves.  Lovely jacket, well worth the cost, and a few washings and hours at the barn will take care of the stiff newness.  Love it!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,What's With The One Star,5,regarding the smell? I've got five of these jackets in three different colors and I've never smelled a thing. Consider taking up cigarette smoking. That will solve your problem.
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Good quality, sturdy jacket",4,"I wanted to write this review because I have had a hard time finding my size in a denim jacket.  After reading other reviews I decided to try the Wrangler.  I am sometimes between a 2X and a 3X size.  I ordered the 2X and it fits well in the body.  In shirts, I take a 34-35 sleeves.  The sleeves on the jacket were a few inches too long.  I had to fold up the cuffs; however, I took the jacket to my local dry cleaners and they did a great job removing the cuffs, shortening the sleeves and replacing the cuffs.  It cost me about $20, but this is a very sturdy coat that I expect to have for a long time, so it was worth it to me."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Classic Denim Jacket,5,"This is what the classic denim jacket is supposed to look like. Thick, sturdy denim, solid buttons, thick-stitched, tough button holes. The denim is a little stiff when you get it, but THIS IS A GOOD THING! It gives the denim a chance to break in and fit to your body, resulting in a more comfortable and stylish looking fit after you have worn it in. The option for tall sizes is an amazing thing for us tall, skinny people. I am 6'6"" 205 lbs, and the Large Tall fits like a dream. Usually to get a jacket (or coat, shirt, etc.) with long enough sleeves I have to get one that is far too large around the gut, but no such issue here. If you don't like the denim jacket look that's fine, but if you do this is one to get."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,An ok Jacket,4,"Likes - well made, nice color, good looks.Dis likes - very stiff material, could be softer. A little snug in the chest and waist but not too bad."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,as usual a great denim jacket from wrangler,4,"as usual a great denim jacket from wrangler. I bought the big/tall version from and it is a little larger than expected after fighting with their typical xl size...  The proportions on the Big/Tall is good.The first XL I bought made it look like I was squeezing 1 lb of meat into a 1/2 lb casing too short at the waist and the arms, but too wide at the waist as well."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Kinda fine, but sleeves too short for me @ 6'4"", 220, with 37"" sleeve length in dress shirts.",3,"I like the jacket, but the sleeve length is too short. They were JUST BARELY acceptable when I tried it on. If I stretched my arms forward, they were too short.  Since I suspect they will shrink upon washing, I have to return the jacket. I'm so sad, b/c I've wanted a denim jacket that fits ever since I had one last - 30 years ago - when I was 14 years old. :( [I'm now 6'4"", strikingly handsome, 220 lbs, with a long sleeve length​ of 37""). :)"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,When I donned it for the first time it was like saying hello to an old,5,"I've been wearing denim jackets since the early 70s. While I'm not a fan of Wrangler jeans, Wrangler has always been my preferred brand of denim jacket. When a recent 40 pound weight loss made my old denim jacket more fit for tent status, I treated myself to a new one. It arrived on time. When I donned it for the first time it was like saying hello to an old, old friend. It feels and looks great and is keeping me warm on cool nights as I traipse my way through Italy as I type this. Highly recommended!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great denim jacket!!!!,5,"I had been looking for a good denim trucker jacket for awhile. The Levi’s versions I had tried on were cut to slim. This Wrangler denim jacket is PERFECT!! The size is spot on, great color, and great fit. Also, half the cost of the Levi’s. I highly recommend this jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,A great denim jacket,5,"I've had the jacket for about a week now and I have to say, at first I didn't like it. But the more I wore it the more I liked it. I was looking for a ""trendy,"" oversized, ""vintage"" denim jacket. It isn't exactly vintage obviously, nor does it really have that ""vintage"" look. It is on the bigger size, I was told the jacket looked like ""it was swallowing me"" which is a good thing lol. Anyways, I'm a male standing at about 5'11"" and about 120 pounds and I'd say a large definitely gives that oversized look; it doesn't actually feel all that big but it definitely gives off that look. It's perfect to layer with a hoodie or sweater as it's incredibly warm. It also has quite a few BIG pockets. The jacket at first was a bit ... stiff, I guess you could say. But after a few wears, I think I've broken into it. I haven't washed it yet due to other reviews saying it shrinks/loses its color a bit, I can't vouch for this, however.tl;dr:Pros:-Warm-Nice look-lots of pockets-Great for layeringCons:-A bit stiff at first"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,I LOVE DENIM,5,"I have lived in the South all my life. I have never needed a heavy coat for more than 2 weeks and that was when we went to Chicago for Christmas. I have had a number of Blue Jean/Denim jackets over the years. From Lee to Levi to Wrangler to AE, they are all about the same. I do like the fit on the Wrangler over the others, but I will have to say that the Levi seems more rugged.I caught the sleeve button on a piece of equipment and was very happy that it only sheared the metal button and not my finger. Finding a replacement is kind of a pain. Will probably go to Tandy Leather and buy a concho that fits."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Will live with my expectations, you get what you pay for!",1,"Its a regular fit jacket, around the arms its too loose. There are few defects you can spot on the jacket as marked in the pictures by me, no wonder its cheaply made in bangladesh. I hate to give anyone one star but it is what it is. And i am too lazy to return the product for an exchange. Will live with my expectations, you get what you pay for!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Good quality and nice fabric,5,"This is a very nice denim jacket.  The fabric weight is heavy enough to be warm and wind resistant but not stiff or too bulky.  The color is also nice and I also like all the pockets, which are big enough to be useful.  After a couple of washings the fabric is soft and the jacket fits as I hoped."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,What’s cooler than a Jean jacket bruh? A WRANGLER jean jacket bruh! Get your inner Dan Auerbach on,5,Sometimes when I’m wearing wrangler jeans I just need more denim like fish need water so a wrangler shirt and denim jacket come in handier than rope at a rodeo
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Wrangler delivers a great classic jean jacket look!,5,"Amazing quality. Perfect fit. We had previously ordered and returned three different sizes of Levis Bib & Tall jackets and returned them due to fit issues including one that had spandex. The Wrangler jacket delivers a classic retro jean jacket look, cool and slick, yet comfortable. Great jean color. Perfect! Huband loved it!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,This is the one to get,5,"This jacket was just what I had in mind. Sizing is pretty much dead on. I am between a medium and large after looking some weight. I ordered  large and it got a little loose so I could wear layers underneath. I may try to shrink it a 1/2 size. I am 5' 11"" and 164 lbs."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Nice jacket, but",4,"The denim jacket came as advertised, but the cuffs are very tight.  Debating whether to return or not, because of the cuffs..."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great denim jacket!,5,Awesome jacket!  Great fit.... true to size.... great price!  My husband got several compliments when he wore it to work.  Amazon is amazing.  Can't find denim jackets in stores anymore so I checked a few stores then Amazon.  I was surprised at the low price and free shipping....I ordered it about 4pm last Sunday and I expected a ten day wait...no...it arrived in TWO days!
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"The Wrangler wins, hands down!",5,"The Wramgler is perfect and at an excellent price, also!  I ordered a Levi at the same time.  It was almost too small in the arms and after a washing would probably not have fit my husband.  The Levi was almost twice as expensive and was not the best buy.  I'm so happy I ordered the Wrangler jacket; am actually ordering another one for backup!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Jacket runs true to size. Very pleased with over all fit.,5,"Order your normal size. The jacket comes to just below belt line,not tight in the chest or waist,sleeve length is a little below wrist bone."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,La calidad de la tela,1,"Talla exacta, tejido muy bueno. Me encantó pero la devolví por problemas en el cuello. Espero volver a comprarla y q llegue sin defecto alguno.IMPORTANTE!!! devolví la prenda al día sgte pero por error me cobraron el importe.Una lucha con más de un agente para el reembolso, al final lo logré pero la verdad es que me sentí muy molesto con el grandísimo error, todo fue una lucha."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Have always loved this coat.,5,"I ordered this by the model number, because my last one was over fifteen years old. this is a great coat to work in. I am a HVACR tech."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Perfect,5,"This is a great jacket for an excellent price. I’m a woman, size 10 and I bought a medium. It’s just a touch oversized which is what I wanted for a boyfriend feel. I get compliments every time I wear it, which lately has been daily. It goes with everything, I can fit layers underneath if it’s cold, just perfect. The denim is thick but not stiff and the stitching is on point."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Got an extra size up because I know this brand ...,5,Got an extra size up because I know this brand generally shrinks during first few washes. Still plenty big enough he could wear a hoodie under it if he chooses. When not he can adjust the waist with the buttons on the bottom. A hit was when he saw how big the pockets were on the inside big enough to hold things without the worry of them slipping out
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,cotton,4,"According to the size chart, I should order LG, but decided after reading a review that a person with same build ordered LG and sleeves were shortalso it is 100% cotton, figuring if I wore a long sleeve shirt LG would not fit correctly.  Ordered XL and glad I did.  Fits nicely."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Very comfortable,5,I liked the rustic feel of this jacket opposed to the small and tight ones. This one has the more comfortable coverage like the older version
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,GREAT buy!  A bit large and lenghty at the waist!,4,"My husband had been wanting a denim jacket for ages now...everything in the mall was either too overpriced, the sleeves were too short, etc.When we got this one, we ordered XL.It came VERY XL.  VERY long at the waist, longer than this photo shows for sure!The sleeves were super long enough, and it's a well-made product!He doesn't love the jacket length, and we MAY either get it altered to fit or just send it back yet.  Just not sure of which at this time."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Bought for cool days on the MC,3,"I ordered both the L and XL Tall for my 6'4"", 220 lb SO, expecting him to be somewhere in between. The large fit well in the length and sleeves, but the body and waist was enormous. Bought for cool days on the MC, this would be worthless as the oversized nature would cause him to become a kite! Unfortunately I cannot find a medium tall anywhere, so I expect to spend a fortune having this tailored."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Smell.  Makes my eyes water.  Washed 10 times still stinks.,1,"The black dye they use smells so bad it will fill a room with god awful chemical smell.  I wore it once and my eyes watered the entire time.  I have tried vinegar, oxyclean, powdered milk, etc., washed it at least 10 times.  It still smells.  Its a great jacket, the smell from the black dye is the problem.  Stay away from the black.  Black Jackets don't matter.  It smells terrible.  It will drive everyone away.  It will also ruin the clothes you wash it with."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Get a size bigger than you think you should order.,5,"The quality of the jacket is excellent.  I would suggest going one size bigger since it  is smaller than expected.  I am 6'2"" and 165 lbs and ordered a large but should have gotten X-large.  I gave it 5 stars due to the quality of the denim."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Bring Out Your Inner Cowboy,5,"This jacket is simply the best!!!A nice, vintage looking indigo color; somewhat heavy in terms of overall weight, and very solid construction.Despite it not having any lining (which I personally prefer), it does a good job of keeping the coldness at bay.This jacket is good enough to stand it's own against the legendary Levi's Trucker Jacket; but for the price I paid, you'll just be paying for the name had you gotten the Levi's Trucker.Highly recommended!!! Every man needs a good, solid, comfortable jean jacket in their wardrobe."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Great fit, nice quality.",4,"A bit larger than I would like but in cooler weather, a Large affords space for a sweater or fleece underneath."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,My new replacement jean jacket,5,"My last jean jacket was a size 40, which I can no longer button up so I decided to buy another. I'm 5'9"" and 190lbs and bought the Wrangler jacket in a Large size.  The Wrangler jean jacket I just purchased is on par with the Levi jean jacket that no longer fits. Denim weight is about the same, as is the cut. The large is a bit to large for me but I figure after a good hot wash and dry it will shrink up a bit and will be a good fit. I was pleased with the price as opposed to what Levi charges for the same style jean jacket and shipping was very fast."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,popular and handy,5,"This jacket is my ""go-to"" jacket.  What I mean by that is that, not only does it keep me warm, but it looks good.  The best part of this jacket is the two large inside pockets.  I can keep my cameras, sunglasses and any other item which might not fit or bulge out of the two outer pockets."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Great Fit,5,"Purchased for my husband who is 6' 5"" and 250 lbs. The last 2 Wrangler Jackets were2 XL as we were unable to fine anything larger here. The sleeves were too short and thewaist was too high so I decided to go to Amazon and see if they had something for Tall menand I found the perfect fit. XXL tall. Sleeves are perfect and waist is just right...he doesn'tlook like he was poured into it or look like Baby Huey and has room to spare. What's evenbetter is he loves it as much as I do....Thank you Amazon for the right fit for large tall men!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very poor Quality,1,"Jacket fits well and is comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, after one hour of minimal use on normal conditions, it is already leaking down. Its external material it seems it is made off of very poor quality material and the puff material it has started to come out. At $60 price range this would seem like a bargain, specially from a brand like Eddie Bauer, unfortunately due to its quality $60 is way too expensive. This was my first and last time for Eddie Bauer brand products. I even think that these good reviews might be a hoax, or simply, i was unlucky and got the bad quality product."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Great buy at the Amazon price, but not worth retail price",4,"This jacket is a great bargain at the price it sells for here on Amazon.The retail price is $99, but the Amazon price is $59. This jacket is worth the Amazon price, but is not worth the full retail price. Eddie Bauer does regularly offer 40% off coupons that bring the full price in line with the Amazon price. Eddie Bauer also, occasionally, has a 50% off sale which would bring the price down to $49, that would be a really good bargain.If you want a good deal, pay the Amazon price. If you are in no hurry, wait for a 50$ off sale at Eddie Bauer.Why do I think this is a good deal? This is not the best down jacket you can buy. This should really be thought of as a 'down sweater' and not a jacket. This does not have a lot of features. This has good down, but does not have the highest quality down ( 650 dfp (down fill power) vs 850 dfp or 900 dfp.  This does not have down treated with a hydrophillic process to make the down more water proof. This does not have an outer shell of some super high-tech fabric like dyneema or pertex.However, this is a really good, bargain down jacket.It has quality down. when dfp ratings started being used, 400 to 500 was the most common, ordinary, jacket fill. 650 used to be considered very 'high end'. Most of the ultra-expensive coats and jackets that Canada Goose sells use 650 dfp down. Things have changed and the high end is much higher now, but 650 dfp is still good. Ask anyone who has spent over $1,000 on a Canada Goose jacket with 650 dfp down.There are better jackets that are much more expensive, but this jacket is a good jacket for $59.If the jacket had 2 of any of the following 3 features, I think it would be worth the retail price of $99:1) A hem drawstring, instead of the elastic it has.2) A zippered chest pocket (inside or outside) for a phone.3) a double zipper on one of the pockets, so the jacket can be stored in its own pocket.This jacket lacks all of those features. They are all pretty basic. If it had any 2 of those 3, I'd class it as a $99 jacket.This is not a jacket that will get you across Antartica on a dog sled, but it will meet the needs of many people out there. I've worn this jacket in weather ranging from 0º F to 45º F. Alone, it is good down to about 32º F, if it isn't freezing rain out. Below that temperature, I usually combine it with a fleece hoody underneath this jacket.It was 24ºF today on my way to work and I wore the fleece hoody/EB cirruslite down jacket combo and was pretty warm.  If it is wet out, I'll wear this jacket under a waterproof shell. The coldest weather, and I combine the three layers: Fleece hoody, down sweater, gore-tex shell. That can take me down to the 0º F easily. I'll see if I can use that combo even lower this January. It just hasn't gotten that cold yet.Workmanship is fine. Remember this is a $59 dollar jacket. I found one hanging thread I cut off. It wasn't a loose thread, just extra. The first few days, a few of the very tiny down feathers came out near some seems. I have had this with every down jacket I have owned. The very smallest feathers fit through the larger sew holes. It happens, but it doesn't really leak down.To sum it up, it is worth the price charged here on Amazon. You can get jackets with more feartures, but they cost more. You can get jackets with better down, or better fabrics but you won't get them for $59.Jackets like the Montbell Alpine Lite, REI Magma 850 2.0, or Patagonia down sweater have more features, better fabric and better down. They retail for $209 to $229. You'll see extra features like zipper storm flaps, zippered chest pockets, fleece lined collars, water resistant down and more on these other jackets. Features that are not present on this jacket. They also cost from $140 to $170 more than this jacket does.This is a great bargain for the price, it can be a really good part of any layered winter system, and you can buy 3 or 4 of these for the price of a high end brand name lite down jacket.I've added pictures of the one loose thread, and one of the very small feathers that came out (the feather is so small it is hard to see).I've added pictures of how I layer the jacket with the fleece and the outer shell when needed.This is a good deal, has responsibly sourced down and is pretty well made. If you want more features, there are plenty of other down jackets with more features."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Somewhat cheap and not durable,1,"Within a few days of buying, white feathers started coming out of the jacket from random places and the outside material is too delicate and prone to tear for daily use. Yes, it will keep you warm till it lasts ( unfortunately for me it is a couple of weeks). In my case, friction with the backpack led to a tear."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great looking jacket but not happy with the quality!,2,"I bought this jacket for my son back in December.  We were pleasantly surprised by the style, fit and how warm it was in spite of the lightweight feel of the jacket.  This was exactly what he was looking for.  However, today I noticed there is a rip on the upper part of the jacket near the shoulder.  I’m afraid it’s going to get worse. He’s worn the jacket on and off during the last three months.  As far he knows he didn’t do anything to cause this rip.  As much as we love the jacket we are not happy with the quality.  I thought he would have at least been able to wear this jacket for the next couple of years.  Definitely not buying another Eddie Bauer jacket again.  So disappointing because I have been buying Eddie Bauer clothes for my family and I over the years and expected a good quality jacket."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Warm but thin and fragile,3,"This jacket does keep you warm and is very soft to the touch.But it's very thin and feels like it would rip if caught on anything even slightly.One of the reviewers said the inside pockets don't have any Velcro to close which makes sense because I think undoing the Velcro would rip the pocket right off.Also after about 2 or 3 weeks of light use, there are a few feathers coming out.  Don't know if this will continue or not.I do like the jacket but given the price I think they could have made it a bit sturdier.Not the level of quality I would associate with Eddie Bauer."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Light and warm,5,"I ordered the “Atlantic(Grey)” color and it’s navy blue, not grey. I still kept it because the color doesn’t matter much to me and it’s a good coat. Fits great and super light and comfy. Very warm and blocks the wind well. I’ve been comfortable in 40 degree weather and I’m sure it would be comfortable even lower if you’re active like shoveling snow."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very pleased with this as my first down jacket,5,"This is my first 'puffy' down jacket and I have been very pleased with it overall.  I live in Arizona so most people would be surprised to think we would even need a down jacket here, but this is really great for the cool mornings and evening walks around the community.  It packs down really small and even comes with a small bag for storing it, which comes in handy if you want to throw this jacket in a messenger bag or small backpack.  I love the feel of the jacket overall - it feels like you're being hugged by a nice down sleeping bag all the time.  its amazing that its not TOO hot though either - it really seems to breath well.  There are times when I've worn it around my office at work without even recalling that I was still wearing it - but its just that comfortable overall.  As a camper, I also bring this on car camping type trips for lounging around in the evenings and at meals.  Considering that the outer material is very thin I'm hesitant to wear it hiking or backpacking because I'm afraid it would easily rip.  I also avoid wearing it around a campfire as a small tinder would easily burn a hole in the jacket and I don't want to risk it getting ruined like that.  Great jacket from a trusted vendor!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,but it fits great and looks cool,4,"Arrived today and too warm to wear, but it fits great and looks cool. It's very lite and soft!  I must be careful not to get it caught on anything, material seems delicate but I guess that is to be expected with these jackets. I am very pleased with my purchase!!! BTW, I am 6 feet 195 lbs and the Large fits spot on......."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Perfect for temps 20's-50's; some quality concerns (revised),4,"I live in Minneapolis, so have some experience with long winters. I've been looking for a light jacket that was a) comfy, b) warm enough for early/late winter excursions, and c) fashionable. This is it!First, the comfort is terrific. The down is super soft and very lightweight. So light that I was highly skeptical that it'd keep me warm, but it does. Good to bunch up as a pillow on a place, too.Next, the warmth value is good due to the down used throughout the jacket. Once the temp/wind chill dips into the teens and below, it's time to break out the full coat/parka. However, for anything in the 20s-50s, this is my new go-to jacket.Lastly, the jacket really looks good with just about anything. I'll wear it with jeans and a t-shirt on the weekends or chinos and collared shirts for work and the jacket fits the occasions. Also, a note on fit: I'm 6'0"", weigh 190 lbs, and like to wear slim fit shirts for work. I originally ordered a large, but felt that the middle section hung awkwardly. I returned it for a medium, and love the size.I'm very happy with the value. Your biggest ""headache"" will be to make sure you get the right size.*Revised after 2 months of usage*I just added the photo to show where a seam is starting to unravel. I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars because of this. I still love the jacket for reasons listed above, and it's still a great buy for the price. Of course, I wish it'd hold together a bit better."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Exceeds the ""Michigan Winter"" Test",5,"I got this jacket in a Tall XL expecting it to be a comfortable walking companion for a nice, brisk Michigan Fall day. Unfortunately, Fall lasted about a minute before we were all thrust into the deep freeze: Sleet and snow and temperatures at freezing or below. This jacket exceeds what I expected. Great fit in the body and sleeves. If you dress smartly in layers, this light-weight down jacket will keep you toasty--and you'll look like a boss in it!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Product has changed - no longer real down,1,"This used to be an excellent product, but now the 'down' is not real down, instead it's mainly polyester, apparently with a small amount of feathers mixed in. The first label still fraudulently says 'down', and the German label specifically says it's 80% duck down (""Entendauen"") and 20% duck feathers, but if you look at another label on it, then you can see why this product no longer 'breathes' - it's really polyester fill, not down. This is now a fraudulent product. It used to be really comfortable, not getting too hot because made with natural materials... no more. It becomes very hot very easily, since it doesn't breathe. What a shame they turned a great product into cheap trash."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Excellent Light Down Jacket,5,This was my first purchase of a down jacket from Eddie Bauer and so far I am impressed. It is crazy soft and the lighter down fill is perfect for temps in the 30s without bulk. The jacket is very lightweight and generously cut for my wide shoulders (XL). I am extremely please and actually ordered a second jacket in a different color. You simply cannot beat the price for the quality.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very happy with down jacket.,5,No complaints especially for the price. Wasn’t a fan of the puffy jacket but I really like this one because it not a think jacket but keeps you warm. I bought it for travel to Patagonia Calafate and Ushuaia so I could pack it away in my bag and it worked great did not take up much space and kept me warm in 20F weather. I had long sleeve under and wasn’t spending hours outside but for the time I was out it worked great and use it now to go to work in the northeast. It might not work so great when it’s blistering cold but regular cold your good and it packs up really good. Happy with purchase.Oh yea the fit was really good also I have a bigger build and wide shoulders If you fit a large in like Nike and under armor the large will fit perfectly with a little cushion for layering.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"A great, light warm jacket that isn't too bulky!",5,"I bought this jacket to take to Prague, in the Czech Republic, this November. I'm a skinny guy (5'10, 150lbs) that gets cold easily, and when I saw how light the jacket was, I was pretty skeptical about its ability to keep me warm and wore a long sleeve t-shirt underneath the first day. That didn't happen again! Despite being lightweight and not overly bulky, it easily kept me warm in the Czech Republic day or night (temps mid to low 40s F), and if I was particularly active, hurriedly walking from one part of the city to another, it was occasionally on the edge of being TOO warm! Dressed in proper layers I'd be fine in this jacket down into the 20s or even the teens. In addition to the two exterior pockets, it has two spacious pockets inside that were great for storing my fleece hat, power bank, etc. Super happy with this purchase!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Good jacket, but be wary of return policy",4,"This is a good little jacket, especially if you can get it on sale. It hasn’t been super cold in California yet, but I did take it for a backpacking trip where the temperatures got down into the high 30s or low 40s. And it worked just fine. As for fit, I am 6 feet tall and 175 pounds, and originally ordered the large. It would’ve been fine to keep. But It was a little loose around the torso, and these jackets are really intended to be more body-hugging. In fact, I think they are warmer that way. So I traded it in for a medium, which was better.By the way, the Eddie Bauer return process leaves a lot to be desired. I had to pay for shipping to send it back to them. And their policy says they take up to 20 days to process a refund. So when you add up the time of mailing it back to them and how long you have to wait for a refund, it could be up to a month before you get your money back. I’m still waiting for mine. I probably wouldn’t buy  from them on here again because of that unless I knew for sure I wasn’t going to return it."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Warm, well-fitting down jacket",4,"I'm the awkward size of being a Medium Tall, so I often look wrong when I order size Medium because the sleeves often don't even reach my wrists, but look like I'm borrowing someone's big brother's jacket if I get a size Large. This Eddie Bauer jacket fits me perfectly, is very warm, and was a good price. The zippers feel a little cheap compared to those on the Land's End basic down jacket and the ones on the Amazon Essentials basic down jacket as well, but they haven't split on me yet, so I'm still pretty pleased with this purchase. The ""Eddie Bauer"" logo annoys me, but it's in dark grey on the black jacket, so not even really that noticeable. Though I am from Seattle, I have never purchased Eddie Bauer products before, but this one seems pretty good -- an excellently sized Medium Tall, easily packable down jacket to keep you warm with just a regular cotton shirt as an underlayer down into the 30s, and water resistant enough to keep you warm if caught in in a Seattle 42-degree Fahrenheit depressing drizzle.If you don't need the Tallness, I suggest going with the Amazon Essentials packable down jacket instead. The AE zippers and cuffs feel more durable, and it's a good amount cheaper, and with no annoying logo."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Great fit, packs small and really warm",5,"I purchased this jacket based on the fill, packability and size. I am 6'1"" and thin. It fits perfectly with a base layer and long sleeve underneath. I layer a rain shell on top of it. We recently hiked to 13,000 feet on top of a very windy volcano and it kept me perfectly warm. It packs down small into the separate sack provided. It is so small and lightweight I can pack it anywhere. It also compresses more once it's in the backpack. It is natural so you do have the natural smell of down. I would certainly buy it again."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Love this jacket, love the price more.",5,This is a great jacket at a super reasonable price. I will say the Atlantic is not a gray color but a blue one. I think the color is really cool. This jacket will look awesome with dark jeans. I like how it came with a small pouch that it can be stuffed into. I bought this to take on a trip and have a warm jacket that doesn't need much packing space. I think I'm going to wear it around a lot.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Eddie Bauer Lightweight Jacket, Well Done!",5,"Very nice lightweight down jacket. Fit is perfect. Not too long at just past the waist. The sleeves are right where they should be as well.As others have pointed out,  it’s not a super durable variety but that’s probably in the light shell design. And for the price, it’s a great choice. It provides a lot more warmth than I expected. Down definitely does a great job at insulating.Easy to roll up and keep in a small bag as well. Stylish and wind resistant, definitely recommend if this is what you’re looking for."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,A very nice down jacket,5,"I already owned 2 Amazon Goodthreads down jackets almost identical to this Eddie Bauer model. This jacket is lighter, warmer and less expensive than the Goodthreads I have. It is very warm, fits well and is high quality. Some reviewers have said that it is not very warm, that the down keeps coming out, etc. etc.  It's very warm for what it is. It isn't an expedition parka.  I own dozens of down products including several of the best down sleeping bags in the world. I can tell you that ALL down products will eventually leak pin feathers. It's just the nature of the beast and is not a sign defective workmanship. Oh, one more thing, the jacket absolutely does not need to be bigger in the mid section. If you are fat, it's not the jacket's fault. Someone said it was not warm enough for the Midwest. It's warm enough at 10000 feet in the Rockies in December, I don't understand why it wouldn't keep me warm in Iowa.  This is a really nice down jacket. Eddie Bauer makes some nice products."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Eddie Bauer needs to do a quality check before shipping.,2,The only reason I’m giving it a bad review is because it was shipped with the stitching coming out of the collar. Who does the quality review check on these items? Also I’m pissed that it came through Amazon but I have to pay money to ship it back to Eddie Bauer where as Amazon normally covers shipping.My friend loved that it was light weight and seem warm but the stitching was messed up.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Super Lightweight,5,"Update 12-11-19 Have to say this has become my favorite jacket of all time.  It's very warm and extremely light.Wouldn't hesitate to purchase again if something happened to my exisitng. Saw a NF jacket at a local Sporting Goods and decided to purchase a similar down jacket.  This one was less than half the price, but also in quality as expected.  Nowhere near the NF, but still a good jacket.  I purchased with Discover points so it ended up being $32 which was well worth it.  Plenty warm at 30 degrees and the Large fit me perfectly.  What I like most is its super lightweight.  It’s like you’re not wearing a jacket.  I’m happy with the purchase."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great Value!,5,This is not a high end jacket.  I knew that when I ordered it.  It is very basic warmth in a light weight jacket.  I like the fit and feel of the jacket a lot!  It will work great for layering when it get really cold or stand alone for regular cold.  I put it on and walked out to 28 degree temps.  I was throwing a frisbee for my dog (light activity) and the jacket was very comfortable.  I think it is rated at 40 for low activity and -10 at moderate activity.  I like the gray color and the design too.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Down Clumps after Washing,2,"Product fit was great.  Trouble came when the jacket was washed...  all the down clumped.  Followed washing directions exactly, and unfortunately the jacket is pretty much useless now.  Unfortunately, the wash came after Amazon's 30-day return window had closed.  I have tried to deal with the company (Eddie Bauer) directly --- but have had no success.  This turned out to be a $60.00 waste of money.  Would not buy again."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Fits very nicely, very comfortable & warm",5,"I really like the fit of this jacket, it's almost like wearing a long-sleeved shirt. I have an athletic build and enjoy that the coat does not poof out at the midsection like some oddly shaped sail. It's warm and very comfortable, goes nicely under a hoodie or a rain jacket, if needed. It's also very packable; it goes nicely into one of my small waterproof bags for hiking and backpacking adventures.If the color were a little less abysmal, I'd try to give it a 6-star rating. Only the ""green"" one was left in my size of XL Tall. I had to keep it; the fit is so nice and it's very warm!I wear it almost every day despite the color so it must be awesome."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very good coat for the price,5,"I don’t like wearing big, bulky, heavy jackets. This one is super light, so you don’t realize you’re wearing it. It folds up into nothing and packs in a bag without any appreciable weight.You’re probably not going to survive in the arctic with this, but for a city dweller, this coat kept me very warm all winter.  When it was really cold out I added a sweater or a hoodie and was perfectly comfortable. This coat was cut well to accommodate a heavy sweater/hoodie without making it feel too tight or look too small on me, or looking too big on me if I wore just a thinner shirt.As far as the water resistance goes, I was caught in a light shower (not a downpour) and remained dry. The down did not loose it’s loft, just as advertised, so I remained warm. Not sure how well this coat would hold up in a downpour as the outer shell is thin (down coats are notoriously bad in very wet weather; except for very high end, such as Patagonia).Overall, this is a very good coat for the money I paid on amazon ($79) and I would definitely buy it again."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great for layering,4,"This jacket is very lightweight, warm, nice color, fits great ( I'm 5'10"" 150 and got a medium ), 2 zippered outside pockets and 2 interior drop pockets, exactly  as pictured and described and affordable ( I'll address this part later )There are NO storm flaps on any zippers and NO compression carry bagI got this on sale for $42 hence the 4 stars ... if I paid over that stars would've dropped downEdit - ok after havin this coat for a while I gotta change my review ... toasty warm lightweight well made good zips give this a 5 star rating especially for the sale price - still disappointed about not having any zipper storm flaps and no carry sack"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Lightweight jacket for moderately cold weather.,4,"This jacket is a perfect Tuckaway style.I am 6’ and weigh 195. I bought an xl and it was a tent. A large is the right size for me.In other words you can fold it up very small and take it wherever you need.Pros: lightweight, semi warm (20 degrees and up) and comfortable.A con: The jacket is a very relaxed fit. It hangs off of you like a shirt on a hanger and with no draw cord around the waist you feel is the wind could blow up underneath and lift you into the air.I bought it for my car in case of an emergency.It does not seem to be well constructed. Will follow up on this."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Nice jacket, good price.",4,"Looks good. Comparable to other name brand of the same type. It is very lightly filled. I was hoping for a little more filling. I returned for that reason. I already have a Guess that is the same weight. Need something a little more heavier/warmer. I would recommend this jacket. For those that are concerned about the material, this is a popular material that feels delicate but is more durable than you think. This jacket isn’t for going hunting or working outdoors, it is for casual dress at around 40 degrees outside. The material is easy to get stuck in the zipper, that’s my reason for a 4 star instead of 5."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Good quality, good fit, warm lightweight jacket.",4,"Nice, warm quality jacket. However, please note that it does not come with the storage pouch as stated in the description which was pretty important for the use it was intended for. When I called and emailed the manufacturer to see if they could send me one they bluntly refused and issued me a return authorization without even asking if that was what I wanted to do. I liked the jacket and it was a gift so I kept it and made my own storage pouch.  This rating is for the product itself, not the manufacturer as they could have cared less about their customer. I won’t buy from them in the future. I was however happy with the jacket. Maybe they have since removed the included storage pouch from the product description."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great Jacket except for the smell...,4,"I’m a big boy; 6’ and 255 lbs, I bought the XXL, the fit is good although a little tight in the gut if wearing a sweatshirt under it. I bought this after the generally good reviews. The coat is very lightweight and comfortable and feels good on the skin, it seems well made. It is also fairly warm, I just went out this morning with a sweatshirt in  30 degree weather and it was fine. The only real problem, as some have mentioned, is the irritating smell that permeates through the jacket.  I think it must be the feathers. I sprayed a febreeze like solution on it to no avail.  I just washed it and dried it and that seemed to have helped the smell a bit. Good luck."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very light weight non rugged jacket,4,It is what it is folks. This is a very light weight jacket that is not rugged. The weight and relative strength are by design. If you are tough on your gear then this is not for you. Very nice fit and probably the best fitted neck area I’ve come across. Warm enough to about 45 degrees but not much lower. Do not wash this with heavy garnet that have big zippers or other things that could tear the thin outer material. Just be reasonable with what this garnet is designed for and you will be happy with your purchase. Do not dry on high heat and in fact a longer low temp or air only dryer cycle is ideal.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Misleading description, there is no storage pouch!",2,"I'm very disappointed.  I was shopping for a packable down jacket that's why I bought this one since it says the jacket can be packed in the storage pouch included.  Ordered twice, neither one included a pouch.  If they don't want to give out a storage pouch don't say that in the description!  The jacket is nice but what a waste of my time, return both jackets."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"This jacket is made of extremely cheap materials, in my opinion",2,"This jacket is made of extremely cheap materials, in my opinion. If you can imagine - taking a garbage sack and filling it with down feathers - that's basically what this jacket is - hahahahaha!. The external fabric is very very very thin, very much like a garbage sack, but of course more parachute like than plastic. It is very lightweight. Amazingly light! And actually keeps you pretty warm in very cold temperatures. BUT...the downfall? It punctures and rips very easily. It works. Yes. But would I buy another? No way, no how."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great for hiking,5,Bought this for hiking and camping. It packs up nively into a small pouch. And is nice and light and comfortable.I am comfortable wearing this jacket in the mid to high 30's with just a t-shirt underneath.This is a perfect addition to my winter camping gear.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Not much down fill,3,"The jacket fit well and it was reasonably priced, but there was far less down fill in it than I expected. I even put it in the dryer with a couple tennis balls to try to get it to plump up. Nope. I have a jacket I bought from Cabelas several years with the same fill rating, and it is considerably better. I tore it and wanted a similar jacket. This one isn’t it. Name brand didn’t result in the quality I expected."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Good light an warm coat.,3,Had small hole took a pic. Some cotton or feathers is coming out. Product fit great feels great. Just hope not much more stuff comes out lol leave a trail where ive been.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Good jacket for layering system.  I'd recommend.,4,Good jacket for layering.  I wouldn't suggest wearing it as an exterior jacket as its fabric is very light but the overall lightweight factor makes it great for backpacking.I like the Eddie Bauer brand and it lasts forever.  I still have my EB Gortex jacket that I got 20 years ago and it never goes out of style.This jacket was a lot thinner than I expected but it will be great for my layering system to stay warm.  I have a trip planned for Grand Canyon in March and there will still be snow on the ground along upper rim.I would recommend this jacket.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Not for the cold,3,"This is a fashion accessory - - not a real jacket for the cold. There is minimal down, and the cuffs and waist are slightly loose, with no velcro or drawcord. This jacket will not block out the cold in any serious way. But as a casual coat for limited exposure to mildly chilly weather, it'd work. I'll be returning it."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,So warm,5,"If I had to make one complaint about this coat, it would be that it's too warm.  I really like this coat.  It's super light, and warm enough for cold winter days.  Very happy with the purchase.I'm 5'5"", 150 lbs.  Bought a Reg Medium.Fits greatI'm"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,It's like a soggy sponge in snow,2,"I don't know if my jacket is defective or if it's a feature of this model, but this jacket literally sucks in moisture. I hiked a couple times with snow on the ground (not in the air) and bizarrely had soaking wet sleeves when I got back to my car and couldn't figure out how that happened (hadn't been laying in the snow or anything). Then recently I was shoveling and then hiking with snow falling and this jacket was drenched. I looked like I'd been standing in the shower... water literally dripping from it when I took it off. My pants weren't wet except where the jacket had been dripping onto them. My fleece underneath kept my body mostly dry. But this jacket would be an absolute nightmare if you got stuck, were exposed to elements for an extended amount of time, or tried to camp with it. Seriously, it's bizarre how it sucks in moisture rather than repelling it."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Not as described ...I expect to get what I purchase,1,"Product description indicates that the jacket comes with a pouch for storage, but no pouch was included in package. I actually ordered twice, returning 1st due to no pouch, but 2nd order did not include pouch either. I contacted Amazon CS and was told to reorder again and that pouch would be included, so I did. You guessed it, still no pouch!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Warmer than expected,5,"When I first seem this jacket, thought it was too light. But it is actually pretty warm, and if you layer it up. It will easily keep you warm. I normally buy a XL, but this jacket is good as a large, or even a medium if you want to use it as a mid layer type of jacket."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Perfect!,5,"My husband is 5'6"" and 180. He has wide shoulders. This fit him perfectly. It even came earlier than expected. It's super lightweight as well."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Decent jacket let down by smelly down fill,2,"The jacket fits true to size, is lightweight, good-looking, and warm.  Unfortunately, once it is exposed to cold weather, it develops a strange wet-dog-like smell, that internet research leads me to understand is coming from the oils in the down fill.  I've never encountered this phenomenon in the past, but apparently it is not uncommon with cheaper down.  For me, this makes the jacket unwearable - the odor is strong and unpleasant - and I returned it."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,False advertisement,3,I received my jacket today. very nice jacket but noticed in didn't have the included pouch to carry the jacket in. I called Eddie Bauer about this and they said it does not come with the pouch even though that's what its advertised. They said will send you another jacket which they did and I'm suppose to send the other back. Still no pouch in the new jacket. I called them about this and they said send one of the jackets back and will send you a 10.00 gift card. I told them there advertisement is false. Don't expect a pouch for your jacket.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Buyer beware,1,"First, the product arrived late!  The packaging was awful.  The product is as thin as a slice of bread and does not provide any warmth.  TOTAL dishonest description/marketing.  Not worth even $5.00,,, Made in China!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,VERY Thin,1,"Shame on me as I'm sure I didn't read the description right...this is a very this ""shell"". The description gives the impression this is warm...don't hold your breath for what you have to pay! This is a light shell made for probably 45+ degree weather. The MIchigan 20-30 cut right through this thing. Looks nice...just not ready for MIchigan winters. Shame on me again for not seeing through the sexy words that make you think this thing is warm."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Get down for some fun cause it's true down in the sun.,4,"This winter down jacket don't make a racket, nor take up space when moving place to place. The inside is made from downy feathers, plucked from some ducks, and at least from one goose...which is ethically practiced to ensure there's no damage to one or the other, it's in their release. Since its down it can weather whatever it must in spring, fall and winter and in summer go bust. It's nylon shell covers one side to the other, both outside and in, but it's pretty thin skinned not as strong as some others, but it gets the job done.  It also leaves room for some functional fun by leaving undone extra zippers and pockets to hide what you be rocking plus a big hood to stock in.  You can have these installed but it adds to your bill, or buy each separate and the zipper comes free."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Poor quality and dissappointing performance.,1,"I gave this Jacket a fair trial run and used it for 3 weeks including for two backpacking trips. The DWR water resistant treatment is adequate however, the jacket is not durable and began leaking down/feathers early and often. A very dissappointing outcome.The jacket is being returned and did not meet quality standards. I replaced it with the loft tek outdoor vitals jacket  which is already in the mail to replace this as it's being returned."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Good for the Price! Not Very Warm!,3,"Honestly this is a good lightweight puffer. I had three issues with it:1. It's not that warm. It may be good for low 40-50 ⁰F.2. The feathers are cming out like crazy.3. It does not pack into its pocket. So it doesn't matter how light it is when I cannot pack it on the go.Otherwise, this is one of the best puffers for the price. I ended up buying LL Bean primaloft packable jacket."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very light and warm,5,Very light and portable down jacket that looks really nice. It also seems very warm for it’s weight. This is the perfect jacket for traveling as it can be compressed into a small sack. I’m 5’8” and around 150lbs. The size small fit perfectly.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Lightweight and attractive for relatively mild winter temperatures.  I like it for my intended use.,5,"Bought to replace older item.  This is less bulky and so far in our mild winter has been adequate.  I cannot yet evaluate its warmth if we get very cold weather.  It is lightweight, has adequate pockets, and looks good.  I like it, but do feel it may be a little cold when we get ‘extreme’ cold days...but I plan to wear it int car and only short time outdoor activity."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great light weight jacket!,5,I bought this jacket for my husband. He is really impressed with his the jacket on how warm it is and how it fits him. I orderd him the XL tall beacause he always has problems finding a jacket with longer sleeves sense his arms tend to be bit longer. Even thou he wears a size large. The XL still fits him with a slender fit and he can wear his sweetshirts underneth. It does not look bulky. Color is great. Jacket is fashionable and love the super light weight of it.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Ordered with trepidation,5,"Ordered hesitantly after seeing several bad reviews. Mine is perfect so far. Super light weight. Warm. Comfy. Fits a bit big, perhaps to give you room to layer your clothing. Would like to see a slim version. No feathers have come out. I washed mine and it survived perfectly fine. No quality issues. Cannot attest to rain performance. May buy another at this price."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Thin, cheap and very disappointing",1,Is this a joke?  Jacket is so thin and cheaply made. Even with the filler it is barely thicker than my windbreaker with no lining. I can rub across several sections of jacket and not feel any down fill between the outside and inside material. Not keeping and I live in Southern California.  Do not buy if needed for real winter weather.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Good value,4,Got it on sale for less than $60. Down fill. Feels flimsy but actually keeps you warm and is so lightweight it feels like nothing! Amazing. I'm extra tall and got a Large Tall. Slightly baggy in body which my tailor can easily fix and would have liked and extra inch in the sleeves. I am happy with this and those are only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Tall is NOT TALL!,1,"Do not order this jacket expecting the Tall size to be significantly long in length.  I ordered Medium Tall and found it to be 1 to 1.5"" longer than my son's existing Medium (Regular) jacket.  He is 6.2"" and while not horrible it was definately too short!Very disappointed exact sizing for Tall is not listed in product description.  Lastly,  this is more of a wind breaker...little to no filling.  Do not by for warmth!  Overall Poor quality for a winter jacket.  Eddie Bauer is coasting on its prior reputation!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Nice lightweight jacket,4,"Got this for hubby after he got a tear in his beloved older down jacket which is a very similar style but with larger rows of down. I repaired it so he could wear it to work but got him this jacket. Of course he made comparisons. Overall he likes it. Looks nice. Fits nicely. Right away though he noticed it was lighter. On colder days, even when he's not working, I have noticed that he wears his older jacket. Very easy to pack as it compresses down into a small bundle."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Awesome Jacket!,5,"This is an awesome product! It fits me like a glove. It keeps me warm when I need it to. I wear it around the house with it zipped about halfway open and I stay warm. I wear it outside with a short sleeve shirt underneath and 30° weather and I stay warm. If I am exerting myself, I'll have to open it up because I'll get too hot. It's that warm!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Lightweight Medium Warmth Comfortable Jacket,5,I got this for my husband who had never had a down jacket before. He loves how lightweight it is and comfortable. It is not warm enough for frigid weather but is perfect for wearing in 30 degree + or colder if you are just outside for short periods. He does not wear sweaters under it so it could be layered for more warmth. It is his go to jacket.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Versatile Jacket,5,"Fit was as expected. I am a stocky guy with large shoulders and chest and the jacket was roomy without being too loose, over-sized or bulky. I love the versatility of this jacket. So far I have worn it with temperatures in the 30s through the 50s, and it works well for the cooler temps yet is light enough to wear when it is a bit warmer. Also have worn it in the rain and it handled it just fine. The pockets are roomy enough to hold gloves and a stocking cap. Best of all for me, and one of the main reasons I purchased this jacket, it can easily be folded nice and compact in a suitcase. At this value you really cant go wrong with this. Looks great and for a great price."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great coat worn with fleece or hoodie.,5,"Loves it , wears with a fleece or hoodie. (&Winter thermals) No complaints we live in New England, it's gotten down to 18° so far this season. Fits well, my son's 5'10 broad shoulders long arms , about 160lbs oh it also rolls into a ""bag pouch"" , my son loses stuff, this is excellent, goes in the bookbag easy!!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Nice teal color jacket,4,Gave this jacket a 4 star rating because feathers keep popping out of the sewn seams.  Jacket is light weight but warm in 40* F weather.  Jacket is only rain resistance for light rain and will loose is insulating rating as the feathers get wet.  Nice fit and good looking.  Especially like the green/teal color.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Quickly became my favorite jacket !,5,"I spent a lot of time reading reviews of different down jackets, and made the right choice.  I love it!  Fits great, and I get a lot of compliments wearing it.  Hardly ANY down feathers ever peek out of a seam.  Lightweight, and I love the pockets.  Would highly recommend."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Be prepared to be VERY disappointed!,1,"This is a total rip-off by a company that's supposed to make quality merchandise. A down jacket without any down...gee Eddie, what a novel concept. Maybe there's a 1/4lb of down feathers, at best. After being duped, the kicker is yet to come: Eddie Bauer makes you pay postage to return this crappy, and useless product. Pathetic. Never, again, will I buy another Eddie Bauer product, EVER! Not ever....so, yea, good job there in the bait and switch dept, but that is all."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Good,4,"Overall is a good product for the price, not the best. If manufacturer wants to improve quality, I recommend to start with the zippers. I would also change the product description for the temperature ratings from -10F to about 30F; lower than that you feel the cold even walking (moderate activity)."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very Very Very Very Very THIN,1,"Lightweight it is. Down FILLED it is not. Even at this bargain price, I expected a quality product. My husband's puff jacket from Walmart is a better coat than this. I truly do not understand the high reviews!!! They must have gotten a different jacket."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Feathers,1,The feathers keep coming out more and more. Otherwise I like it. Please fix feathers in future
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Much warmer than expected,5,"On the inside tag there is a statement of temperature range for the jacket. 15 degrees while active, 40 degrees inactive. I just got back from Boston where the temperature ranged from 12 degrees to 40 in one weekend and the jacket was perfect. I wore a t-shirt and very light hooded pullover (think an additional loose shirt) under the jacket and was warm walking the streets in snowy conditions with a ~20 degree temp. The next day I wore a thermal underneath the jacket and was almost too warm in low 30's degree temp. Was able to roll it up and put it in my backpack for the my flight and it took minimal space. Very happy with the purchase."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Lightweight warmth & comfort at a great price,5,"I bought this jacket to keep in my new SUV in case it got cold. It was lighter & thinner than I thought but seems to be warm. I like the outside zippered pockets with 2 inside. Looks good, fits well & even comes with a small pouch for packing. Great price for a name brand at $60."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Pouch,5,The jacket is 650 down. It’s not an amount it’s a type. Mine didn’t come with a pouch but I have a couple in my closet and I don’t need them because it folded into the inside pocket if you turn it inside out.  It’s a great jacket for the money. It’s one of three Eddie Bauer jackets I have. It’s by far the cheapest one I have but the one I wear the most so it’s never pouched.With a raincoat over it it’s good to the teens. Now that stays in a pouch.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Buy this now!,5,"I purchased this for my dad. He works outside all year long & we live in a rather cold part of the country. This jacket is light enough to wear on it's own or as a liner with another jacket/winter coat. It is incredible, (no, seriously, impeccable!) at keeping you warm. If you live where it snows & have not invested in a feather-down jacket, you are wasting your money! I bought an XL when he normally wears a LG because I wanted to compensate for potentially wearing layers underneath"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Light Weight Warm Jacket,5,This jacket is light weight but provides sufficient insulation to keep you warm in a mild winter.  We had an unseasonably cold winter in Southern California.  I bought this for my partner and he found it perfect for warmth during extended period outside during chilly evenings.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Eddie Bauer is Finding it's Soul Again.,5,"I'm very pleased. Light, compressible and versatile for many different uses like underneath a mountain shell parka!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,OK Down Jacket,2,"Took it out in the rain/snow recently and unfortunately it isn't waterproof as advertised, after an hour in  wet/cold, I was completely soaked. It still did a decent job at keeping me warm but not really delivered on the things listed."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Light, and fits great!",5,"I'm and equestrian, and I wear this jacket for riding.  The fit is trim and modern, but not constricting.  It's good for cold days, but doesn't get too hot when I work out harder.  And it looks fine too!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Too small but nice jacket,5,"The jacket fits a bit too small. I usually wear a M (5'9''/167 )but this jacket was a bit tight, even without a sweater. On the other hand, I liked the jacket and returning it for a L. i think it's good value for the money but it's certainly not made for very cold weather."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Excellent Jacket,5,"Great fit, light (I want to say less than a pound, really!), warm (for Southern California where low temps are in the high 30s...) and inexpensive.  I am 5'6"" and weigh about 195 lbs. I ordered a large and it feels as if it were tailored specifically for me!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great jacket at a great price - quality workmanship,5,The jacket is everything it says it will be; warm and light weight. The puffs are beautifully stitched and are not bulky. And the color is spot on. Sometimes colors are hard to see online and the descriptions leave you wondering but the dark blue is perfect and looks outstanding with jeans.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Don't let the thinness fool you!!!,5,"This jacket is definitely great in the cold. When I received it and saw how thin it was, I was ready to send it back. Went outside in 27 degree weather and it made a believer out of me!!!!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Warm, light, and comfy. This is as good as it far more expensive counter parts.",5,"This jacket looks nice and keeps me very warm. My daughter borrowed it and liked it so much I got one for her and one for my son who is away at college. For him, this jacket is fantastic as it is super light and can be put in its provided stuff sack for the day during class. This replaced his bulky coat and he is thrilled with it."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Excellent Quality,5,"Good quality, fit, and reasonable price. Easy to pack in a suitcase. Great for a cool day."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Warm at Last!,5,"Got this jacket for my very skinny son. Small fit perfectly, maybe even a little roomy. He wore it all night and said it was ridiculously warm. We'll test it out in the snow and see if that's still true. It did need some fluffing out of the box, but I'm sure it'll be great."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Serves the purpose I wanted.,5,I like this product as it's lightweight and warm.  The nylon material does not seem that durable.  The fit was true to size.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Lightweight, Warm, Water-resistant.",5,Does not impede shoulder action at all. Allows full range of motion. Fits great everywhere and is truly a warm jacket despite being so light in its physical weight. Down used to mean bulk but not any longer. Got to stay warm up here in the northeast!.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Good product.,5,"What’s good: Supper light and warm! (I think the advertised temperature range is correct) Packs very small.What’s Bad: a feather will come out here and there, I’m not sure this product will last but for the price is awesome is you take care of it."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Nice but quality could have been better,3,Am 5’9” tall 160 lbs.  I initially bought my normal size which is medium but I returned because i like fitted stuff and it was a little bit bulky for me. I ended up Ordering size small and it was a better fit for me but the arms are still little bulky like how the medium was. It’s very thin material so u have to be careful bcs the slights thing could tear it. Big nice pockets 2 outside and two internally. It looks nice overall. Temperature here around 30’s and it’s keeping me warm.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Difficult to zipper,2,The zipper on this jacket was difficult to pull up/down. Also lighter weight than expected based on reviews - will not work for a Chicago winter. Returning.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,So far: perfect,5,purchased for my 23 year old son who is picky.  He loves it! keeps him warm when getting into icy car..  Can't believe how lightweight it is!  Charcoal is a great true color.  Haven't washed it yet so jury's still out on that.  Expecting it to be great after washing as well.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Good if it was heavier for the cold weather,1,I thought the jacket was a heavier jacket for the cold fall weather is very very cheaply made for an Eddie Bauer very surprised that’s the reason why am sending it back otherwise it was heavier and better for the colder weather I will keep it thank you
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,DO NOT BUY!,1,The jacket sheds a lot of feathers. Cheap product. Do not buy. I do not recommend it. The customer service is also extremely poor.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Not much down for the money!,3,"The jacket seems well constructed, but I'm disappointed with the amount of down it contains. I doubt that there's more than a single layer of feathers. So, it's fine for a cool day, but it won't be suitable for upstate NY Winter weather. I expected better insulation for the price."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Feels Cheap!,1,"This feels so Cheap!  I’m not sure if it’s a real deal. It is so thin, and horribly put together! Especially for the price. The color was nice and it fit as expected, which are the only positive things about this coat. I’m going to try and send it back."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Love this jacket!,5,"This Eddie Bauer jacket is warm when it’s really cold but yet light weight for driving, I had a EB trail shirt years ago and I loved it, this is as close to the trail shirt as I could find and at an awesome price. I highly recommend it!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Bought as a gift,5,I bought this jacket as a Christmas gift for my Dad. Being as we live in Texas it doesn't get cold enough to get much use out of but the few times he was able to wear it he loved it.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Not warm enough when outside.,2,"Many reviews were great, I like Eddie Bauer, and it felt warm enough when I put it on inside the apartment—-but, when i went outside the warmth left immediately."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Exactly what I wanted,5,"Great jacket, lightweight, reasonable price, well made, warm enough for most of my time outside down to just below freezing. If you are going to be outside for a few hours below freezing you may want something warmer."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Dark Smoke Heather is more BLUE than GRAY,3,"I love the jacket EXCEPT the color... I order a Dark Smoke Heather, thinking it was a shade of GRAY; this jacket is BLUE.  All the studio images of this jacket make it look gray, but don't be fooled.  See the pic for yourself.I may send it back to exchange for another to see if the color is more GRAY..."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Comfortable and Light,5,"I really like how this jacket is light, but keeps me warm.  I do see feathers that come out, but I believe that will stop after several wears without affecting the quality of the jacket.  The jacket is comfortable & stylish."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Blue Collar Patagonia,5,"You won’t find a better light weight down coat for the money, period. The XL tall fits the same as the Patagucci (Patagonia) XXL and is only $71 vs $300.They feel the same and perform the same just a different name."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,A great jacket for all weather,5,The jacket is great for cold or cool weather (0-60 degrees) and its light weight.  The color is exactly what I wanted and it has a nice sheen to the color.  Other reviewer mention losing down feathers but mine has not.  I would highler recommend it hiking or around town.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great lightweight jacket if you live in the Southern Region of the US,5,"Love this jacket. This is the second one have purchased from Eddie Bauer and I have a vest as well. The jacket is lightweight but warm and may be stuffed into a bag, comes with jacket, to about the size of a softball which is great for traveling.I wear a large and jacket fits exactly like a large should fit. I live in Georgia wear winter temperatures probably average around 50 degrees with lows usually getting no worse than high 30 degrees. This is a perfect in my opinion for these temps."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,A typical hoodie is thicker than this.,1,I am amazed at how cheap and thin this thing is.  Chinese made piece of garbage.  Eddie Bauer has sold out to the lowest bidder because they think they can sell stuff because of their name.  Which is true I guess.....I bought one!  NEVER AGAIN.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Fits perfectly,5,"Originally got the large for my son who is 25 years old, 6’2”, 185# and it was too big as he likes a slimmer fit. We exchanged for the medium and it fits great."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Four Stars,4,I expected more insulation but I still like the jacket. Fit as expected.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Nice light and warm pack able jacket.,5,"It’s a nice quality down pack able jacket. Keeps you warm as down should. Lightweight and packs small, so will work great for travel. Love the Gray color, looks wonderful in person."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,This one jacket is defective!,1,"I probably got a defective jacket, only been a few months and it's past the warranty I'm guessing.  I guess they didn't tie one of the line correctly.  I thought it was a left over sewing line hanging from my jacket.  I slightly pulled it and the arm of my jacket just fell apart!!  I'm so disappointed.I've bought my college boys the same jackets and theirs is fine.  Wish the mfg would send me another one."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great jacket for the price,5,"Great jacket for the price!  Bought this jacket for our trip to Yellowstone.  Very lightweight, packable and kept my son warm on those cold mornings and nights.  He is 5’10” and about 125lbs, he likes more of a loose fit and the medium fit great"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Good So Far,5,I am 6’2” 215 lbs and the large is a great fit even with a quarter zip long sleeve fleece pullover and t-shirt beneath it.  Much better fit than the Amazon Essentials brand which I returned.  Also extremely light.  Quality seems to be what you would expect from Eddie Bauer brand.  Haven’t worn it out yet so can’t speak to warmth.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great all around Jacket,5,"I love this jacket, can be dressed up or dressed down. Remember that it is a JACKET, rated around 40°. Partnered with a decent sweater you can easily where this in single digit temps."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Bad customer service,2,I like the jacket but it wasn't what I ordered. It was not the color I ordered and it has a hood and the other had a tall collar. Rather than send it back I'll just keep it. But not happy!
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,THIS IS junk,1,THIS JACKET A TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Looks and feels great,5,Initially bought this for a trip back to the Midwest and wanted something that would fit easily into my suitcase and Not bee too bulky. Really like how lite  it is yet it’s ability to keep me very warm.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Not what I expected,1,"I have had other down jackets, but I would have to look very hard to find any down in this lining.  This is a perfect 75 degree jacket.  I should have returned it because I am disappointed, but I didn't.  I have not worn the jacket yet and probably won't until summer."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great coat. Great value.,5,"Warmer than expected. Not for mountain hikes, but keeping me warm for parking lots and errands in the mid-20's in the upper midwest. Lighter/more compact than I imagined. Great value for the money paid. Small amount of ""shedding"", but not unusual. A bit bluer than expected, based on photo."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Good fit, will like more padding",4,"Will like if it have more padding. It will warm you in average cold but if you are going to a really cold place, not the right one for you."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Light as a Feather,5,"Light weight, warm for moderate cold temperatures, not binding in arms, just right length so I can get in hip pocket. I love to use for golf!  Comfortable—"

Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"What is "" sea gray""? It is light and keep warm.",5,"The color supposed to be ""sea gray""? It turn out to be dark blue. I like it most are warm and light weight.  The quality is excellent. It will last for a long time."

Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,I love the jacket,5,"I love the jacket I ordered, it is super light weight, warm and meets my expectations.  The only problem I had is determining if I should have ordered an XL, and I ordered a large.  A little bigger would have been better.  But, That's my fault, not Amazon.  Thank you!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Light and Warm,5,This product is very light but keeps you warm in the cold.  Nice inside pocket with 2 outside pockets.  Well worth the price.  Why pay double just for the logo?  Perfect when travelling because it is so light you can fold it in a suitcase without taking up much space.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Warm,5,My sons favorite base layer. He puts a gortex liner jacket over to stay dry but this keeps him super toasty. Temps on average single digits at the ski hill.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,The quality is awesome and the price is unbelievable.,5,"There is nothing I dislike about the jacket, it is the perfect weight, length, comfort, warmth and I am wearing it now!  I would totally recommend this to anyone seeking a lightweight down jacket."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Great jacket, Great fit.",5,"I own two of these. I’m 5’4”, a little husky, and I purchased the medium. My legs are short, but I’d say my upper body is very average. It’s a perfect fit. Doesn’t poof out or wear too tight, and I feel like my body can still breathe. It’s definitely very warm and is usually the one jacket I’ll wear in sub 45 degree temps."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Good jacket but light weight for COLD,3,Good for California Cold but NOT EAST COAST COLD.Other reviews were too lightweight and forgiving.....this is a nice LIGHT jacket.KEY WORD- LIGHT....NOT A HEAVY WEATHER COAT. now way. good for Cali February fun and sunYou Have Been Warned!

Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Not a winter jacket.,1,This jacket is a joke. Not fit for purpose. I thought I was buying a winter jacket. It is as light as a feather. And it's even short. Am gonna return it. North worth the price.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Warm as toast!,5,Had this jacket yesterday ago so I decided to buy again.Am glad I did.It is an amazingly warm and lightweight jacket.Highly recommend it!
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Poor quality.,3,"The quality of this “Eddie Bauer” jacket is very poor. Sizing is off, and there are definitely better options available on Amazon. After wearing the jacket once, some of the stitching is coming out on the sleeves. Disappointing."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Lightweight,5,This jacket is so lightweight but offers great protection from the wind. It's rain repellent also.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Not Packable,3,The jacket is very nice and fits well. It is advertised as packable and it is not. A packable jacket has one pocket with the zipper on both sides (meaning) one on the outside and the other on the inside so when the jacket is packed inside the pocket there will be a zipper on the outside to zip it up. The jacket that I received has neither.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Ita a piece of S***,1,"At 1st, it was too large for a Medium size. Ok, I let it slide .  Then , after 1st wash , it shrank and became a horribly looking  rug."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Quality as expect.,4,"Eddie Bauer is not cheap, quality you can always expect. This Jacket not difference, bought on sales. Happy with the purchase if it's more heavy weight."

Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Not for really cold weather.,5,"Known quality, but this not for extreme cold weather.  Too thin for that.  More for casual winter wear."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Questionable Durability,2,The only downside of this jacket is the seams are not sewn well enough. I am constantly finding down feathers that are falling out. I question this jacket's durability. Other than that it would be a great jacket.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Not warm enough,2,"We are Eddie Bauer coat fans, but this one fell short.  Just not warm enough for the midwest."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Duck down NOT Goose down,4,"Have not tested in the cold. Fits & looks nice.NOTE: it said 650 full implying goose down. IS NOT, it’s duck down’"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Nice lightweight jacket,5,I bought this to replace my worn out packable down jacket.  Fit is perfect and so far seems to be holding up.  I do notice some of the down working through the shell but my other one did this as well so I am used to it.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Great jacket, bad description",3,I ordered this jacket in black and it was great until the zipper on the pocket broke a week in. I returned it and tried to order it again but black was out of stock. I liked the grey color so I ordered that instead. The jacket is fine but it's blue not grey. I will keep it but just make sure of your color choices.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"warm, light, comfortable, breathable",3,"3 stars because the materials will rip if you catch literally any branches and the feathers start coming out of basically all seems after the second or third time wearing it. For the price, not terrible"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great warm but lightweight jacket,5,Lightweight but really warm. My husband has repeatedly said how much he likes the jacket. Runs true to size.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Lightweight With Good Fit,5,My son loves his jacket. We live in a warmer climate and grabbed this to go back to the Midwest to visit family. It snowed that weekend and this jacket worked perfectly and looked stylish.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Read the fine print on the return.,1,Don’t buy this product! I purchased a medium tall and it fits like a small. Went to return it and have to pay 17.84 for 7 day ground. Ridiculous!!!!!
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Runs a little small IMO,3,"The jacket is nice, relatively warm (warm to about 25 degrees), and lightweight, but I would say it runs a little small."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,good jacket for the money,4,"so far so good, I have not been out in the rain yet but I love the fact that it is so light but still gives enough warmth."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great jacket,5,I love this jacket. The down keeps you warm but not hot. Perfect weight down to about 40 degrees F
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Exactly what I expected,4,"Been buying EB for years as well as NF. Best quality-value imo. Light, thin and perfect for 40*+ you need to understand how down works to understand how thin. 4 stars because the name across top front left a little much. EB, Go back to a logo!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Lightweight and durable,5,"I bought this product a month ago with weathers in nyc shifting from 50-35 degrees. This jacket holds its ground. It’s very durable, lightweight and keeps in your temperature really well. However, when it does start to drop below 40 all you’d need is a light hoodie for it. Besides that, this jacket is very versatile, fits comfortably and looks well."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Great, packable coat.",5,I got this coat to be the top layer of several layers on colder days and because it appeared to be packable. Turned out both needs were fulfilled.  I put this coat in a daypack along with several other items and it fit great.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Good value,4,Nice jacket...a more athletic cut (less room around the midsection) would’ve been better.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Feathers come out too much!!,2,"Nice soft jacket However I hate that it's brand new and feathers are coming out from all over, causing my clothes to look like I have 5 white very hairy cats"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,A good buy.,4,I got this item last week and it is a good buy.It’s light weight and it is warmer than my other coat.Very good.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Feathers leak out.,4,Don’t like the feathers coming out of the sewed seams. Everyday I find feathers coming out. Will return this jacker because of this.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Do not buy. Poor quality,1,"Worst purchase ever. I saw a few reviews which said it had some quality issues. I assumed that was the exception, I was severely disappointed. Was torn coming out of the bag. Plus it must have been a return because there was a napkin in the pocket."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Good choice for mild weather,4,"Great lightweight jacket. A bit lighter material than I expected. Definitely not a heavy duty nylon shell. I use it for weather in the 40’s. Any colder and you need something a bit more substantial. The jacket does. It fit snug at the waist, so you if it’s windy, you will feel it."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Too expensive!,2,This is the same jacket being sold for $19.00.  You pay $30 extra to have Eddie B on your chest??  DUMB!

Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,OK,4,This is a great jacket. Very light & extremely warm. My only issue is that I keep picking down that sticks out at the seams.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Its not a winter coat like Northface brands,5,This item is without question a jacket not a winter down coat. Other than that it is as described really nice jacket
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Light weight but warm,5,My husband is hapoy with this and he is picky with coats. Light weight but warm..perfect for everyday.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Slightly Small,3,"It's a good material and quality.  Runs about 1 size small around the chest so I'd suggest stepping up one size.  The tall size still didn't hang below my belt line so I wouldn't recommend if you expect it to fit like an average ""tall"" length item."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Feel Cheap Not buffy as it look.,2,"Got the jacket. Great brand! Not buffy at all and feel cheap. If you 6'2"" 175lb, the medium size would fit well."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,This Jacket A must buy,5,At first I was scared that it wasn’t going to be warm enough because it felt so light weight.

Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great everyday jacket,5,"The only issue in had was that for the first week or two of wearing, it would shed feathers way too much, but now it's calmed down."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Got it for a gift,4,"Got this jacket for a gift so I cannot speak directly to the warmth and comfort. Coming out of the box the jacket was very light and was nice because I needed to pack it in a suitcase. Once I give the gift, I can update on how the jacket's warmth and comfort actually rate."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,POORLY MADE....SEE SEAMS SUFFER!,1,I wore this jacket for less than one hour before the feathers started flying like a bad cock fight!  Eddie Bauer was a name I trusted.  So was Amazon.  Please see pictures of what are just one of dozens of down feathers coming from the seams of this brand new jacket.  Unbelievably saddened and angered by this lack of quality.  Disgusting shoddy workmanship.  Demanding a full refund and explaination!!

Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Nice jacket,4,I sent this one back because it just didn't have enough down and wasn't very warm. would be ok for a light jacket in mild cold weather. I went up to the next level and got the First Ascent jacket. Twice the price but twice as warm.
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very Warm,5,"For a light weight jacket, it is amazing how warm it is even on 20 degree days."

Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Quality from Eddie Bauer,5,This jacket is very light making it packable but it is also quite warm and the fit around the neck means no need for a scarf!
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Not with it,2,"Poor quality. Its feather insulted and the feathers are constantly come out of the seems. Since it's feather insulted, when it rains the jacket smells like bird coop or something. It's a mild stench but noticable. The good thing though is it relatively warm and very light weight. All-in-all I don't think this product is worth it's price."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great Deal,4,"Superlight, medium warmth, will work as a standalone coat down to 28 F or as a mid-layer."

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Poor quality. Returned.,1,"I was so excited for this piece to arrive based on the reviews I read, but disappointed immediately after opening the package.It came well packed, snapped up and folded in a clear plastic bag. As I unsnapped the shirt to try it on two of the snaps fell apart in my hands. ""Are you f****** kidding me"" I uttered as pieces of the new shirt rolled in between the floorboards. Further inspection of the shirt revealed other snaps were misaligned, and stitching misplaced.I'm returning this for a refund without even getting to try it on, and I recommend you look elsewear for a quality, heavy outer shirt. I'll stick to my South American mountain range brand."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Over a sweater falls fine. My son is tall 1,5,"I write from Italy. This was a gift for my son. Slightly larger ... I knew that. Over a sweater falls fine. My son is tall 1.75 m x 88 Kg. It 's very happy with this jacket. Highly recommended, great seller.I bought one for me, size XL. Send my photo.Best regards.Claudio Consul"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,READ BEFORE BUYING.,3,"I purchased this jacket for my husband's birthday. The pictures on this jacket look phenomenal and exactly like something he would wear - and the pictures on the ad are the exact same jacket you will receive, however it's very hard to decipher the texture that the exterior of the jacket is made of. We were expecting it to be a soft suede like cotton material and although it is soft, it's definitely more of a water repellent cotton that appears almost silky and shiny like a faux leather in person. It's a very well made jacket but the exterior was not at all what we were expecting. After inspecting the entirety of the jacket, all the buttons and stitches were perfect and the jacket had a nice heft and a very good looking cotton flannel lining that did exclude the interior of the arms. We can't tell you how the product will wash or last because we just received it but we were very surprised upon opening it because of the texture and appearance of the outside of the jacket. The tags match up identically to the ad's listing of the jacket's material (Shell - 63% Cotton and 37% Polyester, Body Lining - 100% Cotton, and Sleeve Lining - 100% Nylon). And I am far from a professional when it comes to fabric but this jacket definitely has a shine to it and a soft, silky, water-resistant feeling that we were not expecting. Overall my husband said he would rate the jacket a 3/5 but I decided to give it a 4 star review because I don't believe the listing to be wrong or fraudulent however the jacket does have a different look in person. I took many angles and close ups of the jacket inside and out (although you still cannot tell the texture - but if you've ever worn a water-repellent jacket, you know exactly what I'm talking about). We ended up returning it because it wasn't what we expecting or looking for, but again, if you are okay with that texture, this jacket definitely appeared to be quality. Hopefully this review will prove helpful to others looking at this jacket!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Cheap quality. Fell apart in a month.,1,I bought this item on March 2nd and have worn it MAYBE 5 times since. And it managed to start coming apart already. If you look at the image it looks like there was never even stitching there to begin with. This jacket is way too expensive for it to only last a month.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Good for fashion, but awful in everything else.",2,"So... I will praise it for the looks. It certainly looks nice as a fall jacket with a small town style. But this tjing isnjust awful.First lets start off with the cotten lining. Only the torso is lined with the cotten. The sleeves are lined with some cheap paper thin synthetic material that feels like it could tear at any moment if you so much as raise your arms.Second. This thing is uncomfortable. Like... They have the cotten lining on the shirt, the cheap plastic like lining that sticks to your arm at the slightest bit of moisture (including humidity from rain). Lets go ahead and tack on that theres NO INSULATION. You just have that rough phaux demin feeling junk on the outside. And the cheap msterial on the inside.The buttons are poorly sown on and looks as if you rip it open like uou can with any other snap button jacket, you will lose some buttons.Overall... If you just want to look good but don't want something usable. Good I guess. Otherwise avoid"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Men men men men manly men men men (oooooooooh) men men men men manly men men men,5,"As others have said, this jacket makes a man feel more like a man. As soon as I got it I tried it on and went to check myself out in the mirror. After roughly two hours of admiring said jacket, I was also pleased to note that my beard had grown two full inches and my voice had lowered a few octaves. I went outside to see how the material would feel in the somewhat mild weather that we were having when I noticed two bears had made their way into my backyard. So I grabbed the nearest diamondback rattlesnake I could find and began swinging it by the tail at one of the bears. Apparently they dislike this because the bear then proceeded to knock me to the ground and try to bite my arm. Luckily I had on this jacket! As the bear's teeth made contact with the jacket, no material gave way, and the bear continued to clamp until his teeth shattered into a million pieces. He curled into the fetal position and I knocked him around for a few minutes just because my cable was out. The other bear saw what happened to his bear buddy and apologized to me, did my dishes for me, and then promptly left before I decided to make him my rug. At this point in time my pants began to sag so I wound the diamondback through my belt loops and tied it off (I considered biting the head off first, but it makes for a nice belt buckle). I went inside, swallowed a few ribeyes, grabbed a 30 pack of bear, mounted my 6' tall pet wolf Tiberius Rex, and rode off into the sunset with actress Scarlett Johansson.Having had this jacket for almost a year now, that first day turned out to be a slow one. Great jacket, do recommend."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,NOT as pictured!!,1,"I bought this coat for my husband as a Father’s Day gift and it was the worst gift ever! It was nothing like what was pictured on the Amazon listing. It looks like a corduroy red/orange Women’s coat and even though I bought it in my husband’s normal size, size large, he could barely button it up. He took photos wearing the coat just to humor me and I have included them on this review.. I would absolutely not recommend this product! False advertisement! See the photos… Hope that helps!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,not good,1,"I have purchased this shirt in the past and had been happy with them. This one is not properly sewn!! The shirt has been washed and the hem does not sit straight. It was a gift and when it arrived, I checked the size and color which was what I ordered. Not untio it was washed did I know there was an issue. The tags are gone and so is the shirt (donated) since my husband will not wear it. Merry Christams to my husband"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Inferior Quality,1,"This item arrived neatly folded and packaged in a sealed plastic bag.  Upon opening the bag I observed threads of stitching hanging down the front of the jacket.  Tried it on and it barely fit.  It was supposed to be an X-Large Tall but  is definitely a Large.  Further observed poor quality stitching on the pockets after removing the jacket.  All in all a very poor quality item.  Don’t be disappointed, avoid it."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Good quality, dont size down unless you have short arms.",2,"*Update 11/27/19: Got my normal size of Large. Cheese and crackers this thing is big. The medium was too short in sleeves but fit well on my 6' 1"" 180 lb frame. The large is like a boat. If you got a large belly and chest and thick arms you're good. All others the company had zero intentions for making this shirt/jacket for you. Too bad because I really like the style and quality but getting returned.*I sized down according to most reviews as I usually wear a large size even though Im thin (6' 1"", 180 lbs) so I got a Medium. The body fit great but sleeves too short. Soon as you raise your arms even slightly the cuffs creep up your wrists. Im afraid if I order a Large itll be way too wide and buyer-beware, the seller here charges $5 for a return... So basically if I try a large and it is way too wide then Im out $10 for nothing. Im docking the star review just for the return charge alone."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Beautiful Practical Shirt,5,"Actually I can't speak to the water resistance of this garment yet since I haven't worn it outside on a rainy day.  My wife and I traveled to the far north of Alaska and we needed some warm gear (even though the main exterior gear was provided for us) and I bought this shirt as well as a Carhartt shirt-jacket.  I love both of them and would buy either again if I needed a replacement.  Comparing the two brands  I can say this: the 2XL Whitetail and 2XL Carhartt both fit well.  I'm about 6 feet and 240 lbs.  They were loose enough to accomodate a thermal shirt or t-shirt underneath them which you may want to do if you are outdoors in cold weather.  Both shirts can be used as either a heavy shirt or light jacket; both are long and not meant to be tucked into things (except a big heavy duty Arctic parka pants).  The Whitetail is lighter and less bulky than the Carhartt and not quite as warm but make no mistake, it is a warm shirt.  This thing is beautiful.  The exterior looks like leather although it's cloth.  The interior has a very attractive orange and brown plaid pattern and an orange trim stripe at about low-collar height.  I really like the appearance of this shirt.  A fine indoor-outdoor, cool to cold weather shirt."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Perfect for my husband,5,Got this for my husband. The fit is as expected and the quality and feel of this jacket are great. He doesnt like anything too tight or heavy because he doesnt get cold too often so this is the perfect fit for him. He wears a 2x in T-shirt’s so I ordered the 3x for him so it wouldn’t be snug and fits exactly how we wanted it to.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,This jacket looks great but is not functional!,1,"I've had this jacket about a year now and I really feel compelled to leave a review to warn others considering this purchase.Let me start with the positives...the jacket itself looks great. The outer material is soft and I really like the brown color.  This is a light jacket and it is very comfortable as long as you do not need to snap it or put your hands in the pockets.  More on that later. That's pretty much the only positives.There are a few negatives that make this jacket almost unwearable in my opinion.  One of the main issues which I noticed in other reviews is that the snaps are very weak.  It does not take much to make them come undone.  This alone wouldn't be a big deal, but the other flaws in this jacket exaggerate the weak snaps.  First of all, the jacket is not cut for normal bodied men.  If you put the jacket on and button it, the pockets are set waaaaaay too far back.  Very unnatural position .  That itself creates too much tension on the front which unsnaps the jacket.  Also, when you sit down, the bottom 2 or 3 snaps come undone every time.  Finally, you have to unsnap the ends of the sleeves when putting on ot taking off the jacket.  (These snaps are weak as well)  The position of the snaps make the armhole too small.  I can't put my hands through the jacket without it unsnapping.Bottom line....if you need a lightweight jacket and do not need to keep it snapped or use the pockets, this one will be okay.  But overall, I do not recommend this jacket.  It's a shame since I think it's really good looking."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Well it definitely looks good when you wear it,1,"Well it definitely looks good when you wear it. But that’s all the positives I can give it. The construction of my jacket was very poor. It was a little big for a medium but that wasn’t a problem because it made the jacket perfect for layering. However I’ve only had the jacket for a little more than a month and it’s already ripped twice. The first time the flannel lining on the inside ripped near its seam. SInce it was not visible, I simply sewed this up and figured it was a freak accident that caused the rip. Now a week later the jacket has ripped on the outside in a completely different spot. I was very disappointed with my jacket. It doesn’t matter if a jacket looks good if it falls apart when you wear it."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Nice jacket, but really strange fit",2,"I was really excited for this jacket because I have been looking for one in this style for a while. I saw that the size tends to run large, so I bought a small (I'm usually a small/medium... 5'7"" 170lbs). When I tried on the jacket, I noticed that the proportions were just... off. The pockets were on the sides of the jacket, meaning I had to practically reach behind my back to get into them. The chest and shoulders are perfect, yet still the waist is too small. They clearly just use the same size sleeves for all jackets, cause they are extremely baggy. It's also a little long, so if you're on the short side like me be aware.It's a nice jacket, don't get me wrong. I like the style and the color and the texture, but it just fits weird. If I went a size up, I'd imagine it would just be loose everywhere except my waist. So, I'll be returning it."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Perfect for high 40s to low 60s,5,"This jacket is ideal for filling the gap in your wardrobe when it is too cold to wear just a sweater, but too hot to wear a leather jacket.  It is not terribly warm -- but that is the point.  It is easy to carry around if it gets warmer in the day.  Also, you can wear it with a tee shirt on those days when you might otherwise wear a tee shirt and sweater.  It does well in the rain, although it is not a raincoat.  In a light drizzle, you can walk for several blocks without an umbrella.  It is really perfect for fall days.It is very well made -- a pleasant surprise at this price.  It looks great -- looks like and has the heft of oiled canvas (but it is not, thus not actually oily).  It has attractive orange piping inside and under the collar that is a very nice accent.  Wear the collar up or down.  True fit.  I just love the jacket, and it is one of those that I expect to be still wearing years from now."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Super comfortable, great balance between warmth and weight",5,"I know clothing style and preference is extremely subjective. What I look for are material, quality of workmanship and price (usually in that order).For material, I'm completely satisfied. It's a perfect balance of warmth and weight. In places where I don't have a control over the AC (usually around 68F) it adds just the right amount of warmth. Outdoors, it has good sun protection. The fabric is soft (after a couple washings). Color has remained the same and no obvious dye runout. It is heavier than a shirt but lighter than a typical jacket, and can be worn as a shirt without looking odd (or so I think, but I have not taken any polls).Workmanship appears fine. I don't see any loose stitching or open seams. Buttons are firmly attached. Fit works for my body type. I'm overweight (5'9"", 210lbs) and can close all buttons without laughter from colleagues."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Size review for men...,5,"Not sure about that “working out” star selection, but normally wear a lot in 2x these days .. 6’0” and 235-240.. some beer belly but not a lot.. this 2x I wear over a carhartt hooded sweatshirt w/ a lot left Over for room especially in stomach.. arm length is spot on (36-37” I think)  chest is good w/ extra room (50” guy) next time I’d get a XL Tall. Can’t speak for durability but I do like it."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Perfect Jacket,5,"This jacket is pretty much exactly what I expected it to be. It is comfortable, warm, and works well when layering. It is aesthetically the best jacket I own.There are a lot of sizing complaints but if you check out their site it says the fitting is for big n tall. If you are on the shorter side then it probably won't fit as well. I'm only 5'11 with a pretty narrow frame and it fits well with just a little extra length in the tails. It is somewhat large, but not drastically. Sleeve length is perfect. I did go one size smaller (small instead of medium) given all the recommendations in the other reviews and I'm glad I did.For this price I don't know if you can get a better jacket."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great camp jacket,4,"For starters, I am 6' and 250#.  My inseam is 30"", so I am mostly trunk.  I usually order XXL Tall, but after seeing some of the comments, I went with XXL.  I am glad I did.  The fit for me is pretty near perfect, with enough room for a sweater or other layer beneath.  I am glad I did not get the tall, as the sleeves would be way to long.Chest is lined with flannel, arms with a poly or nylon.  For mine, the fit and finish were pretty good.  No issues with snaps or fraying.  My only gripe, and it isnt much of one, is the placements of the side pockets.  The openings are at the side seams, making it a little awkward to get your hands in, and for me, leaving them there left my arms and shoulders cocked back a bit, rather than a more natural forward.  I dont keep my hands in my pockets often or long, so it is only a slight gripe.  A bit more ergonomics could have been achieved moving them forward a few inches.I love how it looks like a nice thick shirt, feels like a jacket.  Not a winter one, you would definitely need layers, and I could actually see this one as a mid layer; wicking undershirt, thermal shirt, this shirt then heavier shell/coat.  I went for a walk around the block a few times and it is just at 40 deg f with some decent wind downtown, and I was comfortable with a slight chill - I only had a shirt on underneath.  Again, I will be using this as an early/mid fall or spring shirt rather than winter coat.  And I realize it was not meant to be a coat."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Love the jacket, hate the patch.",4,"I really like this jacket!  Like others here have said (and shown in photos), the color is darker than the product image implies; claudione60's screenshot in the reviews is a much better picture and more representative of the look (honestly, they should replace the product image with just that dude modeling; he rocks it).Also, like others have said, these things come in bigger than you might expect.  I'm between a medium and large, and this product's medium is very big.  Still, I have long arms, so I probably couldn't get a size lower.The only issue I had was that the patch (which has the whitetail logo on it) is just ugly; which I guess means I just don't want pictures of animals on my clothes.  It's hard to see in the product image, and other review photographs of the jacket, but the patch image is of the head and antlers of a buck.  But, it's just a patch; with some careful and precise snips, I was easily able to take it off, and now it's perfect!  Removing it left an outline of where the patch was, and obviously very small holes, but it's not super noticeable; I'll see how it looks after a wash and try to update my review with an image later.I feel like I should mention that it's not the warmest jacket ever.  It's thin, and doesn't even seem to warm me as much as a light hoody does, but it may retain warmth better than a cotton hoody would in the wind.  It is very comfortable though, so it's a nice jacket to keep on indoors.Overall, I really do like this jacket, I would have liked it more if I didn't have to modify it myself after the fact."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Great jacket, Weak snaps",3,"I have to start this review with the statement that this had become my favorite jacket. It's perfect for my personality and style, it's warm. and it's unique. I say ""had"" because most of the snaps down the front of the jacket are weak and come open with only slight amounts of tension/movement. I didn't really notice this until now that it's colder (I had bought the jacket when it was warmer and didn't snap the front closed) and my return window has closed ~2 mos. ago. I spoke to Legendary Whitetails and the rep told me that they had a couple complaints in this area, but they couldn't do anything for me because I bought it on Amazon. Not sure what I'm going to do with the coat. As much as I like it, I'm not sure I want to deal with the front coming open...Kinda defeats the purpose of a jacket...To keep warm, right?"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,5 Stars For - (The Fleecing Of America),5,"Nothing of quality about this shirt, not the material, not the thread or the stitching, nor the thickness or durability.  Cheaply made (In China) and most definitely not worth 1/2 the purchase price.  The style is nice and the button design is unique, but that’s the extent of it.  Worn approximately a dozen times as a shirt jacket, for a few  hours at a stretch (not doing what anyone could ever begin to consider doing any sort of real work in) and washed half that many times, and the damned thing is falling apart at the seams.Putting  Journeyman into the name, is a great sales pitch but an insult to every Journeyman in the nation or any working man or sportsman for that matter. (because their all the same guys) Do yourself a favor and buy yourself a Carhartt, and you you will actually feel good about it when it finally begins to show signs of wear because you will have actually worn, washed and worked the hell out of it by that time.I wish I’d had a test dummy friend, would have saved the money."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Poor quality snaps with delicate spring that falls out.,1,"Looks good. But poor quality snaps broke in the first hour.The cut is for fat guys. If you aren’t kinda fat, this will not fit you well, but it’s good enough.The fabric is beautiful. It is soft and looks durable. Exactly as I’d hoped. I’m very disappointed about the snaps. Clearly a design flaw."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,If the snaps worked- I’d give a 5 star,3,I would love to give a 5 star & would of it the the top snaps of this shirt worked. They won’t stay snapped.... I’ve considered returning it for another but feared the same thing would happen -although I’ve never had this issue with “legendary” product but I don’t want to deal with the return..... is there anything that can be done without returning?
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"What is this, a suit jacket?",2,"This thing's sleeves are lined with cheap, slick, polyester-or-whatever material, NOT FLANNEL. I suppose it's so your arms can go right inside but wearing it with a t-shirt SUCKS because the feeling of that liner is, and there's no other word for it: Icky.Beyond that, the fit is, well, a word that rhymes with ""fit."" Sleeves are far too baggy, about as baggy as a Carhartt welder's jacket, and boxy to boot. I'd have gone down a size but the sleeves would be far too short, as the large's sleeves already are. I ordered a large and I'm 5'10, about 200lbs.Bottom line, not bad for the price I guess, but could be better and should be better detailed in the description."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,I love this thing,5,"I live in the pacific northwest and this 'shirt jacket' has been perfect for the weather.  It's sort of a waxed cotton like texture and while I wouldn't wear it in a downpour, it's been sufficient when there's been the inevitable fall rain around here.  If it suffers from anything it's that it's not really either a shirt or a jacket and by trying to be both it runs into issues.  It isn't as roomy as a jacket and is cut more like a shirt so it is considerably more snug.  If you've got a belly, it's not going to keep that a secret.  It doesn't have the normal material stretch that say a cotton hoodie or a fleece pullover or vest would have.  At the same time, it's not lined in the sleeves so you're unlikely to want to wear this with just a t-shirt on underneath.  Also, at least to me, the difference in sizing between a Large and an XL is way more than one size.  I actually ordered an XL after my L because I like it so much that I wanted one a little bigger to wear a hoodie or similar under it when it was colder.  The XL was like a XXL at least so it went back.  Again, though, as casual wear it's nice and I am very happy with it.  Happy enough, in fact, to be on here today ordering another one to give as a gift this Christmas."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Comfortable and durable,5,"I needed a spring and fall jacket that I could wear everyday and a variety of situations. I got exactly what I hoped for! The jacket is extremely comfortable and you almost forget it's there. The exterior material is very flexible but seems very durable and has held up well in the month or so I have used it. Collingwood, going to lunch with friends, going to work, to the ballpark with the kids... The jacket seems suitable for all of those. I'm very glad I bought it, and I highly recommend it to folks sleeping for something that is warm, comfortable, and."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Sizing is inconsistent,3,"I’m 6-2, and a trim 180, so I ordered a Medium which was very boxy and big. It was a “large” medium. So, I returned it for a Small - which turned out to be a “small” small. Quite a difference. Short sleeves and would not button all the way. Seems the sizing is very inconsistent which is disappointing because the item seems well made and is fashionable. Too bad, but I’ll try another brand."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,I don't know why the other reviews are saying that ...,3,I don't know why the other reviews are saying that it runs a size small it definitely does not. I am 5-9 165 pounds I've been a large my whole adult life. Because of the reviews I ordered a medium and it barely fit over a t-shirt I couldn't lift my arms up and it was pulling real hard on my back. I'm a 40 jacket regular with a 30 waist. If you want to wear it under a sweatshirt or hoodie definitely go one size up. I read review where a man who was 225 lb 6 ft 3 didn't fit into a large it's impossible trust me.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Fits Well, True to Size, But Made in China",5,"This is a great looking jacket, casual, fits well, and is true to size. There's no need to size up to accommodate a shirt underneath; it arrived very wrinkled, but hanging it on a clothes hangar for a couple of days helped remove most of the wrinkles. The jacket will be perfect for cooler autumn days. The only drawback is that it's made in China. Wish it were American made. It was purchased as a gift and was well received. Recommend."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Cheap manufacturing,1,"Fit nicely, but sleeves are unlined. I was looking for something warm, and fully lined. Unfortunately, it seems they wanted to go the cheap route with this product, starting with leaving the sleeves unlined.Manufacturing is cheap, even down to the design decisions. The hand pockets are set along the side seams, likely to save money on manufacturing, but that sets them awkwardly far back. Cheap, cheap, cheap. Such a shame, because I have a Legendary Whitetails coat that I love.I would not recommend this product."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Third time is a charm,3,"This is the third attempt at this jacket. The first was way too big. I wear XL but I could fit another person in the XL. Second one was a large, great fit but but crap quality. Had to go back because the seam under the collar was falling apart :/Third one was the charm. Figured that the quality control is iffy and based on all the good reviews there must be a a lot of bad ones out there"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great Shirt Jacket,5,"There are a lot of reviews discussing the sizing of this shirt jacket. That was by far my biggest contention with ordering it. To make a long story short - I am 5' 10"" and weight 170 pounds and the medium is close to perfect. It might be a slight bit big around if I am wearing a t-shirt, but I am pretty sure if I went down a size then it would be too small, especially if I was wearing a sweatshirt or a sweater. I am very happy with the size.It is a very good looking casual lightweight jacket. I really love it. I chose this shirt jacket over other brand's shirt jackets, because this one looks more like a jacket than a shirt, where-as the other brands look more like an oversized shirt which I did not like.I only have one issue with the jacket and that is the size of the inside pocket. It is a little small and will not fully hold a large sized cell phone. If it were a little deeper, then it would be ideal."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Love the shirt/jacket,5,"Absolutely LOVE this shirt/jacket. Purchased to wear for chores outside. Can also be used as a rustic dress shirt. Material on outside is soft and appears to be water resistant, can't remember if it is or not. The inside is a light gage flannel type. I ordered the 2XTall because I like things longer in arm length and body length. Very nice shirt."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Sizes are off,4,"I ordered a large a couple of years ago and it was huge. I like the jacket, so I figured based on how huge the large was that if I ordered a medium it would fit. I got the medium and it runs small! The side pockets are also too far back, you have to reach almost behind you to get your hands in your pockets.It does look great, is warm and comfortable for the most part but the sizing is just way off."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Best jacket,5,"For the record I purchased a large tall and I am 6ft 1inch and 160 pounds.This is my favorite jacket. It is warm, durable, water resistant, and looks amazing.As I ordered a large-tall the sleeves are long enough to cover my hands a bit and the length is long enough so that it's about 12inches below my belt. It fits a bit large on me, but that's what I wanted.I ended up putting a bunch of patches on this jacket, and it's now my horror/halloween patch jacket.I rated it a 3 out of 5 on the ""light weight"" category, but that's how oiled cotton is. It will always be heavy.It is a very well made and comfortable jacket."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Wonderful shirt.,5,"Probably the best flannel shirt I  have. Perfect for winder. Superb quality.material is heavy which I  like the most. Color has survived uncounted washings and ironing. Actually,  I  stopped ironing as this style doesn't even need it. I wish they either added the second pocket on the right side ot eliminated the ""pencil stiching"" which makes the pocket narrower and makes it harder to put a smart phone in it. Giving 4 stars for that just to draw attention.Definitely recommend to buy and will buy more for myself."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Nice jacket, way too long",5,"Not much in this review as I had this jacket for approximately 5 minutes. Overall it seemed like a nice quality jacket. Warm, comfy and nice looking. My issue is that it was entirely way too long. I am 6’00, about 165lbs and ordered a Medium and it came down almost to my knees. This doesn’t effect product quality, etc, but I this did not fit my style or expectation of the jacket at all. The jacket fit great everywhere else, Just be forewarned that it is very long."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,NOT FULLY FLANNEL LINED!,2,"To start, this is only flannel lined in the body of the jacket while the arms are just a cheap, thin silk-like liner. This was not in the item description, in fact, they seem to purposely only show where the flannel is in the advertisement.As for fit, I sized down intending to wear this over at shirt only. The body fit looser to what I expected… it is far from a tailored fit. The arms had entirely too much material and seem very baggy even though the length is spot on.I would have considered keeping the jacket if it had a more tailored fit to it even though they cheaper out on the flannel lining. But with both of these issues I will be sending it back. I always hesitate buying any sort of clothing online for this reason."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Lightweight Jacket that Looks great,4,"So this jacket is comfortable and looks great, but it is a light weight jacket.  I layer a a t-shirt and flannel shirt underneath for warmth, the snaps are light weight so don't plan on keeping it snapped if you're working out on the ranch or farm.  This is a more fashionable jacket.  But it does look good, and it wears well.  I usually wear an XL but chose the Large, and still have room to layer underneath.  I expected to return it after reading the reviews, but once it arrived, I love it and have kept it.  But this jacket will not keep you warm alone.  But it will make you look damn good while you're working on the farm.  And if you're a young, single farmer like myself, well, every little bit helps :)"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very good,5,"I am 6'  and 175 lbs with a slim build, large fits perfectly.About the only thing that could ever get me to wish for cool weather is this jacket.I am very much cold-averse and this jacket has me covered on crisp mornings, very warm and nicely fitted.I'm also label averse and the arm badge removes easily with a careful, sharp razor blade.Instant favorite jacket.Recommended if you like thick, heavy, well-made clothes."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Awesome!!!,5,"I was looking for something lightweight yet warm and wouldn’t feel bulky. Read reviews & opted to buy Whitetails Journeyman Flannel Lined Rugged Shirt Jacket. Received my original order sized XXL & it was too big, so I had to submit for an exchange. Received the correct size and absolutely love it. Great fit, lightweight, warm and easy to move around in. Love the oil rubbed look and feel. Perfect jacket shirt for cool weather. Temp in the low 30’s and I have had no problem staying warm. Highly Recommend!!!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Excellent quality,5,"Just received my package today. I love this jacket. Feels high quality and warm enough. I’m 5’9” 200lbs. The large fits me exactly the way I wanted not too big, but big enough to layer. I had to wait until the tobacco color was in stock in the L size. I’m glad I did the color is excellent. Overall very very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Bought it as a jacket..,4,"Not very insulating, the arms on the inside are not the same as the lining..Was not very warm, or water resistant like a waxed shirt would be..But it never said it was in the description, so I am happy, looks great..I live about a mile up the side of a mountain and wear it every morning before the sun comes up..I sprayed it with Camp dry silicone spray for tents and it now sheds water and is still breathable. But the lining will adsorb water if it runs down your neck so wear a hat with a wide brim  in the rain.."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Excellant high quality clothing!!,5,"This is a FANTASTIC jacket!! Its warm, water repellant and it looks GREAT!! I get compliments on it often and now I bought 1 for my dad, he likes mine so much!! Hi quality clothing, thus company really knows how to make high quality clothing. I am extremely happy with this buy. I have bought several jackets from them now because the quality us so excellant!!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Starting to fall apart after three months,3,"I like the color and the quality of the fabric used to create this gown. However, I've owned it for only about two plus months and it's already falling apart. There is a seam behind the pocket for your hand and the one on the right hand side opened up and now it looks like two pockets, the real one and the one between the liner and the pocket. And it's getting worse every day. I'm not a happy camper now."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Good lightweight, cool weather chore jacket, needs very small improvements",4,"Solid construction.  High quality snap buttons.  Fit is true to size IMO.  It is more of a cool weather addition to your wardrobe than a true lightweight jacket in my opinion...like something you throw on to go get an armload of firewood or to go check your mailbox.  Definitely nice enough for casual evening outings.I have one complaint and one criticism.Complaint:  The openings for the hand pockets seem to be farther ""back"" than most jackets.  To me it feels like I have to reach much farther back to get my hands in the pockets...almost like I am trying to reach for the back pockets on my jeans or like reaching to scratch your lower back near the side of your body.Criticism:  Lining could be more plush to add a little more insulation quality"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Shoddy quality control.,1,"I was initially very happy with this product. At 6'3"" with long arms this is one of the best fitting pieces of equipment that I have purchased. The fabric was soft and water resistant as expected but unfortunately the craftsmanship of the product was terrible. The seems in the under arms came undone with less that moderate useage around the house.  I can't see how this product will stand up to the harsh conditions of deer season if it doesn't stand up to chores around the house."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"This is a great looking, feeling",5,"This is a great looking, feeling, and fitting shirt jacket.  The material is extremely fine woven cotton to the point that it appears to be ""waxed cotton""; although, it is not.  I get lots of, ""Where did you get that great looking shirt""? Some mistake it to be a soft lamb skin leather.  It kind of looks and feels that way in the Tobacco color.  Just a note on price.  I ordered the Tobacco

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Rugged Shirt Jacket Tobacco Large

   one from Amazon on Nov 28th got it for $69.99 Free shipping, arrived on Nov 30.  Good deal.  I liked it so well I wanted to order the Tarmac color, went to the Legendary Whitetails website on Nov 30th, used their promo code, got $14 off plus free 4 to 7 day shipping for a total of $55.99.  Should have checked their website before ordering from Amazon.  Usually Amazon is the best deal, but not this time."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Weathered, rugged and still classy",5,"The outer shell feels like a lightweight waxed canvas that repels minor spills. So far I have been wearing it business casual and appears way more relaxed when I rolled the cuffs back to reveal the inner fabric. I did have to reinforce the right seem stitching, vertically along the side pocket, and secure the over stitch ends at keys spots to keep from fraying in the future. I have also been using it as a light duty shop jacket, which I did change out to leathers when I get to business."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great Jacket for your everyday occasion!,5,Love the look and feel of this jacket. It feels a little heavy when you hold it but it wears very lightly. The inner lining is very soft and warm and has an inner pocket on the left. They run a little big. I ordered a size medium thinking it would be a little more snug but it almost fits like a large. Still love this jacket as an everyday jacket.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Not worth the price, get 1 size smaller American sizing",3,"It’s nice. It’s like soft/smooth. I thought it’d have a more leathery feel, but that wasn’t my problem why I’m giving this 3 stars. I’m an XL it was too big on me especially the belly and sides area. My brother is a 2-3xl and it fit him better but still looked a little weird on the side area. But it looked a lot better on him than it did on me. So I gave it to him. He was happy, but I did not like what I got for that price. Also, if you’re looking for American size make sure to order at least 1 size smaller. Ex: I’m XL & this was at least a 2xl, so I should’ve gotten an L"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Stitching came undone within a month,1,Loved the coat when it arrived but less than a month since I purchased it the armpit stitching has blown out. Pockets are in an awkward position. I have no intention of trying to return through Amazon. I'm not going to waste my time mailing back a defective item etc.. lesson learned. Junk
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Looks nice, but...",3,"The shirt jac is definitely a cross between a shirt and a jacket. In this case, it looks like a jacket and is about as warm as a button down shirt. I get compliments on it, but I can't imagine using this jacket for much more than yard work in the future - which is fine, although probably not $70 fine (what I paid).Pros:- Looks good- Breaks in over time to conform to your movements- Can easily layer with itCons:- Hand pocket location is really odd (they're too far back)- Not warm at all- Fit is large/a bit oddThe quality seems to be a little lacking, so I question how long it will last. Can't list that as a con yet though.Overall, it's ok (2.5 stars in my book, but I'll round up to 3). I'll use it without caring if it gets dirty, cut, scuffed, etc, etc, but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Ok but looks & feels cheap.,3,"This is ok for a lightweight over shirt. The lining is good. I saw a reviewer complain that the sleeves weren't lined with flannel but that's ok with me. Flannel in the sleeves would make it hard to get your arms through if you're wearing a long sleeve shirt of any kind. What I don't like is the feel of the outer material. It has a slick, cheap look and feel for lack of a better description.  This will be relegated to to a fall/spring yardwork shirt."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,outer shell similar to oilcloth.  LOVE it!,5,"I bought XXXL for my ""Shrek Shaped"" husband who works up north.  He's all shoulders and chest and arms and belly.  He LOVES it.  The canvas outershell is lightly coated with a waxy feeling covering similar to oilcloth, which he loves.  However, the shirt/jacket is not stiff and moves on the body easily.  There is an inner pocket, which is really nice, and the tag reads that it is machine washable and dryer safe at low settings.  Thsi shirt is a real winner!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great All Around!,5,"This ""shirt"" jacket is just what I was looking for - a mid weight coat over a long sleeve warmer shirt for fall and early winter.I'm usually between a L and an XL on outerwear (6'1"" 190 ibs) Got an L and the fit is perfect!Want something a little out of the box from the norm? - you can't go wrong with this."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Short/Wide sleeves, WIDE bodied",2,I'm a 5 foot 11 guy about 175 pounds of almost pure muscle. This thing is made for someone who never reaches out for anything or bends over to pick something up. The sleeves would be too short if I went a size down. They are just too baggy and the body could fit 2-3 of me in it. Typical american made oversized in width not enough length clothes.. :(
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Distinctive,5,"For me its a Jacket / shirt, it's well made with characteristic design elements i really like, very casual look. I chose 2X Large which is a good fit for me, 6 feet tall, 250, lbs  with room for a sweater or shirt underneath. The side pockets are unusually back along the jacket, but it aligns very well from the shoulders to the waist. For me its an ideal fall/ winter jacket I don't spend a lot of time outdoors, basically house to car to work this jacket is perfect for my life style . But what ever your lifestyle this jacket will give you the style and comfort you will like"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great Product,5,"I picked this up to replace a fleeced flannel I've had for almost 30 years, granted its not the ""comfortable"" familiar shirt jacket but this has worked out great in our mid 30 degree weather thus far. I like the way it stops our winds and maintains good body heat. I will purchase this jacket again should I wear this one out as the former."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,nice shirt,5,"I didn't buy this as a coat so this was exactly what I was expecting ,actually its a little better than I expected , I read the complaints and not a single bad review applies to what I received , as for the guy who had a hissy fit because the sleeves were not padded , that's a coat , this was correctly advertised as a ""shirt jacket"" ,if you want a coat ,buy a coat  , I have a similar item made by Carthart and its comparable ,which is again exactly what I was looking for , I would not hesitate purchasing another when the time comes"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Love these shirts - now own several colors!,5,"These aren't cheap, but they will hold up in my closet and on my shoulders probably until they are donated to Goodwill after my funeral. Very comfortable. Large fits well on my 195 lb. 6'1"" frame. I like how these are not as baggy as other field shirts (like LL Bean's) I've tried."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Worth it. My boyfriend LOVES it.,5,"Bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. He says its comfortable and feels sturdy. Its not super heavy, so it may not be the warmest jacket on the coldest days, but its good for windy days and fall weather. He loves the design, and the color i ordered (the tabacco brown) looks quite good on him. I ordered a medium, hes 6ft tall and sits at around 170 give or take. The length was perfect for him, although he said because its a medium the pockets felt weird where they sat in the design, but he isnt worried about it. This made an awesome early christmas gift for him, as hed lost a previous jacket similar in a car accident (it was his favorite, but it had to be cut when he went to the hospital for the accident). Worth the buy."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Got a dress, not shirt!!!",1,"Was really looking forward to this for my husband. But when we got it, it was a  corduroy women dress! Bag had all these different tags on it! Very disappointed!!!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Binding fit in shoulders,  POLYESTER sleeves bunches up in armpits",1,"Wasn’t impressed with the quality, thickness, nor the durability, I have broad shoulders and found this limited freedom of movement, unlike a Carhartt flannel line shirt. It also wasn’t fully flannel lined, having polyester in the sleeves which bulks up in the armpit area...I’ve had it 2 years, and have worn it twice and still disappointed in myself for not returning it in the first place..."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Hand pockets are set back a little too far, made into the side seams.",4,"This seems to me a well made garment. It seems to fit to correct size... not smaller or larger than your usual size. The only negative thing I have to say is that the lower hand pockets are made into the side seams, probably to give it a more shirt look. The pockets being made into the seams sets them too far back to put hands in comfortably. Sometimes even bit of a struggle to put something in the pockets."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Rugged Shirt Jacket,4,"This is a really nice jacket, and very warm!  The downside is that the buttons on the jacket come undone fairly easily when sitting down in the car, or leaning over to pick something up off the ground.  The jacket also runs fairly large, so be advised of the sizing before you order.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the coat though.  It was shipped and arrived promptly as guaranteed when I purchased it.  Thank you!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great shirt,5,This shirt is the best. It made me an official fan of this brand. I am 5 10 and 180 lbs. It fits great. Can fit a hoody under. The snaps are sturdy. Its stitched great. I got mine on a super sale. Would never pay full price for this thing. But i also wouldnt pay full price for something as stupid as clothing.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,I love it... my favorite shirt/jacket!,5,"I love this shirt.  I had asked my wife for a LL Bean ""Hurricane"" shirt, but when she gave it to me I was very disappointed in the cheapened quality compared to prior years LL Bean Hurricane shirts.  I returned it and ordered this one.  I totally LOVE this shirt, and practically live in it.  Looks GREAT, it's nice and heavy and warm, has plenty of useful pockets, and it's almost like a leather jacket.  HIGHLY recommend this great shirt/jacket."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great value,5,I’m 5’11” 224 Lbs. 48 inch chest.Size XL fits perfectly. I wish the sleeves were an inch longer.I wore it today in 30 degree weather driving my dump truck. Kept me comfortable both in and out of the cab. Not bulky like my carhart jacket would be. Nice shirt. Had a lady give a good look at me so I’m guessing they find it attractive on a man. Or she thought I was a dork.I’m going with manly.I
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Super purchase,5,This is a beautiful crafted over coat. Stitching is smooth and strong. Collar lays nicely. Material is butter soft. Feels like soft suede. Liner is soft and warm but not to thick with smooth liner in arms for easy on-off. I love it when my husband wears this coat. Perfect.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Uhh,...it’s shiny",3,"It’s the right color, it fits real good, the basic shape and cut are very nice, but… It’s shiny! It’s like someone sprayed it with that waterproofing spray that you put on your boots. You can’t tell in the picture but… It’s… Shiny!! I don’t know how I feel about having a shiny coat that’s supposed to look rugged and manly. I don’t think you can be rugged and shiny at the exact same time. Seems like they cancel each other out. Did I mention it’s SHINY!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Go Up One Size,5,"I liked the material of the shirt and the lining. I usually wear a medium. But this medium was way too tight in the chest with just a t-shirt underneath. . I am 5'9"" and 147 pounds with an athletic build. I plan to use this shirt to wear over a sweatshirt.So I am returning the medium and ordering a large. A few years ago when I ordered from Legendary I had to return the medium and order a small. They must have gotten a new provider. The return was very easy and free."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Comfortable, Attractive Jacket",5,This jacket is perfect for fall days that start out cool and warm up by noon.  It reminds me of the CPO jackets from years ago. I can't believe the number of nice comments about how attractive it is.  Worth the money!
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Love it!,5,"Exactly what I was hoping for. I generally don't buy clothing online, but this shirt-jacket looked too good to pass up. It has the look of oiled leather and will make a great lightweight jacket perfect for this time of year. Good fit too."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Looks good, but poor quality and weird pockets",3,"Overall it's an ok light jacket/heavy shirt.  The fit is good provided you order a size smaller (if you're not layering), and it looks nice.BUTThe side pocket openings are in an awkward position, close to the centerline of your side, so to access them you have to put your arm back pretty far.  It's uncomfortable for me and I'd guess most people.The button fasteners are also extremely low quality, I'm guessing just stamped on the fabric.  The wrist snaps didn't hold very well, and eventually fell off after a month of light use."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Beautiful looking shirt but not well made,3,"Just my experience, but I purchased this based on the look and reviews. I began wearing it and then after three days the snaps on the cuffs stopped working. They wouldn't stay together. I spoke with Amazon, but was unable to get a replacement so because Amazon is the great company they are, provided it to me at no cost.I only wish I could get the cuffs to stay together because it's really cold here right now!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,This jacket is ideals for layers,4,"Light weight and stylish, deep pockets on the side, hold a cell phone comfortably with no falling out due to pocket depth and shape. I like that as the breast pockets do not hold your phone securely. Overall a good garment to wear."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Bad quality and horrific customer service,1,"I've used jacket less then 20 times for casual wear, and already the seams on the right side behind the pocket have come apart completely and there is a big hole. I'm really disappointed in the quality of this item! Legendary Whitetails refuse to either fix or replace item but offer only 15% on next purchase from them. Horrific customer service, and bad Made in China quality. So if you're looking for a sturdy jacket from a dependable company, this is definitely not it. Other than that it looked good before it fell apart."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Excellent quality,4,Extremely well made and I am very happy with my purchase. My only reason for only 4 stars is that I found the basic shell to be a little lighter (thinner) than I would have liked but I am still very happy with it.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Warm lightweight with deep hand pockets,5,Light weight and warm jacket. With a clean look. It actually has hand pockets too that are deep took a second to find where they are at. I got a large and fits well in the torso with my 6’1” frame but the sleeves are slightly on the short side. Overall a good product
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Good quality Jacket,5,I bought this jacket for my husband who doesn't like to wear heavy coats. He works outside in the 30's to 50 degree temps. This works out perfect for him. He tells me his co workers ask about the jacket a lot.The fabric looks great and the fit is true to size. I have washed it three times now in permeant press and it comes out great.I thinking about buying a second in another color. I recommend this jacket.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Looks nice, but lacking Quality controls !!",1,"Waited for this to arrive and open package, put it on, fit great , looked good...BUT... they forgot to add the sleave snaps.??? not just one but both of them... They may want to invest in some quality controls, prior to shipping... Real pain, now i have to ship it back and should get it in time for summer... Great!!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Legendary Whitetails QC is all over the place,1,"All of their products look really good in pictures, so I finally went ahead and ordered 2 different garments.  Both were very cheap and the sizing was all over the place.  Won't order from them again. I'll stick to the name brands."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great quality attractive shirt,5,"This shirt is rugged, attractive, and high quality, perfect for fall and winter. I usually wear a large or XL,  ordered this in XL and very pleased with the purchase and fit"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great shirt for a mountain man,5,"There's many times that I don't really need a coat, but this shirt also serves as a very warm, wind & rain resistant garment. I received a compliment on it already. If you live in mountain country as I, you will love this shirt jacket."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Size runs small. Strange shiny fabric.,3,Based on the reviews I figured I would love this. Not so much. Size runs small. And it’s made of this strange shiny fabric. They tried to make it sort of look distressed like maybe it’s leather. But it feels cheap. Can’t really describe it. Well packaged. Made in China. But I didn’t like it at all. Sent it back.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,For my son for Christmas,5,This is really a nice shirt jacket.  It was a little pricey but I don't mind paying for quality.  My son really liked it.  I showed him before Christmas so I could exchange if he gave me the thumbs down.  No problems.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,great fitting comfortable and warm,5,"Just wore this to portland for the weekend and it stayed dry and warm.  it doesn't breathe, so managing heat if you're a warm running person is a thing since it doesn't have vents anywhere.  But as a basic, comfortable, warm and nice looking jacket i'm finally happy.  Its not bulky at all.It does run a little big, which was perfect for me, could comfortable wear a tshirt and a flannel shirt beneath it with no issues."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,6'0-6'4 Slim guys GET A LARGE,3,"After reading over a hundred reviews I was mixed on what to order. I am 6'3"" 180 pounds and have problems when I get clothes online. Mediums fight my body perfectly but are always too short on the sleeves, and a large always fits a big baggy for me but are perfect on the sleeves. Since I saw the recommendations and reviews that said to order a size down I figured this would be a perfect fit for me. Unfortunately It came as a true medium and the body actually fit a bit shorter than expected, the sleeves as well were a bit short so now I am switching to a large to see how it fits."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Poorly made,2,"Nice color and fabric, but one big complaint. I ordered two and both had the same problem. Notice how the hem curls under instead of hanging straight. My wife says it's caused by a novice sewing mistake. Dissimilar fabrics must be pre-shrunk before sewing. The shell is 37% polyester, the lining is 100% cotton flannel, so both should have been washed before cutting. That way the lining would not cause the hem to curl under.At the price point of this garment, I would have expected attention to this basic manufacturing standard."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very Comfortable,5,My son LOVES this jacket. He says it's a perfect weight (not too bulky) and keeps you warm. I would recommend a size larger if you plan on layering during frigid winter months. The side pockets are in the perfect spot. Repels rain really well - a good shake after taking it off and it's pretty much dry!
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,The elegant but yet rustic look.,5,"Love the jacket, great look! It has an oiled skin look to it, the lining adds an elegant, yet rustic touch but it’s not very thick. This is a light jacket, so don’t expect to wear it on very cold days, I’d say this jacket should be perfect for 32°-65° weather.I did have one issue upon arrival and it is that the bag that it came in and also the tag attached to the jacket both said XL size but the jacket itself said XXL. That doesn’t change the quality of the product but I was looking forward to wearing it."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Order a dize down and you will be happy.,5,"Great looking fall jacket. I did order a size down, glad i did as it fits great with room for layers. After seeing others complaints about buttons and stitching I checked it immediately and i have no complaint or issues."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,I really love this jacket with one exception...,4,"This jacket is stylish, comfortable and light weight. One of my now favorite jackets for slightly chilly days or wear a hoodie under it for colder days and still look great. The only negative I have to point out was that I noticed the lining of the jacket near the bottom of the pocket was never stitched. At first I thought it was torn, perhaps I caught it on something but upon inspection you could clearly see that it had never been stitched. It's not a deal killer but for the price I would not expect something like that to be overlooked by QA. I had the jacket for over a month so I didn't bother trying to have it replaced. Inspect your garment carefully upon receipt."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great jacket,5,"Love this jacket, I’m 6’ an I ordered a 2x . The sleeves are a bit long as well as the length. I’m sure it will shrink a bit after the first wash then will fit perfectly!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Really Disappointed,2,"Really wanted to love this shirt jacket.  I'm 6'0"" (190 pounds).  I usually take a large, but ordered a medium at the recommendation of the product description.  Found the sizing to be out of proportion (a common complaint for this item).  The upper garment was too big and roomy -- the lower garment was too snug.  The shirt hung lower as a medium than my large shirts.  Really disappointed.  Returned it this morning."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,My Husband Loved it.....,5,"When I received this jacket it was intended to be a Christmas gift, but I had read the reviews that said the sizes run to the large side, and my husband usually wears a 2XL, so I ordered the XL because he has lost a little weight recently.  It was a little snug in the shoulders, it measures 46 inches for the chest.  I gave it to him early because I thought it would be small, it was, and I had to exchange for the 2XL.  All that said, he loved the jacket, loved the material, sort of between leather and cloth, he said he will enjoy wearing it, and is waiting for the replacement, which is supposed to arrive by Dec. 22nd."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Fell short of our expectations for the colder months in The north east,1,This product was purchased for the colder days that we have here in New Hampshire but it turned out that it was more for the spring and fall months so it fell short of our expectations
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Size large is really XL and XL is really XXL, but really nice shirts.",5,"I always wear a size XL, so I ordered the XL. XL was more of a size XXL. So the shrunk this a little by washing it in really hot water and drying it for a long time twice. This ended up being about perfect for a jacket when I'm wearing several layers of clothes such as T-shirt and turtleneck under it. Then I ordered a size large. The size large is about the same as all my other XL shirts. I do like the shirts they look as good as some of the other reviews talk about and even after shrinking the one shirt it still looks good and didn't wrinkle up. I'm happy with the purchases."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Cheap looking and thin,2,"Really thin!!nothing what it looks like in pictures, not worth the 90 bucks..looks like a waterproof plastic sheen, hopefully it gets less pleather looking after washingPros: 6'6 and 2x tall fits"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Very comfortable shirt-jacket, already a favorite.",5,"This shirt-jacket looks great over a t-shirt and with jeans.  I removed the white-tails patch on outer sleeve.  It’s very comfortable and already one of my favorites, will be for years to come.I wish it were made in the US instead of China, but, the quality and fit are excellent for me."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"XL Long is a bit too long, but still ok",5,Great jacket and the XL Long is a bit longer than I expected. This is meant as an overcoat to wear over a hoodie or sweater or whatever so the looseness is ideal however an XL Long fits more like what I'd expect and XXL Long to. I'm 6'1 / 245lbs and the XL would have been a better fit for me.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Head turrner!,5,"As others have said you really have to see it to appreciate how well its made and feels. Even though its a little to cold for this now I can't seem to stop wearing it. The only thing I was a little disappointed with is the tobacco color is way darker than the picture, hopefully as I wash and wear it it will lighten up some. The pocket on the inside is nice and big so it holds my checkbook style wallet and smart phone. If you need a light jacket you should try this one."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,A other great Legendary Whitetail product!!,5,"I’ve had this jacket for a year now. No problems with the snaps, and have not had any tears or stitching as other reviewers have stated.Simply this is a quality lightweight jacket and I have gotten many compliments on its looks.Love Legendary Whitetail products!!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Runs large,3,"Good quality just annoyed by the size. I’m 6’, 178 lbs, 32” waist, athletic build. The large was too large and the medium was too short. If they could nail the size options down It would be great."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Classic style and not an ounce of “flash”.,5,Good quality shirt jacket that I can wear with a hooded sweatshirt and feel plenty warm. And in the early Fall or when it warms up in the Spring just the jacket will do. I like it so much I bought a second color and I’m trying to get the third color but they are out of my size.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Careful with sizing....,2,"I'm 6'4"", 210 pounds.  I'm not thick but I'm not skinny either.  I usually wear a large but with shirts, I find LT to be ideal.  Unfortunately, I was absolutely swimming in this jacket in a LT.  It looked like I was a little kid playing dress up with adult clothing.  Decided to not try another size."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Good quality,5,"Liked the quality and fit.  I'm 6'1"" and 225, and the XXL fit me nicely.  Looks good on me, and I'm not a guy that a lot of things look good on...lol. I do echo some of the other reviews that the hand pockets are positioned too far back, so that you have to reach back to get your hands in there....kinda uncomfortable.  Otherwise I'm happy w/ the purchase."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Really nice shirt!,5,"The tail of this shirt likes to bunch a bit at the seam but it's a nice shirt! Generous cut. Fits comfortably on a 6' 2"" 210 lb guy with broad shoulders.  XL Sleeve length is perfect."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,For evry true adventurer out there,5,"By far the best shirt jacket in every aspect, very comfy to wear, very nice color I apsolutely live the tabacco color, excelent quality and finish. Love it"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,He likes it 😳,5,"They say 3rd times a charm!  Well, in this case, 4 times is a charm.  After buying 3 other jackets, I purchased this jacket for my EXTREMELY picky 26 yr old son.  I'm proud to say WE HAVE A WINNER!! The quality, the fit, the price, everything about this jacket is great!  If you're debating on this one or a different one,  CHOOSE THIS ONE!!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Don’t buy this Chinese crap,2,When I opened the package I realized this was obviously made in China where there is very little quality control. I expected much more for the price. The sleeves are downright creepy feeling.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Fit and function,5,"t's Legendary just as it says on the label. A very personal and secure feeling one has while wearing it. A great collection I own six of them need I say more? Great colors , warm, comfy and fashionable a timeless study in classic elegance."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,A great Coat.,5,"This was not my first choice for a light coat. I tried 4 others and they were either too tight in the arms or too big.  This coat was just right. They tell you that it is roomy and you should order the next size down, but for me that would be a mistake. It’s Rooney enough, the length is just right, and it is warm enough. I’m glad I bought it."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Nice outdoor shirt/jacket.,5,Like the look of a shirt combined with the look of a jacket. Great for camp and general outdoor wear without the bulk of a heavy jacket. Bought me one too liked it that much.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Buy the Carhartt instead,2,This whole thing is cheap and barely cuts the wind. Spend the little bit extra and buy the Carhartt version. They only thing this is good for is giving to the gf so she’ll stop stealing the Carhartts I actually like
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Broken buttons, wide fit.",2,"The fabric is fine, however wo weeks into wearing the jacket, two of the snap buttons have broken. The sleeves and body are far to wide for a slimmer built man like myself. Though it will certainly keep me warm, it makes me look like the Pillsbury dough boy. I wear a medium and the lengths are perfect. It's just extremely wide. Overall, I wished I had kept the tags and gotten a return. Maybe it was just bad luck but I'm not a fan."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Good Fall outer piece.,4,"The item on the site's listing appeared to be an egg-white color, which is what I thought I was getting. It's actually a bit darker, a seeming green and brown mix. Not a deal breaker, just an observation. It's a little stiff, but it's still a good Fall outer piece."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great over shirt jacket,5,"Just purchased my second jacket. I originally purchased this in a large, but found that to be just a tad too small. I am 5'9"" and 180. It make for a great shirt but too fitted for an over jacket. The XL fits perfect for a second layer."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Feels cold,4,It is light-weight and you would think it would be warm. But it seems to draw heat off your body.  Otherwise i love it. But it needs s thin layer of insulation
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Not as expected,1,Not what i expected from the reviews or the price. There’s other better options for the price out there.Update: lasted less then a week and the seams started coming loose.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Returned out of the box,3,"Put it on once and it looked like a colored plastic rain slicker. Ordered the brown and it was not brown, but kinda camo-brown.Sent it back next day. Was very disappointed."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,So perfect!,5,"It's extremely hard to find clothes in tall sizes that fit me.  That being said.  If you're a tall long arm and waisted guy, this jacket is the bomb!  I'm very in love with it.  Can't wait to order another!!!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Nice looking jacket, Fits as expected",5,"I like the looks of the jacket.  It fits as I expected.  I haven't really tested water resistance, but it feels like it would provide at least <some> protection."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,It is a little bigger then you would typically get.,4,"I love this shirt. However, it is a bit big. I ordered an XL and when it came it was like an XXL size. I do not know if they make them this way in order that you would ware a hoodie under it, I am not sure. I went ahead and kept it. However, just make sure that if you expect it to be a certain size that they make these a little bigger then normal."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,The first of many more future purchases from this brand name,5,"Husband is amazed at how warm this shirt is, and material is like nothing else I've felt before, (in a positive way), it looks dressed up yet laid pack and head gotten MANY compliments from the first day he wore it."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Be aware of this seller,1,I was already skeptical after seeing all the reviews about poor quality. I ended up ordering a jacket anyway and received the wrong size...I sent it back and think I will stay away from this seller.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Runs BIG!,5,"I paid attention to the reviews and ordered a L instead of a XL, which I typically am. I am 5'10"" 200lbs and the large fits perfect. I'm only using it as an indoor extra warm shirt. If you are going to use it as a shell with bulky sweaters and sweatshirts under it then order your normal size, if not go one size down."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,would not recommend.,2,"I am a woman with a true hourglass figure and this jacket is definitely tailored and built for men that have a boxy shape.  Shame because I can't find a canvas jacket lined with flannel for women anywhere.  If you are a woman with any curves, would not recommend."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,I should not have ordered a heavy jacket with this,5,"This jacket is plenty heavy enough for the few days of cold here in central Florida.  Yes, there some cold days in Florida.  I love the feel and the rugged look"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Runs small,4,"Jacket seems fine but was small for the size ordered.  Returned with no hassle and ordered the larger size.  Just beware that if you're near the higher end of a size on the chart, go larger."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Nice quality, good fit.",5,"Great quality, lighter weight jacket. If you plan on wearing this over a heavier jacket, go a size up. Otherwise over regular autumn clothing your regular size should fit fine."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Stylish yet rugged.,5,"Bought this for my husband , a contractor always walking job sites. He doesn't like big bulky jackets. He wears this with a flannel underneath and it's just right. Looks stylish yet rugged enough for the job sites. Very happy!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Fits very tight in shoulders and loose in midsection,3,"Looks great on the rack but wasn't the best fit for me.  I've got broad shoulders, average bordering on muscular build.  Typically wear a size Large.  This fits very tight in the shoulders, baggy in the midsection."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Dig it!,5,"I'm 5'11"" 185. Athletic frame and the Large fit me beautifully. The tobacco color is nice and the overall quality is excellent. Liked it so much I got back on and bought my buddy in East Texas one of these. He is  6' 3"" 300lbs and I'm thinking the XXL will get it done. 4th Item I've bought from Leg.Whitetails and they are all of exceptional quality. But for the price I expect it. However, I could've seen this shirtjack going for 90 or better."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great for the money,5,"It looks amazing on my son!! Love the color, you we're out of the original one I wanted(I'm glad now) this one is excellent high quality fabric and very well made want one for my other son"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,i like this shirt,5,"i like this shirt, order normal size, i did,, im 6ft, 210lbs, xltall, and i dont think ill put it in the dryer. i like the way it is now."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,I seriously can’t think of one good thing about this jacket.,1,"It runs way too big and doesn’t fit, it’s really uncomfortable and not warm whatsoever. Really doesn’t look like the picture, the flannel on the inside of mine is some ugly bright orange and the brown on the outside already looks faded"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Another great garment,5,"This is the second purchase of this shirt, although a different color....great with jeans and a tee."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very comfortable,5,Its great for those lightly cool days and evenings...it has a nice weight to it so keeps you warm on those breezy cool says or nights...
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great light jacket!,5,"I have really come to enjoy this light jacket.  I think that it looks great, it's definitely comfortable, and it was a good price.  What's not to like?"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,classic and fit great,5,"Love this item, it is classic, looks sharp and feels comfortable.  made well"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Ran too big for me,3,"Ran too big for me, I normally wear a large and i was swimming in this one.  Also the inside of the sleeves was a sort of satin/nylon.  My arms were immediately cold so I would say the insulation was a bit lacking.  Because of the size issue, I returned this item."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Good jacket for occasional use,4,Was perfect to wear for a week for a trip to Minnesota. But is very light so would not hold up in temps below 40 very well. Quality is disappointing even out of the box there was lots of fraying allong the seams. And after oy a week i had cut off several strands that pulled loose.Its a good choice if you need something once like me (where i live its to hot to ever wear a jacket) and will never wear it again. But if you need something to wear all season look for something else
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Subpar quality,2,The fabric these are made of is great.. The  problem I have is for 80 bucks the stitching is horrible! I bought 3 and all 3 went back for horrible stitching.. I see no longevity in this product
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Nice,4,Don't like the waxy finish but it's not much of a problem
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Made in China junk,2,Seems nice out of the gate but one snap broke the others got really loose only wore it a couple times. too bad seem like a nice shirt. Made in China of course!!
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very nice jacket!,5,Bought this jacket for my better halfs bday gift. It's a Very nice jacket! Made well! Super soft for looking rugged and ruff. Fit the man perfectly! Hes a big burley guy who wears a large. Fits as expected. Cannot wait for him to wear for family photos! Highly recommend!
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Exactly as advertised!,5,"I feel like a true Winchester now! I had to do a good amount of research prior to buying this, due to varying opinions on the fit.  I ended up ordering a Medium, and it fit perfectly.  It runs a bit long; about to the bottom of your front pant pockets.  Super comfortable, with a waxed canvas feel, but lighter."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Cool,5,"Man what a beautiful shirt-jacket, so comfortable and good looking, and I’ve gotten comments from the ladies"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Order your regular size,5,"Got this as a gift for my dad. He's normally an XXL, but because of the reviews and product description saying to order a size down, I ordered the XL. Which was a mistake, I had to exchange for the XXL afterall.The jacket itself is amazing, though. Great quality, plenty of usable pockets, including breast pocket. My dad keeps saying ""this is a NICE coat!"""
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Love the material and the color,5,Fit great and very comfortable. Quality so far feels good and I just love it for daily use
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Ripped on first wear, looks nice tho",1,"It's a nice looking jacket, bought a large for my bro and a medium for myself. I'm 6'3 180 pounds and the medium fit was perfect. I got it Thursday. Havnt worn it yet. First time putting it on and I rip a hole in the armpit. Ridiculous quality, this jacket isn't right on me. Save your money"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Awesome shirt jacket,5,"Love this shirt jacket. It’s durable, comfortable, and warm. It’s my go to when I need another outer layer. It fits a little bit on me but that’s exactly what I wanted."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Stylish and comfortably warm,5,"Great jacket! Wear with a hooded sweat shirt, roomy enough so you can move around  and still stay warm at 40°.  Size 2x"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Sizing off,5,The size is a little off on this jacket. The large was too small and the extra large was too big. My son loves it anyway.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Really great jacket,5,"It fits as expected. Really nice jacket. The arms are not lines with the same material, but that is is okay as I wear a shirt underneath. Great quality and rugged looking."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,A must have for anyone outside,5,"This is the 4the one we’ve purchased and live them.  Keeps us warm, very comfortable and stand up to use."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,A tiny bit small but a beautiful coat.,5,Fits just a tiny bit small. Didn't return because looks incredibly nice unbuttoned so wouldn't actually want larger size. But excellent quality have worn almost everyday.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Not meant for cold weather but looks very nice. You'd think it was oiled leather looking at ...,5,Not meant for cold weather but looks very nice. You'd think it was oiled leather looking at it. Great for 40-50 degree weather though and I'm going to find a natural colored zip up hoodie to wear underneath it for colder temps since it looks so nice. Would definitely recommend for a gift and would buy again.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Fits tight in the shoulders for your size.,3,I ordered the 2X when I really have size XL.  I then took it to alterations to bring down the front.  Fits great now.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Get it!,5,"Ordered this for my husband in extra large...his usual size and it was way to big.  I gave it as a birthday gift to a very tall 6' 4"" friend... it fit perfectly and he was thrilled because he has a hard time getting long shirts.  Got a second one for my husband in large and it fit perfectly.  Its a nice looking, sturdy practical shirt with a great lining...think marlboro man."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Love it.,5,"Love it. Great company. Great quality. Fits perfectly. I’m 6’3, 250. XXL is Perfect. I typically struggle with what sizes to get. Arm leangth is usually an issue, will consider this company again. Their plaid flannels are also a great buy."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Well made good product.,5,Bought one for my Husband and one for my sonthese are the best Shirts their just perfect for a30 degree morning warm but not to heavy .Keeps you dry and want shrink when thereWashed.

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Perfect Christmas gift, someone was extremely happy",5,"This jacket is the ONLY gift my adult son asked for this year at Christmas.  He LOVES it, the fit is perfect (loose enough to add a hoodie during the very cold days, but not so loose that it’s sloppy), the weight is amazing, he opened it and put it on immediately.  I’m not sure he will take it off again for the whole winter."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Well worth the money!,5,"This thing is comfy. I haven't taken it off since I put it on. Right now it's 49 degrees and im snug as a bug.It does run large. I usually wear a large t-shirt, and per other reviews bought a medium. It fits loose enough to put a hoodie underneath comfortably."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,nice. just nice.,5,"I really don't write reviews on clothing, but this takes the prize.  good quality and fit as expected.  excellent quality product and should hold up well on washes.  would order again."

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Top Quality at a reasonable price!,5,"Perfect fit according to size chart, just a little roomy for sweater.  All facets of this garment are top quality.  This item fits so well and is so comfortable I never want to take it off.  Good in cold and moderate weather.  I HIGHLY recommend."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Pretty Great, but Weird Pocket Placement",4,"This simple jacket is exactly what I was looking for. It blocks the wind without being too heavy, looks great in a variety of settings, and seems durable enough to last decades. When worn open it looks like a jacket. But unlike many jackets I've owned, it looks casual and neat when buttoned. The only thing that bothers me a bit is that the side hand-warming pockets feel a little far back. I'm sure in time I'll adjust, and it's a small complaint (I can still reach them comfortably, after all) with an otherwise great item."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Light jacket for casual wear.,4,"Light jacket. Good for casual wear. Not durable enough for hunting or to use for construction or where you’ll need a heavier and durable outer garment.  But, it is a nice jacket. I get complements on it all the time."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Rugged shirt/jacket,5,Really nice shirt/jacket. These run large so go a size down of what you normally wear. 5’10 180 and I got a medium. Was a little big but I washed it in warm and dried it on medium heat. Fits perfect.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great with weird pockets,4,I really like the jacket. Only reason i am knocking off a star is the very weird pockets placement. They are place far back on the jack almost making them useless.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Well made.,5,Tailored for an American man.  Arm holes and shoulders are the proper size.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,It's awesome.,5,My husband loves this jacket. He says it's warm to wear. He loves the color.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great item,5,Husband really likes this item.  Has worn several times so far.  Made well.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,I Love It,5,I love this jacket. Many compliments. Excellent quality and construction.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very much undersized...,3,"I can buy XXL all day long in any coat, jacket shirt, and XXL will be just that Extra Extra Large. This is a small XL if you buy go another size up to have it fit properly."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,EXCEPTIONAL PURCHASE,5,"Bought this jacket for a gift.  When I opened the box, I was blown away.  It is different and beautifully rugged.  My husband said ""I want one for me"". We purchased a large because of other reviews....the person it's for would normally wear an X-large in a jacket.  My husband,  that is XX-large tried it on and said Large would work for our friend.  I will purchase X-large for my hubby because of his barrel chest and 6'3 frame.  Hopefully, our friend will love this as much as we do."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Shop around a bit more before you pull the trigger,3,"Comfortable.  Unfortunately the flannel does not run the full length of the sleeve, I feel like it would be warmer if this was the case.  Lighter than I had wished, but still a descent jacket.  Inner pocket stitching is a little weak and tore slightly the other day while opening the pocket. Overall not disappointed terribly"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Looks nice but unsuitable.,2,Looks nice but i can not button it and the side pockets are too far back on the under arm seam. This shirt is for skinny people.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Very nice,5,My husband really liked this. Nice thickness and very nice looking
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Don’t do it,3,This product is cheap and definitely not quality crafted many loose threads very few double stitched stress areas the snaps open way too easily I’m going to return it it looks good but you can’t tell a book by its cover
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Love the shirts wear them all the time pricey but awesome,5,Love the shirts wear them all the time pricey but awesome
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Watch the size.,2,"Size was stated as made big to handle wearing layers. I found it not quite so. Arms are too long, the chest size is OK but I don't fine the room around the gut I expected. The size is not made for big guys of otherwise normal hight.  Love the color."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great jacket,5,Worth the price full lining smooth texture denim sheds water. Good pockets and fit
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Runs rather large,3,"Seems like a nice heavy-weight shirt/light jacket.  But the large is way too big and the small was of course too small.  Medium would have worked for me (which is unusual) - and of course they were out of that size, so I had to return it."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Nice look,5,Much better the second time around. Fits loosely enough to put another layer on underneath.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Durable lightweight jacket,5,"This became my new favorite lightweight jacket.  I'm an Electrical Contractor and I wore this jacket all winter, every day.  It took some abuse and it held up wonderfully.  No problems with snaps or seams at all.  It's a great lightweight jacket that is comfortable and looks good too.  (Note:  Winters in California are mild)."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Awesome jacket, but runs large",5,"This jacket is good for cooler weather in fall because the material is highly wind resistant. It's also comfortable and looks great!The only trouble is that it tends to run large. As a solid medium normally (with nothing heavy underneath), but had to return this and get a small instead. Going down one size made all the difference for me, and I love this jacket."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Little baggy but nice,5,"I like the deep side pockets, the way they're shaped keeps stuff from falling out. I like the jacket all around.I do wish they had a size in extra small, the small runs a little big but it's not bad, just heads up that the small is not slim.  Should keep and my dog warm same time lol."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Jacket, yes. Shirt jacket? No.",3,"Not a shirt jacket, simply a jacket. Not soft, more of a waxed feel"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Awesome!!,5,"Awesome shirt jacket that I consistently get compliments on. All the seams appear to be very sturdy, the buttons are high quality, and it is just warm enough to cut the chill and not make me want to bust out in sweat.FYI: I'm 6'6"" and ordered one of the ""tall"" sizes, I could have easily gotten away with a normal, order a tall if you want a shirt-jac that you can tuck in, otherwise it is unnecessary."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Great jack for anytime of the year.,5,Love it.  Nice relaxed fit but holds its' shape great. Light but it will keep you warm on the brisk days yet good for the summers.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Looks cool,5,"It won't keep you very warm, but its built strong and looks good. I would not recommend for weather under 50 degrees though"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Comfy,5,Excellent jacket!  Great pockets for carrying tools.  A great jacket for low profile ccw
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Fit,1,"too large for my choice of fit, not true to sixe. I returned it."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Design Flaw,2,"Don't buy this jacket! I love the look, the feel, the quality of the material, and the warmth level. But, there is a serious design flaw in the jacket. The pocket zipper bottoms sit above the rest of the material and take all of the weight of your hands when you have your hands in the pocket. I am sending back my second jacket for return, even though I'd love to keep it. Both times, the zippers bust in the first few days due to the strain of normal wear. At first I tried to repair the zipper,on but then learned that no zipper could be successful sewed in the way it is. If the pocket zippers are not important, maybe you will love the jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,BUY IT BEFORE THEY DOUBLE THE PRICE,5,"The jacket does the chin guard well, the cuffs are solid and the attention to detail is superb.  The lining is there!!  I am used to a softshell with less warmth.  This jacket is best served with a layering system planned with this being a layer to provide some warmth.  I have a softshell that was easily twice the cost and certainly does not meet the standard of value this jacket presents.  So while I was taken sideways by how warm the lining can be, this is my own assumption and failure to pay attention to detail when ordering, not a fault I hold against the jacket.  So where are the super tiny flaws? or super tiny details done right?The cuffs are the easiest place on this jacket to find the smallest pros and cons on an otherwise AMAZING value proposition.The velcro on the cuff is great quality.  The hook and loop sides both are done spectacularly well.  On some jackets the ribbon base on the loop side of the velcro can be placed to far to the edge of the cuff presenting an abrasive edge to wear on your hands/wrists.  Not so on this jacket.  The spacing is superb.The hook side can have issues such as scratchy hooks, aggressive ribbon base under the hook velcro or other issues that create scratching and abrasions.  Not on this jacket.  They use a hook section that is a rubbery material with hooks that are more like little triangle tree stumps so nothing feels scratchy or abrasive at all.  The rubbery material has a friction grip feel on the back side so you can get some grip in the rain or cold, and the edges are smoothed over or rounded.The cuffs are where the issue of this jacket exists though, the small small issue.  The lack of internal elastic or section of elastic.  Basically the cuff is all fabric tube with velcro to seize it down for warmth or to close aorund your gloves during a snow covered wrestling match or w/e.  In some other jackets the sleeve would compensate for this adjustability with a touch of elasticity, and I know why.With this jacket if you cinch down witht he velcro then you may have to uncinch the velcro to get your hand back through the sleeve.  Therefore for a better day to day fit in the sleeve you would need to velcro both sleeves getting into the jacket then both getting out of the jacket.  Every time.  This of course is not reality and you can have them cinched down but not fully and slip your hand in and out, leaving the velcro where it is, and only need to adjust it if you want to cinch down the cuff completely.I know this is a very small nitpick more than a flaw, but I think if I point it out then you can understand the level of criticism I can bring to a jacket and to see this is the only thing to nitpick means the jacket for the price is an insane value proposition. They could definitely sell this jacket for double the price and still have great ratings and reviews.  It is an incredible jacket and value."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Looks great, I’m hesitant about the quality.",3,"I love the fabric and the collar height on the jacket. I’m 5’11” 235lbs and all the weight is in my stomach. (I’m working on it) that being said the jacket fits pretty good, a tad tight around my stomach but that’s on me. I ordered an XL, I felt and still do feel that an xxl would swallow me. That being said my critiques have nothing to do with sizing and everything to do with quality. Within a couple wears (not my everyday jacket) the zippers in the pockets stopped working, and the pulls for all the zippers except the large bottom to top zipper had come undone. I’ve not washed it yet, but I’m kind of afraid to. If you need a nice looking jacket for a job interview or your quarterly sales meeting, this will do great. If you need a nice looking jacket to wear everyday, I’d maybe look elsewhere."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Nice jacket with aweful zippers,2,"This jacket has it's ups and downs.Up: it’s comfortable, good wind and rain resistance, and looks pretty classy.Down: the zippers!!!!  The main zipper up the front is functional, but feels like it won’t last long.  Just too sticky to give much confidence that it will last.  The pocket zippers are no better.  One of them broke after less than a month, and the zipper pockets are otherwise a nice selling feature for me.I would gladly pay a little more to get quality zippers on this jacket, and would be likely to give it 5 stars then.  As it is, a jacket that won’t zip does not really serve its purpose."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great details and quality for the price.,5,"6’2” 230 lbs, 36 inch waist, 34 inch inseam - XL purchased. Fits well, bought XL to go over a fleece and it worked well. If you plan on wearing over a sweater only, or less you may fit into a L.Really good quality and great features at this price. Small things like zipper pulls, pocket lining, and trim matter to me and if they do to you you will like this jacket. It is warm and a good all-around jacket. Cut short enough that I can wear it in the car and it does not ride up. Looks cool in black."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Near perfect winter jacket.,5,"Fits perfectly - wear for both winter running and casual wear in NYC.I'm 5'8 and currently 180 (was 200 earlier when I ordered) and the medium fits perfectly at both sizes. Blocks the wind effectively, so even in colder temps, if I'm wearing a wool sweater underneath I'm plenty warm. In the rain, the outer shell will get wet, but that doesn't pass through to the inside. Snow just blows off. Chest zip pocket is perfectly sized for larger smartphones (iPhone 7+ here)."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Decent, falls short in the details",3,"I'd say 3.5 if I could.  For $35 - this jacket is surprisingly good. The fit worked well for me and I was surprised by the overall feel of the jacket - I would've expected to pay more for what I received.Why 3 stars?  The zippers on the side pockets are susceptible to coming off the tracks at the bottom of the pocket - so if you have your hands in the pockets, the zippers can pop off one of the tracks and leave you unable to zip your pocket at all until you fix them.  Of course, the jacket will still keep you warm (and so will the pockets) - but the zipper problem has frustrated me quite a bit and left me regretting my purchase.  It feels like a silly place for this jacket to fall flat considering everything it does right.Will everyone feel that way?  Probably not, so it you don't think you would don't let my review deter you.  It just happens to bug me!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great product by Amazon essentials,5,"Great product by Amazon essentials, I remember hesitating because of the previous reviews.I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good soft shell jacket. Not only does is it look good but repell water effectively which is something I was surprised about.The only complaint I have was about the quality of the zippers, mine in the right pocket is broken. But I think it deserves 5 stars because of what your getting for a low price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great jacket but consider going a size up,5,"For context I am 6ft3in 220lbs. This is a great medium jacket, the outer shell is exactly the texture I desired and resists wind even better than expected(live near the beach in VA so it's often windy). The liner is comfy and at first I was a little thrown by the mesh on the back with fleece lining the arms vs fleece throughout but realize it breathes better like this.Build quality and fabric is spot on.Ok, now for the cons. Sizing--I usually buy things in XL and I'm good but when this arrived even though I saw that I was within the specs on the sizing chart it was way too short and a little snug in the chest. The shell does not stretch like cotton so even after a few days of wearing it in the car and such it was obvious I had to change out for a XXL. The XXL arrived and it sizing is pretty much perfect save for having to tighten the cuffs slightly and tighten the waist bungee just a little to keep the back from sticking out off my butt.Some things I'd wish it had were inside pockets, all my other jackets have these and I like putting my wallet there vs back pocket now.Overall highly recommended but consider going a size up. In retrospect, I could have gotten both the XL and XXL on prime wardrobe and tried them both on like that and only paid for the one I kept and might recommend the same for others to be sure you get the right one."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,A great soft shell jacket for a good price.,5,"Honestly surprised by the quality of the item so far. I recently lost a North Face soft shell jacket similar in style, but didn’t want to spend another $180 to replace it. A friend of mine recommended I try this Amazon branded soft shell, with the added benefit of an inner liner.When I removed this from the packaging, I was surprised at the overall build and the quality of the item. While I’ve used this only a weeks worth of time, it’s quickly become my go to jacket. It’s comfortable, has zip up pockets, and has the added warmth of the inner liner."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Boxy,4,"I am not a large man. I'm not slender. I'm... a tad soggy, as they say.  5'9"" and around 195, with 33 in waist, and probably 36 in pooch. Used to be athletic, then life and donuts happened. Lean more towards the pear-shaped man, rather than apple-shaped. Apparently that's better in terms of risk for diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension, but good god, the thunder thighs. I digress.Anyways, this jacket (I got a medium) unfortunately didn't work for me. It's a bit big just below the chest. Helpful if I had large breasts. I'm a guy, and I do not, so it's wasted space, which is kinda awkward. The sleeves are a little long. The seams are a bit bulky. The chest pocket is a bit large and low. Great for stowing away sandwiches, but a little overkill for the phones.It's unfortunate, because for all of Amazon Essentials jackets, they seem a bit too baggy between the chest and waist. If you're more of an apple with a larger belly, then this'll probably work better for you than it did for me.Otherwise love the color and expedient delivery and potential!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Comfortable, well made, and water resistant - yes, please",5,"I absolutely love this all-weather jacket from Amazon Essentials! The fit, comfort, and style all speak to a quality made product without all the extra fuss of a designer name, nor the extra price either. The breast zippered pocket is perfect for a normal sized cellphone (sorry, haven't tried to uber large phablets yet) and allows easy access while out and about. The two side pockets are the perfect depth and positioning for your hands or a set of keys without worry that they may fall out. They are also zippered, in case you want to ensure what's in your pockets, stays in your pockets.The fabric is similar to, but much lighter than, the neoprene like material that is used in wet suits. It is very comfortable, does not get stuffy, and appears to keep a light rain off just fine. Zipped up it also keeps the cold away enough in a light breeze, but probably isn't ideal for winter wear.Overall, for a product made for Amazon directly, I am very impressed with the quality and design of this lightweight, water-resistant jacket. If you are in the market for a stylish, affordable jacket, then you need look no further."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Great quality. Keeps me dry and warm, but not too warm.",4,"I purchased this coat for the awkward spring that we had this year in which we had 70-degree days, rain, and snow storms all in the same week. I normally don’t buy retail brands, especially for clothing, but Amazon Essentials knocked it out of the park with this coat. It was actually just a tad bit heavier than I thought it was going to be. This was also my first waterproof coat; so, I didn’t know what type of material to expect. The coat looks great, feels great, and seems to be of great quality. I used it for a solid two months with no issues. It wasn’t too warm on warmer days, and it kept me more than warm enough on cold days. The waterproof material was also fantastic. Water beads up on the surface and can be shaken or brushed right off.My only minor complaint is that the collar is a bit oddly shaped and the ends of it stick out way too far when you don't keep them flat against your chest. That's just my opinion based on personal preference, though.I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap, all-purpose coat to keep them warm and dry."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Bad Sleeves. Bad Waist.,2,"First, this was a very affordable jacket. And it was advertised as grey - it is. For these two things I give it credit.I have  4 problems with this jacket.1. The sleeves are shore. The sleeves are awkwardly large at the wrists. The velcro on the wrists is awkwardly placed and when used causes odd bunching at the cuffs. When you put your hands in your pockets the sleeves roll back onto your forearm.2. The waist is very large and open and does not close well using the draw string - so you're always getting an ""updraft"".3. One side of the collar eternally stands up and pokes me in the chin - while the other side lies very flat.4. No interior pockets.Wouldn't buy again."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great jacket for monogramming,5,I was hesitant to order this jacket because I have used other brands I’ve been happy with. I really wanted a jacket with the chest pocket and with the ability to have it monogrammed. I am absolutely pleased with the jacket. It is fleece lined interior and waterproof soft exterior. Most jackets with the chest pocket are too high and prevent you from being able to monogram the jacket but this one is perfect. The zippers seem sturdy and function without any difficulties on my jacket. Obviously it’s summertime and haven’t been able to wear it that often but so far I am very pleased with the purchase. The jacket took the monogramming on both left and right chest area and looks great. Very happy with my purchase and will definitely buy again in the future.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,its just been alright,3,"There is a lot to enjoy about this jacket. The only real issue i have is that the zippers failed quickly. I have tried to zip up my pockets only a few times, and the zippers came right off, easily and when i needed them to work because it just started raining in San Diego.  It doesn't rain often here, so this being the only rain jacket i have i'm a tad disappointed."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Better than expected,5,"It took a bit to get this jacket delivered, and after getting the missing box I tried it on. This jacket is quite impressive, since it is heavy duty. I've ordered the men's small in the Goodthread's & Essentials shirts, which fit like a true small. This jacket, was ordered in a size small and has extra room to be able to layer bulky sweaters underneath which creates versatility. If you plan to layer, order your size. The sleeves are quite long, more like a 34"" length, but the velcro closure makes it easy to adjust the length. The fabric on the inside is like a thin fleece, & the outside feels like a thin wetsuit. It feels heavy when grabbing it, but it goes on nicely without having to adjust it on the shoulders. The sleeves have movement without restricting the arms. There are 3 pockets all with zippers, one above the heart & the other 2 are side pockets. The Blue jacket was nicer in person, and got compliments right away. It was comfortable in 60 degree weather without being too hot. I'd say this jacket is good for 3 reasons, and is quite comfortable. I'd recommend this jacket, since it has a great price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Gets the job done,4,"If I could, I’d give this a 3.5 out of 5. This jacket came exactly as advertised. One of the things that makes it lose a Star is my left zipper came “unthreaded” some how. I don’t excessively fiddle with zippers or anything so this particular jacket probably slipped through quality control.I truly appreciate that it’s unbranded, without any visible indication that I received this from amazon.It has great build overall but fits kind of large and a bit lengthy on be arms. The jacket is also stiffer than I’d like but this is probably due to the fabric. Some threads along my right cuff sleeve are also coming apart and I’ve only washed this once since my purchase less than approximately a month ago.I understand that this product is “an essential” but it isn’t extraordinary or made nicer than the left. After purchasing this at $35, I believe the price should be closer to 35 but that’s just my opinion."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Surprisingly Well Made,4,"I hate spending money on cloths, period.  Needed a shell jacket that wouldn't cost $100 or more (and they can get waaaay up there), and stumbled on this dealio.  Jacket fits really well, zipper functions nicely, chest pocket, etc...pretty much what you need, but no high end brand logo on the chest.  More colors would have been nice, but I'm not complaining.  Only pseudo gripe, the collar simply won't stay down, it's like anti-gravity or something."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Weird fit, as in many Amazon Essentials products",3,"The thing I don’t understand about Amz Essentials stuff this “boxy” fit. I keep running into the same issue with their jackets and hoodies. I get XL and it fits great in chest and shoulders, but it’s loose in the waist. If I go size smaller, I get the waist waist right, but the shoulders are too snug. Seems like they do not know how to taper their stuff just a bit so as to achieve the right fit.Same story with this very jacket. Such a great potential otherwise, good materials and all.. if only it didn’t fit like a square."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great price for a decent jacket,4,"I'm 6'1"" (190 lbs) and I ordered the large.  Needed a waterproof jacket for a trip - this worked out great and I use it all the time.  The pocket zippers broke within the first couple of weeks, which is too bad because the pockets are big enough to hold an iPhone 7 plus and still zip up with space.  It's easy to machine wash and dry.  The arms are nice and long for my orangutan arms, without the torso being too long.  The material isn't the nicest but it keeps the water and wind off you - and you won't be disappointed about the value for the price!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Surprised by the quality. Excellent jacket.,5,"After reading several other reviews, I decided to purchase this jacket. I needed something I could wear in the fall or on a “warmer” winter day that didn’t have logos or other markings on it. I have a $90 Adidas jacket that’s almost identical, but because of the logo, I had to find an alternative option. This jacket actually outperforms my Adidas in comfort and style and was 1/3 of the price. I’ve even had 2 co-workers purchase these from Amazon since they’ve seen me in it. Great buy and I highly recommend."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great Jacket- for Casual or Business Wear.,5,"Ordered a 2 XL for my husband who is 6'5"", 260lbs and it fits perfectly. The sleeves are long enough (37ins.). The jacket is somewhat lightweight but nice and neat looking.  Perfect jacket for all occasions.  Can be worn with casual clothes or with business dress slacks, dress shirt and tie. The material is light rain waterproof and seems like it would protect from wind fairly well. It has Velcro sleeve adjusters at the wrists and a pull string at the collar that hides when the collar if folded over. Overall, I am very impressed with this jacket. My husband is happy too."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Huge sleeves!!,2,Sleeves are pretty big!! I have other soft shell jackets that feel more fitted. I’m a pretty big dude (6ft 210lbs )but the size Large was too big for me. Didn’t really dig the batwing feeling I got so I returned the product. Maybe if they slimmed those sleeves down I would have kept it!! But I think a medium would have fit me better lol even tho I never wear mediums anything.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Product review,4,"Very nicely made jacket, but I also just got it. It’s way to big. I say that a medium is about a large in normal US sizes. So I’ll be returning it for a smaller one. But the material is very nice. Definitely be warm on a mid winter day. Might even be decent in snow. It’s just alil to heavy for a jacket but I’d rather be warm then cold. I’m using it for my job only so time will tell."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great Job Amazon but ...,4,"really loving the look and feel if this jacket. agree with other positive reviews  fyi 5'7 160 40 chest, medium fits perfectly!wore it for 2 days... really warm and comfortable. my main deal breaker is that the right collar doesnt lay flat and i can see the corner out of the corner of my eye and feel it on your chin; botj are distracting.This is possibly due to construction of the zipper. hoping the replacement is better. ❤️ amazon"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Looks awesome, butfeels like armor",4,Awesome looking but it feels like wet suit material or something. Maybe good for riding a motorcycle incase of an accident? . It's pretty stiff idk but  its definitely not good for us.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Just a jacket.,3,"It is what it is. Decent quality for the price.Pros:Nice pockets, two by the waste and one at breast height, perfect size for a cell phone or wallet.Cons:I’m pretty skinny but I thought the sleeves were a little baggy compared to the overall size of the jacket, but really not too bad.Don’t wear around a campfire, you’ll never get this weird plastic-y smokey smell out once you are around wood smoke. Don’t like the smell and I can notice it while wearing but it’s not too pungent.Overall it’s a pretty good jacket for the price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Weirdly baggy sleeves,3,"I really wanted to like this jacket.  The price point was great, the styling looked good.  When it arrived though... Torso fit was good, I have wide shoulders and it sat nicely on them... but the arms seemed cut for a size or two larger, it just makes an awkward look, not at all the slim fitted look I was expecting.  Disappointing and will probably return."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Warm Inexpensive Coat,4,I live in Texas and needed an inexpensive coat for Winter. I bought this thinking it would be light and still warm enough for 30-40 degree weather. It does a great job. I like the jacket. It fits me good. I'm 6'4 and I bought the XL. I'm not fond of the straps on the end of the arms but it's a minor flaw.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Nice look but construction is not good,3,"I bought this jacket for the minimal look and price about a month ago. But as other have noted, the construction is not very good. Less than a week after wearing it, the zippers on the pockets came off track and no longer work. Also, the jacket is a little bulkier than I expected, especially when I have something in my pockets. But I still like the color and it is warm and it held up in the rain.  I will still wear it since I paid for it, but would not buy again or be quick to recommend. Worth it to shop around for other brands on sale or pay a few extra bucks to get better quality."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great Jacket! Just what I expected and needed!,5,"This jacket is exactly what I wanted. I've had it for about a week with no issues. Washed it about 3 times just due to my clumsiness/spills and its held up! I haven't had the zipper issue that some have had. Wore it on very windy ~45 degree days and it was perfect, especially at keeping the wind out. This will be my go-to spring/fall jacket! It fits true to size but is just a tiny tiny bit tight at the bottom. I definitely won't need to sinch it up at all. Love it!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Fantastic basic jacket,5,"Fantastic basic jacket. bought it as a christmas gift for a friend. They just wanted something flat and black to be able to wear to anything. This fit the bill, there is no flourishes, no fancy zippers, no reflective crapo on the collar. it is just a plain back jacket that is true to size and fits well. Comparable stuff from macys and jcpenny was going for like 60 bucks so i was happy to find this through amazon for only 35. My only gripe would be the amazon essentials logo...it is just a tab bit tacky looking"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Amazing quality and water resistant perfect for work and regular wear.,5,"I loved it it’s soft high quality material water resistant, it’s perfect! I bought this because in my school we are not allowed to have hoodied sweaters or jackets for safety reasons and I didn’t have anything without a hoodie that fit so I decided to go on amazon where I usually get all my stuff from and found this one to try out best one yet!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great jacket,5,"Water resistant for sure, not water proof.  Warm and fits great.  I think my favorite thing about this jacket is how simple it is and the fact Amazon sells it.  The customer service with the defective jacket was way better than any customer service I've ever had.  The first jacket had a zipper issue and they corrected it in 2 days with a replacement at my door.  I'm honelsty thinking of just buying my cloth from Amazon because it's cheaper and it fits great."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"The features, fit and price make this item a real hit with me.",5,"I am a little shorter than the model in the product photo, but the jacket is a favorite apparel item of mine. The fit is nearly tailor-made. My office is kept very cold (probably 58 degrees F, but it feels like 50), and this jacket is thick enough to keep me warm and allows me to move about at my desk comfortably. Three zipper pockets are nicely located and of ample size (all appear to have the same capacity)."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Everything except the velcro,4,The jacket fit well and has been very comfortable. Keeps the wind and water out while looking good. Velcro at cuffs gave out after a couple months. I didn't release and reattach often as I kept it loose enough I could slip my arms out without releasing it.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Great Materials, slightly too short",5,"The quality of the materials is basically the same as clothing that is much more expensive. When I wore it to work, they wanted to know which NorthFace jacket it was. The length was a tad too short, I'm 6'3. The length of arms is good."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,A great fit for your boxy or cylindrical body,3,"The materials and construction seem decent - it's an amazing value for a power fleece, superficially...  but...  it doesn't fit very well.  It's baggy everywhere but in the shoulders.  It looks and feels sloppy.If you want to see what a good fit can do, try on an arcterix.  That's an amazing fit."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Fits right and use it for work,5,I have had same kind of jacket from another brand and was looking for same but different color. This fits perfectely to my need. I wear this jacket to work instead of sweater. Looks rich and neat! Plus its waterproof.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Great price, great jacket!",5,"Was looking for a good quality softshell jacket for rainy fall weather and I am pretty sure I have found just what I was looking for!  Great fit, seems to be great quality. I have not noticed any issues with the zippers yet, but I have only had it for a week or two.  I am 5'10"", 190 lbs and ordered the Large."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Surprisingly great looking and solid quality!,5,This is a great light weight jacket with warmth for Autumn or layering with for cold winters. The quality is very good. I have received several compliments. I must say it looks better than the pictures.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great bang for your buck,4,"I got another brand that is very similar and was $120, this was a steal in comparison. This has awesome value, Its warm enough for a light weigh soft shell.  Fits great. Looks good. Resists water well. Ran through the wash with no problem. But Needs Inside pockets, not a single one. Cant beat the price though, buy one before their gone or they raise the price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Effective and Stylish,5,This jacket is stylish and warm enough to wear in the cold. I had it on in 30 degree temp for short period with a slight wind and I was fine. As for size  I'm 5'10 215 and the XL fits perfect. For the price you really can't go wrong. The material is identical to my sons North Face. The jacket closely resembles Columbia's water- resistant  coat
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Great fit, comfortable.  A couple of minor designer defects.",4,"Great fit, comfortable.  A couple of minor designer defects.I really like this and will continue to wear. If it's well and keeps me warm under the circumstances. It travels well also.A couple of things to know: the Velcro on the arm seems to wear out. Strap doesn't close like it used to. Also I do wish it had a pocket on the inside.Overall you can't beat the price and the quality"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Light weight and comfortable,5,"I needed a jacket that would fill in the transition from cold weather parka to ""no jacket"" weather. This jacket does the job perfectly. I've only used it for a month but, at the price I paid, even if it only lasts a couple of year's I'll be happy. So far it looks sharp!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,WHAT A GREAT JACKET!,5,"I know this jacket is probably not bad looking, but until I got it, I never expect it to be so nice looking.The jacket itself is quite impressive, material, cut, and functionality.I'm buying another one for my father, this is an amazing jacket.I'll recommend anyone who wants a reasonable price good looking featured jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great jacket,4,"The jacket fits well and looks nice. Although the wrist strap is a bit uncomfortable, when you are tightening the straps, it forms a loop that constantly rubs against your wrist. Another thing is when you raise your arms, the whole jacket lifts up as well, you basically end up showing your belly. The material is nice, waterproof for sure, my only wish is that it had a hood. It does come with pockets and I'm not talking about the one you see on the chest. Also the jacket is very stylish and the padding provides comfort. Overall it's a great jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Amazing jacket, great buy",5,"The jacket is amazing, I have now worn it more than 20 times and have used all the zippers 20 times and none of the zippers have a broken. Write a lot of complaints about the zipper, nothing happened with mine, and I've used them all more than 20 times there are still intact working just fine. Overall the jacket is amazing, the collar could have been a little shorter but if you take one second and folded it looks fine. The length is just perfect, the waist is just perfect, the inside of the jacket is a clothy wool material. Great jacket, this was a good purchase."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Solid choice with no heavy branding,5,"Really liked this one.It’s not as dark a black as the Columbia softshell, but for the price I really can’t complain.It fits well, looks sharp, and has great sleeves that are long enough for a fairly tall guy (6’4), but without being too wide or baggy.Definitely impressed."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Perfect Work Jacket,5,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. Now, months later, he is pleased with the quality and fit. It has washed well and is water-resistant and a good windbreaker.  It works as a wear-to-work piece as well as for casual dress.He recommends wearing it as a fall/spring jacket, so when the weather is between 40-60 degrees F."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,This jacket is made with good materials. However,3,"This jacket is made with good materials. However, its arm dimensions are just crazy big. To put things into perspective, I grabbed a medium, I’m 5 9” and weight 168 lbs. Length and shoulder wise fits perfectly, but there is so much rooms in the arms I could probably fit twice or more on each one (and I work out). It just doesn’t look good and carrying all that extra arm space is not too confortable."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Keeps you warm in cold weather (like above freezing),5,Comfortable and good looking jacket.  It can get warm if temp is above 55.  Collar rides up but I like it as it keeps your neck warm.  I wish it had an inside zipper pocket.  I have 46” waist and I had room for a light vest.  Sheds water well.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,A solid coat for the price,5,"This is a really nice coat for the price.  It has a fleece-lined collar, well stitched zippers, and is heavy enough to wear as a ""light winter jacket"" with an additional sweatshirt underneath.  I'm 6' 170 lbs, and a medium fit me perfectly.  This is a solid alternative to spending $100+ on a soft-shell North Face or Columbia jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great Value,5,"Purchased this for my dad. He's an XL and the XL fit perfectly! Very flattering fit, not bulky. VERY comparable with my Columbia jacket that costs at least 2x the price on sale! Fleece lined, sturdy zipper, nice color. Zippered pockets for security. He loves the jacket, and when my Columbia needs replacing, this is what I'll be getting!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Has a few dealbreakers,3,"It's definitely a warm jacket, not for summer days. Few design issues which made me not like the jacket:- The cloth lining under the zip sticks out too much, which makes the jacket uneven and awkward when not zipped up.- The lining also makes the collar stick out far from the body.- The velcro at the cuffs are good quality, but make it crumple in a weird way. As the material is stiff, it tends to poke your arm.- Keeping hands in the side pockets puts all the weight on the zippers."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,As advertised,5,"I’m 5’7” 170 lbs, and the large fit perfectly. The bottom of the jacket is also perfect, without the need of the elastic hem.  It’s a quality jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Super buy,5,"Smart looking, well made jacket. Repels water and keeps you warm. Only complaint is that the velcro straps on the wrists don't stay down. I had to tack mine down with thread, which disables my ability to tighten them for warmth. It was better then having these to flaps sticking out like wings."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great value 0,5,"Pleasantly surprised that this inexpensive item is perfect for me. Not to warm, just perfect for ewinter weather in S. FL, 40 degrees."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Good quality, as usual you get what you expect.",5,"Great quality, very comfortable and moderately warm. Exactly as expected. I saw some comments on here complaining about the zippers. It was tough to undo the zipper when I pulled it out of the package but after that I had no issues. The material is nice and dense and should be pretty water resistant.The fit was good as well. I am 6 foot 160 lbs and the jacket fit great."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,I like it!,5,Not sure about longevity or zippers after a few months but it's a nice Florida lightweight yet warm jacket. Repels rain decently. Doesn't look cheap.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Nice jacket,5,"This jacket looks to be well made. The generous pockets are nice. I can't say about the water resistance, we've been in a drought here since fall, so I haven't worn it in rainy conditions. It works well for the weather I had in mind when I bought it, which is cool, but not really cold days."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Really great mid-weight jacket.,5,"I like every thing about this jacket, and we had a cold front where I found out it was a really good weight for any thing other than very cold weather.  The velcro fastening at the wrists, and the cord at the waist are great features.  Great Jacket!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Excellent for fall weather and looks great,5,This jacket beat my expectations.  It is not only warm and comfortable but looks really nice.  Great value and quality for the price
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great buy. This jacket is light but very warm. Also great on a rainy day,5,Love this light weight yet warm jacket. Extra pocket for is great. Order for our show team jackets
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Only okay,2,"The fit is perfect, but the material is a little weird. Where if folds (like on elbows) the material has tiny waves like the outer layer is separating from the inner layer or something. Since it was a gift I wish I had just spent more on name brand."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Nice look 3 zipped pockets what I wanted,5,Three zipped pockets I wanted zippers. Fits snug looks great. Maybe too warm wear indoors but looks great
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Worth it,5,"It fits just right in all the right places, it really does it’s job. I walked about a mile in 15 degrees weather and my top was not cold at all! Wore this in the rain and completely dry. For the price it really gets the job done. Great gift for the fall or winter"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Just like the name brand one but less expensive,5,"Fit and was as expected. For the price, just like the name brand except slightly less fleece material inside. Has a weave-type liner that would be good in Spring and Fall."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Slightly bigger than expected (XL),4,"I bought an XL ... so ... I really can't complain.  XL is XL ... I wish it was a better fit, but if I was a little smaller I think an large would be perfect."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Love it,4,I love this I just wish it came with a hood and there is a hooded version out there but it's 20 bucks extra which seems silly for just an extra piece of clothing.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great rain jacket!,5,"Great lightweight, windproof rain jacket.  I wear this as the outer shell for a 3 piece layering system and it works great.  It keeps the wind out and it repels water.  I've worn it in light rain showers with no issues.  Haven't had the chance to wear it in a down pour."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Excellent value for price,5,"Feels quality, have only worn a few times since purchasing, but zero complaints for the price. Excellent."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Really Generic,2,It’s an odd jacket. The reviews about the collar being big are true. It sticks pretty far out ahead of you when unzipped. Maybe the material can be tamed through time. It is really warm. It doesn’t breathe at all.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Poor quality zippers,2,"While I initially liked the jacket and it fit as expected, the zippers are poor quality. Both side pockets have zippers and both have failed. The first was around 3 months and the 2nd around 6 months. The pockets are rather shallow so the zippers were important to ensure I didn’t drop anything. Without the zippers, things fall out while I’m seated.Would not recommend."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Casual cool,5,My husband loves it. Not too casual but not too dressy
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great jacket!,5,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He is a hard person to fit. Short arms but broad shoulders. I think the large is a little big but a medium would be too small. Still, despite it maybe being large, he looks great in it!! Great material and quality construction!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Other than that the jacket is a great value. Nice soft inside,4,The wrist straps are worthless and do not grab hold long. Other than that the jacket is a great value. Nice soft inside. Jacket does not feel thin and has a soft fleece inside that felt like it would keep me warm down to 32 degrees or so.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,ONE STAR! Is what I would give those other brands,5,This Jacket is every bit as good as a Northface or Colombia. The other brands charge you for the name but the Amazon essentials jacket puts them to shame. For the price there isn't a bad thing I can say about this jacket. Truly worth every penny and more
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Good value with a few small issues,3,"Fits about right. Not incredibly warm but repels wind and rain pretty well. Side pockets are placed a little high for my arms, I'm 6'1. I wear it to work every day and I've had it for about 3 weeks now. The cuff straps(male velcro side) should be a little longer. The female side is already wearing out and not keeping the strap down."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"This jacket fits as expected, looks great and was delivered quickly.",5,Excellent jacket! I highly recommend this one!
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,The jacket looks good with a pair of jeans or khakis,5,Sharp looking jacket. It's more of a 40's and 50's weather type coat. You'll have to layer for anything colder. Doesn't let water in. It fits true to size.The jacket looks good with a pair of jeans or khakis.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Really disappointed with this jacket,1,"Really disappointed with this jacket. At first it seemed great, with a nice thick materiel. However in daylight the jacket has a green tone to it. Also, both of the pocket zippers broke within the first two weeks. I definitely expected more from this product and would not recommend."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Just doesnt fit well,2,"The fit just isnt right. I am about 5'8"" 180lbs medium build and decided on a Large believing a Medium would be too small. The chest and waist  diameter/size is too large for me, and the sleeves are awkwardly proportioned. The length of the sleeve material on bottom (armpit to bottom of wrist) is short, and length of material on top (top of shoulder to top of wrist) is long, so it looks baggy when resting and is too short when stretching or reaching out for something. I feel as though I'm wearing Marty McFly's future jacket, but not in a good way."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,nice for the money,5,Color is a nice shade of blue and fits perfect for the size large which I normally wear.  It is a nice in-between jacket for fall and early winter.  Can't  beat the price for this jacket.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,My son likes it,4,Bought for my 23yr old as a gift. He wore it all the time. Great fit and looks nice.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Fits as expected, decent quality and price",4,"looks similar to my Weatherproof jacket. I'm 5'10, 200lbs and the XL is a bit loose. These are light jackets."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Nice product,5,Nice quality. Looks good.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Just what I needed.,5,Best jacket for a man of the tropics venturing into the European fall. It was just enough warmth for the chilly days and those with a bit of drizzle. Nor overly big when it was time to pack it away.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,My husband really liked this jacket when he first got it but since ...,2,My husband really liked this jacket when he first got it but since then the side pocket zipper has fallen off. He still wears it but is disappointed it fell apart some already.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great Value,5,This is a nice Spring / Fall coat. Seems well made and fits well.For 30 dollars it's a no brainer.I'm 6ft Tall/165 lbs/LeanA Medium is perfect.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Awkward Fit,3,"My husband is 6 foot 5 with a little gut so I purchased 2XL. The arms were too wide and bulky and the torso length was too short. This jacket seemed nice & my husband really wanted to like it, however the sizing was just too awkward so we had to return it."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Good material, crappy zipper.",3,"Jacket material feels high quality but it's a bit thick and rigid. A little bulky. The zipper also fell off one of the pockets, but it keeps me warm and I still use it. I guess I can't ask for more for a $30 jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,My style,5,It is my style and It is better if the upper pocket zipper is close to the main zipper
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Basic jacket,3,"This jacket waws just a little to basic, but if that's what you are looking for, then it may fit the bill. Obviously, it is not a North Face, but I would also say that the Costco version of this jacket is a little bit nicer."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Quality is fine, runs WAY large",3,"While I'm happy with the overall quality of this jacket, especially for the price, it runs HUGE. I'm 6'1, 175 lbs and normally wear a medium in jackets. I bought a small expecting it to run a bit big, and even that size fits really loose on me. If I were to buy again, I'd get an extra small which is crazy for someone my size."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Best when worn in very cold weather,4,It is very warm not something I would wear around low 50 °F it would have to be much colder than that or it would get too warm.Zipper seems to be fine but I was careful with it since it was mentioned that it breaks easily.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Very nice casual coat.,5,"Only thing I wish it had and expected was an INSIDE POCKET.  After I received it and realized it had no inside pocket, I revisited the description and there was no mention of an inside pocket... My mistake. I decided to keep it anyways as I really like the coat."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Highly recommend,5,"This tends to be the jacket I grab more often than not. This is light enough to wear in spring and fall but warm enough to also wear in the middle of winter. Pockets are great, outter matieral keeps you dry from the elements, and great price. Highly recommend."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Too large for its size,1,I ordered size S based on the measurement table.The jacket is way to big for its size.On the shoulders and neck it fits good. The arms are slightly short and the chest is very wide and too loose.I will try giving it away or return it.The jacket is thicker than I've imagined it.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,This jacket looks great on me and keeps me warm for the cold ...,5,"This jacket looks great on me and keeps me warm for the cold weather.

Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Not the best, but I'd still recommend it.",4,I like this jacket. It fits very well and seems to be high quality. Amazon needs to sow the Velcro on the arms better and replace the straps to fix them from falling off the Velcro constantly.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,just don't like the texture of the jacket,3,"It is obvious that the quality isn't up to par with Columbia or The North Face, but that was expected.I, personally, just don't like the texture of the jacket. It isn't very flexible even after multiple washes and makes a rough sound when I move my arms."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Not Accurate to size,4,I got a small one and it looked like of it was a large. I returned. Not slim fit or accurate to size. Very baggy.
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,A good soft shell,5,"Very comfortable and good looking, keep you warm but you need to add under clothing for good warmth"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,It works for tall women as well!,5,"This has the look and feel of a much more expensive jacket and fits true to size.  I am a taller woman, so finding sleeves that are long enough for me is always a challenge and I am usually left shopping in the men's department.  This jacket is basic enough that it will work well for a woman, but it is a little more fitted in the hips so keep that in mind ladies.Otherwise, I love it and cannot wait for the weather to turn a little colder so I can start wearing it around town."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Looks great, comfortable and good value.",5,"Fits well, sleeves good length.  Room enough for sweater underneath."

Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,The jacket is pretty comfortable and very warm,4,The jacket is pretty comfortable and very warm. It stands up to the higher-priced items like North Face jackets. Only few issues I've had with it was the zipper on one of the pockets came loose (simple fix with sewing kit) and the Velcro on the sleeves is slightly at an inconvenient location so you can have the sleeve either too tight or don't use the velcro at all at the risk of having a piece flapping off it. Overall pretty good product and I'm glad I got it.

Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Great Non-Leather Coat (SEE UPDATE - NOT SO GOOD),1,"...........................................................UPDATE (12/7/2019):I previously wrote a glowing review of this jacket, because I meant it.  This is the second one that I purchased.  The first one wore perfectly, but I just wore it out (the quasi leather) and so had to buy a new one.  I bought the current new one in March 2019, near the end of winter, and so I did not wear it, and merely put it aside until the middle of November, when the weather became cold again.  I still love the jacket, but the zipper does not function.  What I mean is that after I zip it up, it simply pulls apart, with only the very top part holding.My guess is that with all good things, someone in the executive office decided to start making them cheaper.  I don't want to accuse anyone, but that is the only thing I can determine.Since I only wore the jacket for a few weeks, I was hoping that Amazon would allow an exchange on the jacket, or, at least a discount on a new one, but that is not the case.  So, I got to wear my new jack for four weeks.  Thank you, Amazon.  You might want to know your long-term customers (as in over two decades) a little bit better.I am really sorry to no longer be able to use this jacket, as it is (was) a favorite of mine...otherwise, I would not have bought a second one.  But, considering the above, I do not see how I can buy another one.  And, to protect my fellow Amazon purchasers, I felt the need to update my experience with this jack.  Such a shame.  It truly is a great jacket, but I actually need to be able to keep it zipped up in the winter, and to have a tailor install a new zipper makes no financial sense to me.I can no longer endorse this product.(END UPDATE - 12/07/2019)........................................................................................I really like this coat.  But, with that said, I want to write a review that is as truthful as I can make it.  I am on my second coat (just purchased it a week from this posting).  I like it that much.The first coat, purchased from JC Penney in September of 2016 is starting to, for lack of better words, fall apart.  Don't get me wrong...I have really used this coat a lot, but I want to simply mention that after about 2 1/2 years some of the ""quasi"" leather has started to fall off, showing the brown cloth underneath.  I doesn't show all that much, which is why I hadn't noticed it until recently.  This has happened in two specific areas:  around the collar and on the upper right-hand chest, where my car's seat belt straps across the front of me.  I would have liked to have gotten more than 2 1/2 years use out of my first coat, but I really like this coat and so have made another purchase.One of the big reasons for my getting this coat is that it has SEVEN pockets, with two being zippered and two being snapped.  I need a lot of pockets for reasons of which I will not bore you.I saw where one reviewer said that his did not keep him warm.  I don't understand that, as that has not been my experience.  The sherpa (quasi wool) lining keeps me very warm.  If the temperature gets into the teens, then I might put on a sweater underneath the coat, as I really do not like being cold, especially when I go on long walks.A bit about me:  I am 5' 6 1/2"" tall.  I am actually in the process of losing weight, to cut back on my sugar level.  But, for now, here are my measurements:  neck=15.5"", chest=36 3/4"", waist=39"", and hips=36"".  OK, clearly I need to reduce my waist, but give me some credit...I have lost 20 pounds so far.  :)  My first coat was a large.  I could still wear the large and feel comfortable.  This new coat is a medium, and I tested it wearing my sweater, too, and it is fine.  Obviously, the medium is not as lose fitting as the large, but it is still comfortable.NOTE:  Even though I am relatively short, I have somewhat long arms...about 28"" from the tips of my fingers to my shoulder.  If you have short arms, this MIGHT be an issue for you.  With that said, the coat has the kind of cuffs that ""bind"" around your wrist (not overly tightly...so not uncomfortable), so it might not be all that bad, as the ""binding"" of the cuffs helps to keep the cuffs from falling into the hands.I wish my first coat did not fall apart on me, but I feel the coat, if bought for under $100, is a good substitute for the real leather coats that can cost several hundred dollars.  So, until I can save up for a leather coat, I am very happy with this coat in terms of price, appearance, and warmth (...and the pockets!)."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Great quality and desing,5,"I love this Jacket,it’s just perfect and great quality"
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Levis needs to make a 2XB,3,"First off, I bought this jacket because levis 2X is too small. It's not even close. So I went for the 3X. Talk about a quantum leap! Apparently the 2X is a 'regular' size, and the 3X is a 'big' size. While the chest is ok, the waist elastic barely touches my body and the elastic cuffs could fit my legs. On the other hand, the length is ok the materials and construction are first class. The faux leather on this jacket almost has thr feel and texture of  lambskin. Since I know the 2X won't work at all (at least till I lose a considerable amount of weight) I'll make do with the 3X for now. I just wish they'd make their 2X a 2XBig size rather than regular."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Not your grandpa’s flight jacket!,5,"My son just recently got his pilot license and I wanted to buy him a flight jacket. He is only 35, he is also tall and fit and has an athletic build. He also dresses nice and stylish.  All options found elsewhere were not youthful or stylish. They are made for your grandpa and his beer belly.NOT THIS JACKET! Functional, warm with a Sherpa lining, and fits his tall and fit frame. Faux leather is very well made and was even nicer than I hoped!Best part is that my son loves it!"
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,"Fits perfect, more Matte in person.",3,"Fits perfect with my body type. 5’ 9 @ 200 lbs. It’s not as shiny as it looks in the picture, it’s matte so in the dark it would look black instead of Navy Blue. Feels very warm so I can’t wait to use in the winter. Sherpa is on the collar and the inside body of the jacket, not in the sleeves."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Looks like a giant faux leather handbag,3,"Really wanted to like this jacket, been eyeing a new faux leather jacket with some edge for a while now. Pulled the trigger on this guy. Upon arrival I immediately noticed the high quality and thick faux leather which is rare, slipped it on to see that it had the dimensions of a giant burlap sack. Was way too baggy, I'm 5'8 ~150lbs and wear a medium in Levi's denim trucker jacket and I sized down in this jacket to a small hoping for a slimmer fit. There is nothing flattering about this jacket, very loose and boxy all over in the wrong ways and even the epaulets on the shoulders look tacky. Maybe sizing down even further to an XS would be worth it but I'm not impressed with the overall style. The hunt continues."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Seriously Legit!,5,"This Jacket is LEGIT! This is built like a high quality leather jacket without the genuine leather price tag. The construction is superb, smooth zippers, the faux leather feels soft and smooth and not in anyway cheap.Seriously a great faux leather jacket. I'm super impressed!"
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Great Look and Feel,5,"This jacket looks and feels so great. The Sherpa lining peeking out from the collar is a great look, not to mention how warm it keeps you.The jacket does not come with any string odors, even though it is not real leather. This makes me think that it’s a high quality item overall.The fit is a bit loose, but not roomy. You can easily have a layer underneath as long as it is not too thick. However the jacket will feel slightly tight at that point. It feels a bit loose around the stomach area.I also liked the colors available and leather/suede option.Great item at a great price."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Looks like it has shoulder pads,3,"Good quality jacket, but the fit is awful. It fits like it has shoulder pads or something. It throws off my proportions and just looks weird. Makes my shoulders look way too big for my body. I usually buy men’s jackets and this is the first time I’ve had this problem. I think the useless shoulder strap-things are the culprit. But unfortunately there’s no way to remove them without taking the seams apart.I also hate the faux hoodie zipper on the collar. There’s no point. It’s literally just a useless zipper for looks."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Extremely happy with this jacket.,5,"This may be faux leather, but who cares.  I'ts half the price of genuine leather and looks just as good.  It's warm and looks great.  All the pockets you could want.  It's a very stylish jacket.I'm 6', 210 pounds and slender build.  XL fits perfect for me.Before I bought this jacket, I made the mistake of buying a different Large size jacket, since I am slender, but it was too tight.  I thought the process of returning it would be a pain in the butt.  If you have a Kohl's store near you, they have a station dedicated for Amazon returns.  They will ship it back for you and it is the easiest thing in the world."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,In between size dilemma,4,"Do I love this jacket? Yes. Do I love the way it fits? No. I'm a true smedium (in between medium and small} so I ordered a small first because I believe this brand runs big. But the small was a little too snug and the length was a little shorter than I liked. I returned it and bought a medium and it's too big on me. It's very warm and I love how it feels, just not the sizing. The measurements for this size are accurate to my body but I do feel the medium is a little bigger than it should be"
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Nice Bomber jacket,5,Very nice jacket at a great price. So far there’s nothing I don’t like about it.
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Best jacket I’ve worn in awhile.,5,"I don’t write reviews often, but I bought this jacket used because I’m hesitant on buying things like this online.I received it and it is the most comfortable jacket I’ve had in awhile. It’s definitely high quality for a great price. I would pay full price for this jacket easily."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Bought for a Halloween Costume but enjoy it on its own,5,"I actually bought this coat to go with an Indiana Jones Halloween costume, they were low in stock at the time, so I got it a size slightly too large.  That said, the coat has generously sized pockets, which are far more accommodating for holding larger objects such as Sankara Stones, which many other coats I've owned would be unable to fit in their pockets, forcing me to stow such objects in my satchel.  The coat  is overall comfortable and I have enjoyed wearing it around without the rest of the costume it was originally purchased for."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,"Sharp looking, a little (not crazy) shiny",5,"First off it looks great. A little shiny but not too shiny. The sherpa in the collar area is a very sharp looking touch.I read the comments about sleeves being too long. Well, they are not too short but are not reaching out to your knuckles long..I ordered and kept an ""L"". I am 6'2', 200 pounds and I would not have been happy with an M or XL."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Size size size,3,I got a standard medium for my husband. he is 5.8 and has a decent athletic body. It just didn't sit right on him. I think the sleeves are a bit too baggy. I was looking at the other pictures and figured it would look okay but meh. the elastic bottom started to give way after the first use. I just wonder if this is normal.
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,This is one very classy looking jacket,5,"I got this for my dad whose old bomber jacket with his favorite VFW, etc patches had lost its 'leather’ coating. I sewed on the patches from his old one and it looks great and not 'too new’, if that makes any sense. It has that lived-in look like most Levi Strauss wear."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Nice jacket. I’d say high quality and comfort.,5,"Got it for my brother as a gift. He’s really tall and skinny, at about 6’1” and 160ish lb. So I got the large. It fit fairly well. Just slightly loose on the chest and a bit long on the arms. Still a better fit then if I got a smaller size I’m sure."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Fits as expected.,5,"I bought this for my husband and he looks like such a stud. He’s a dad now with a dad bod and he’s always torn between the style he had as a teenager and a more adult, refined style. He loves this and it looks so good on him. He has some big, broad shoulders and big upper arms and this still fit perfectly."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Awesome jacket,5,"Love Levis. Love their outerwear. Love this leather aviator bomber with fleece. Very much worth the price, which is a value imo."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,A winter winner here,5,"I bought this in a size small for my tall, rather broad shouldered 11 year old son. He’s at that age where he is too big for kid/teen size 16 clothes, but not quite fitting into most men’s clothing either. This jacket was perfect for him. Its been great for Georgia winter weather too (think cold and wet, but not snowy). Nice and warm. My son specifically wanted a brown leather bomber jacket, and when he got this for Christmas he was thrilled. He loves the look of it and wears it every day."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,I love this Coat!,5,It has become my new cold weather coat for running errands in the cold. Drive to work? Great for the walk from to car to the door. Don't be confused it is warm. You will be opening it up as soon as you get in the building. It is a very handy and stylish coat.
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Finally,5,"Finally (after wasted time & money) did I find the perfect ""leather"" jacket at an affordable price! Fit, weight & quality was all spot on."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Great for tall people,4,Im a tall woman who doesn’t tend to wear women’s jackets because they aren’t long enough. This was perfect. I got a large and it fits right under the belt line. Very comfortable and soft lining.
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Great Jacket,5,Bought this for my 19 yr. old son and he absolutely loves it.  It looks great on him.  Purchased a small as he is 5’4 and 126 lbs.  He has worn it every day here in PA since Christmas and it is wearing well.  He runs hot so it is all the jacket he needs.  If it is especially cold a hoodie and gloves and hat keeps him cozy.
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Good bargain,4,Looks great. Not real leather of course but it fit well and looks nice. Not likely the toughest material at the price it exceeds expectations. I usually wear tall sizes and the large fits me perfectly so it might be long for shorter guys. Pleased with my purchase after several weeks of use!
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Pleased with purchase,5,This jacket fit as expected and the earth color was actually darker than that pictured. There are plenty of pockets and the lining seems to be adequate for warmth during these upper midwest winters. I'm pleased with the purchase.
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,It's a damn nice jacket!,5,It's nice.It's stylish.It's very warm.It's got lots of pockets - and the outside zippered ones are deep enough for my iPhone or a pair of glasses.Buy one - you won't be disappointed!
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Fake leather looks fake.,3,"Not crazy impressed with how the material feels on the outside. feels and looks fake.The inside fuzzy stuff is just on the torso, sleeve material is cold.The elastic around the wrists is not tight and bags a little.Otherwise, jacket is great."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Poor fit,2,"I really wanted to like this jacket.  Ordered my normal XL size, but found that the sleeves were too short and the collar was a lot taller that it looked in the photo. Nice material and lining but didn't look good on, so I returned."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Great value & warm jacket,5,"Similar to real leather at fraction of the price!  Good workmanship all around the jacket.  Moderately warm jacket for dry or damp weather.  I really like the appearance of this design, could be better with air force wings on chest or across the back perhaps."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Great Quality very warm,4,"I bought this jacket as a replacement for my old fake leather jacket that was designed for winter. It's definitely very warm and comfortable. It's my first bomber jacket (style) as my old jackets were all motorcycle jackets, so I really miss the zip cuffs. But other than that my only wish is that the collar would turn out instead of in (like in the picture). The turned in collar bumps my chin. If anyone has any advise on how to get the collar to stay out I'd love to hear it."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Great Jacket !!!!,5,I ordered the XTRA LARGE and was worried it might be too big. It fit great....not too big.....not too small.Love it !!!!

Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,The sleeves are long enough,5,"He has a very difficult time finding clothes that the sleeves go all the way down, and this jacket is wonderful, the sleeves go all the way down and the jacket fits him very nicely. The jacket looks very nice, and it is very comfortable for him."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Great Jacket!,5,"My husband is 6'3"", 238 pounds and has very broad shoulders. The 2XLT fits him perfectly. It is a great looking and feeling jacket. I can't speak to it's durability but I am hoping it lasts awhile. Love that it is Levi's. Don't like it is made in China."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Everything is perfect but the sleeve length! Almost 3 inches too long WTF,1,"The jacket is of high quality, and fits perfect around the shoulders. However, the arm length is nearly 3 inches too long! Even folding the cuff inwards, it's still too long. XS jacket, I'm a 5'7 male, I don't know what they're thinking."

Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Itchy neck but otherwise good,4,"It's apparent it's a faux leather jacket but it fits well. 6' / 200lb = XL  My only complaint is the Sherpa interior at the collar is very scratchy but the jacket is very warm. (Imagine that, buying a jacket for warmth, ha!)"
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,"Sick jacket, but too big 2XL-Reg",4,"I am a 22 year old  6' 0"" 190 African-American male ,athletic build, classic mesomorph body type. The jacket wrist was significantly too large, the arms were very rooms and the torso was also a bit roomy. I like my jackets a bit snug ( not too much though).

Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Runs large but really nice soft PU leather,5,"Found this in the jcp clearance rack in a medium which is my usual size.  The medium was a little long in the body so i checked online and got a small.  The fit is still on the slightly larger size even in a small.  I am a long and broad shouldered body, short legged 5'7"" 160lbs.  Im keeping the size small.  I have had other brands of PU leather jackets in the past and this is by far superior in look and feel.  No stiffness or squeakiness.  Soft and flexible even in winter temps.  Not as shiny as the online pictures.  Still a little more glossy thab my girlfriends lambskin jacket.  It may wear to be more matte.  Some of the stitching is a little bad where they over stitched or ran out of thread so you can see some small needle holes next to the stitch, but im not that picky to return it.  Overall very pleased and a good looking jacket."
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Great jacket with crap pockets,3,I love this style of jacket. I have on major issue with it though. Was ordered as a gift for me and love the look and fit but the pockets are made of very poor quality thin nylon that have torn in all but one pocket so everything falls into the liner.  That cost it 2 stars
Levi's Men's Faux Leather Sherpa Aviator Bomber Jacket,Husband loves this jacket.,5,He owned a previous version of this coat for two years and that one held up well. He really needed a Tall version and that wasn't available when he bought his first one. This XLTall fits great and stays pulled down below the belt.
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,Save your money,1,"This would be perfect for those bitter cold winters in Cancun, Hawaii, or Arizona.  It might even be great for a ski trip, while you're on the bus or airplane on the way to the peaks, before changing into something that's a little more suitable for going outside into the real world.  This thing is a lined windbreaker, nothing more.  As I type this, it's currently negative 40F wind chill, and I have to spend time outside in this weather.  This ""winter jacket"" is nowhere near up to the task - I'd be better off wearing a $20 hoodie.  It's getting returned.  Columbia *used* to make good winter jackets...  Apparently they still believe global warming is real."
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,Dry and warm.,5,"I hot it in red, a nice darker shade, comfortable. Worn it in the rain and it kept me dry and warm on cold days.Only negative, on windy days the hood keeps blowing off my head, I miss the drawstrings that used to make it easier to adjust."
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,IS NOT A WINTER COAT,5,"Excellent coat for the fall. The fit is perfect and it also has so much room in the pockets. Not very good for the winter in the Midwest, the insulation is not enough, and IS NOT OMNI-HEAT."
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,Very poorly made....cheap.,1,"Very cheaply made. The exterior was as thin as a pair of wind pants, the interior was very thin as well. The elastic bands were very thin as well. Not good."
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,Fits slightly larger than I like. Probably will be ok for the average customer.,5,"Seems to be a good all around jacket.  I’m not  very tall (5’6”) but go to the gym a lot so my chest and arms are bigger than the average person my size.  That said,  I originally ordered a medium but the arms were too long for me. I don’t like them half way down my hands so I exchange it for a small that is just barely in my chest and biceps range but I’m happy with it. I just can’t put a sweatshirt under it."
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,Runs big,4,Bought this for my husband who could care less about what his jackets look like but he was excited about this one. He normally wears a 2xl in shirts but as other reviews have said this jacket runs big. Probably could have gone with the XL but he didn't to wait for me to exchange it. He really like the zip out fleece option so that's a win. Overall nice coat just order a size down.
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,Nice looking jacket ..Not warm enough,4,The liner seems to be much smaller than the jacket.  Not as warm as other Columbia's I've had .  jacket without liner is fairly comfortable and somewhat true to size as expected Columbia tends to run a little small .  If your looking for a super warm jacket this problably isn't the one

Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,Nice one Columbia!,5,Wonderful for wind breaking and able to attach to my fleecy Columbia jacket inside it!
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,Perfect,5,"Perfect fit for a LG. It not super wide but longer as needed.

Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,"Perfect fit, super comfortable!",5,"Being someone who lives in an area where it snows, and who also travels to the Midwest quite often in the winter; I am no stranger to the “tri-climate” type of jacket. I have owned jackets from Columbia, North Face, and both are always premium choices when it comes to practical all weather jackets. Normally when it comes to these types of coats, I would go for the fuzzy lined or puffer lined; but I haven’t owned one a coat that has a fleece on the inside. I ordered this for my husband, he’s 6’4, 190 lbs and as you can tell from the picture it fits him perfectly!I would say that this specific model of a jacket would be best suited for someone that lives in an area that sees snow, but doesn’t reach temperatures below 10 degrees on a normal basis. Living in Virginia, this would be the perfect coat because it has the soft fleece to keep you warm in moderately cold weather, then the lightweight rainproof exterior that also doubles as a wind breaker. The fleece coat on the inside is super soft, with a brushed fleece feel. When combined with the waterproof windbreaker on the outside it provides extraordinary warmth for winter weather. Now I wouldn’t say that this is AS warm as maybe a 500 puffer jacket, but for everyday winter weather it does the job!For anyone choosing to purchase a coat, you always have to find one that suits your needs, and the weather that you will be exposed to. For me, this jacket suits my needs perfectly! The only downside I would say is that the outside of the windbreaker does get a little noisy, but most of my jackets made out of a similar material make the same sound. Overall for the price I believe that this is a quality, high performance jacket that will last years to come. The jackets fit inside each-other perfectly, and it only takes minutes to switch them on/off if you want to make some quick changes. I also appreciated the pockets and smooth zippers! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a long lasting warm and practical jacket!"
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,A quality product with many configurations for multiple activities and weather,5,"I’m a fan of Columbia clothing and this jacket did not disappoint. I have had a similar jacket from another company that I’ve worn for many years, but this one has several features that are much better. The hood, for starters, can be easily removed or it can be rolled up and placed hidden under the collar. I usually wear a hat so this is a great feature. Also, there is a slight brim to the hood like my raincoat has. This keeps the hood from covering my eyes and yet still keeps the rain/snow off my face. Speaking of rain/snow, the outer shell of the jacket is waterproof not just water resistant. Those of you who have been to the Oregon coast understand the need for waterproof versus water resistant. I do a lot of outdoor winter activities and this jacket is perfect for them because layers is what is needed. Because i often work up a sweat when snowshoeing or cross country skiing, it’s important for me to be able to remove the inner coat or just wear the inner coat. Quite often I will wear only the outer shell and a simple base layer underneath. This jacket allows many options depending on the activity or the weather. I also like that the hood, bottom of the coat and the ends of the sleeves all tighten to stop the cold air from flowing into any of the associated areas. Finally, I like all the inner and outer pockets, the ease at which the coats come apart and the quality of the zippers, velcro and seams. This is a high quality product with many configurations for multiple activities and weather."
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,Interchangeable with themselves and previous Columbia models.,5,"What I really love about this is that it is perfectly compatible and interchangeable with my two-piece Triple I/C Columbia jacket I bought 3-8 years ago!  In fact, I completely love that jacket (actually, those jackets) as well, because I won't replace them completely, but I'll be thrilled to have even more versatility.  Note that this is Medium and fits the same as my previous medium, interchange zippers are both on the same sides and have the exact same number of teeth as did my previous model.The outer layer on my previous model was a little heavier than this one and had some features that made it more like something you'd snow in.  You could do the same here, but this is a little bit more all-purpose.  This still has two side-zip pockets and an inner-zip pocket, but now this has two upright front button pockets rather than one chest zip pocket.  My last one was waterproof (up until a point - heavy enduring rain being that point) for a long time, but as sort of lost that ability.  This one is clearly the same material and should do me well.  It's also very black - I can see now how much the old one has faded over the years.I really liked that my older jacket had a jacket for the inner instead of a fleece because I don't love fleece jackets.  That said, this one is actually quite nice - no stray fibers, not stretched out or anything like that.  Dark grey and it looks really good.  I guess it will also be quite warm.  This has two inner mesh pockets.  Still not as nice as my other's inner jacket when it was new, but those non-fleece inner models are few and far between.Overall, a great pair of jackets, just as I expected."
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,Versatile four season jacket,5,"The fit is true to size but if you’re unsure I’d size up, especially if you’re going to be wearing sweaters under it.  For reference the photos are 5’10 and 170lbs with a heavy sweater underneath it.With the fleece on it’s really warm if you take it out you have a great rain jacket. This will mostly be worn for dog walking and the occasional hike in cold but not arctic conditions.  There’s lots of room to move, nice ventilation and pockets galore.Overall a very versatile jacket at a price that won’t break the bank."
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,Usual Columbia Quality,5,"This is a very good ""soft"" rain shell with fleece liner. I generally have problems with this kind of outerwear on warmer days when it feels like I’m wearing a plastic bag, making me quickly get hot and sweaty. That is not a problem here. The outer jacket is made of a material that is breathable but water resistant. I've worn it when the temperature was 65°F with light rain with a short-sleeve shirt underneath and no liner and stayed dry but was not unduly warm or sweaty at all. But I have also worn it on a much colder, rainy day when the ""Feels Like"" temperature was 40°F with the fleece liner zipped in. I was comfortably warm with the hood over my head but my jeans below the hem of the coat were soaked through. My head and torso, however, were totally dry.The hood is an essential feature for a rain shell and this jacket has a good one, offering a draw cord I can tighten around my face that has a very high chin-covering neckline and grippers to keep the hood adjusted semi-permanently. The hood also has a velcro strip on top so you can adjust how much it comes down over your face.  The cuffs at the wrist have velcro closures that can be adjusted to whatever tightness you prefer.The front zipper looks to be of good weight and quality, has a storm flap, and zips down to the bottom of the hem and up to the top of the collar. There are also velcro patches next to the zipper so you can close the front that way rather than zipping it. The two exterior slash pockets have zipper closures and the two chest pockets have velcro closures. There are two interior pockets without closure in the fleece liner but none in the shell. The waist has stretchy material to keep out the cold as well as draw cords with grippers on both the shell and the liner.I am 5’9” and 158 pounds. I took the Medium and the jacket fits perfectly. Shoulders and sleeves are good. The hem of the jacket comes down 8 or 9 inches below my belt for good wet-weather coverage. I have other Columbia coats and jackets in Medium and they fit perfectly as well. Columbia sizes its garments honestly so there's no need to adjust your real size up or down.The outer shell is 100% nylon. The fleece liner is 100% polyester. It is made in Vietnam."
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,"Very comfortable, versatile jacket",5,"This is a great jacket. It's very comfortable with deep, functional pockets that are well-placed and secure. It stays dry in the rain but also keeps you warm. My husband is a veterinarian who spends a lot of time outside with large animals and it keeps him warm and dry. A bonus is the fleece lining,  which is lightweight but still warm, and can be removed and worn on its own (an important feature here in the mid-Atlantic where the weather changes frequently); the lining is just enough to cut the chill without being too warm.The outer shell does a good job keeping out cold wind. Zippers are smooth and well-sewn. The jacket fits true to size; my husband is a L/XL in shirts and coats, and this fits but without room for layering much underneath (he tends to wear light garments under). If you want to wear a sweater or sweatshirt under it, and you're his size or borderline, I suggest ordering up for comfort.We've had several Columbia jackets over the years and they always shine in the areas of quality and durability. I expect no different from this one, but I'll update if any issues arise."
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,Two for one special with this jacket,5,"This jacket is pretty much two in one.  You can take the fleece lining out and use it as a fleece jacket, use the outer layer as a rain coat/light windbreaker or keep them combined for a warm the majority of cold/rain weather.  Even the hood can be removed, rolled up and stored on the coat.This jacket can be utilized for pretty much all ‘crummy’ weather conditions.  This is very true to size for a jacket, which in my personal experience is slightly larger then your regular size.  Basically, if you wear a M buy a M it will be slightly big to allow you to layer.  Really good bargain of a deal for what you get."
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,Economical Entry into Interchange Jackets,4,"Columbia men's Timberline Triple I/C Interchange Winter Jacket includes an inner fleece and an outer shell.  You can wear either separately, or both together.  The jacket's exterior shell is nylon and feels light and cheap.  The fleece is of moderate quality, at best, IMHO.  It's not as thick or soft, or finished as my other fleece.  The fleece has loops by the wrists that you use to attach it to the shell with the snaps included in the shell.  The jacket is moderately warm, and is good for temperatures of as low as the 40s IMHO, unless you're exercising.  Overall, at the tag price of  around $150, it's a fair value.  I'd rather pay $50 more for a higher quality jacket."
Columbia Men’s Timberline Triple Interchange Winter Jacket,Three in one to meet many winter needs,4,"Versatile and good for a variety of weather needs, this is a fleece jacket and a waterproof shell that can each be worn alone or paired for a fairly warm winter jacket. It looks good and wears well. I do think it runs just a bit small so size up if you are in doubt. Great for traveling to and from different weather zones. The lightweight shell works as a waterproof windbreaker, the fleece gives a warm jacket and together they are great for winter weather.  If it’s frigid I’d say you need more but for moderate winter weather this is a great combo."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Great jacket,5,"Only writing this review because I was so frustrated with the other reviews when I bought this jacket. Everyone else was eager to say what size they bought, but not what weight or height they are, thus not actually being helpful . My husband is 6’0 and 210 lbs and a large fits perfectly. The jacket has a fairly thick lining and holds up well to wind, rain, and cold. That’s how you write a review people."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Good dry and warm jacket,5,"The jacket is nice, keepa you dry and warm. Its got a liner compared to a windbreaker.  There is two outside zippered pockets. Inside there is a chest height pocket. The bottom of the jacket has a chord that can be tighten to keep the wind from going up inside the jacket.  I am a big fan of a hood that can be tucked inside or removed, this one does not have that feature.  Otherwise, this a a very good rain jacket for the price."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Fine quality rain jacket,5,"Great jacket, bought to replace a similar Columbia jacket. This one may be even better - and I loved the old one - as it has a thin layer of fleece lining for added warmth. Fit was perfect. I bought a Large and I'm 5'10"" and weigh 198"
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Simple Rain/Wind Jacket,4,"I would have to say that there's nothing special about this jacket.  It performed well in a light rain, but given that the tag said, ""water resistant,"" I'd not trust it for all-day protection.  Although it's lined, it's not much for warmth.  I wore it today in 40° weather with two light long-sleeved layers and I was a bit chilly.  When the weather drops below 40°, I'd opt for something warmer or go with a heavy sweater layer under this.  It seems well-made and is light enough that it'd stuff easily in a pack or golf bag.  It's a four star item."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Good quality rain protection,4,I love this jacket and am glad I made the purchase.  I like the way the exterior fabric feels and also love how it is not really noisy like many other rain jackets I have bought in the past.  I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars for one reason.  The lining of the hood is cloth.  I have a head of hear that I style daily.  I wear this jacket to work as one would expect but when I do put the hood up I have to be careful when I remove the hood because it will easily mess my hair up.  I get that it will not affect everyone this way but for me it does.
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",It may be going back,2,"I bought this jacket for backpacking, where ounces count. One of the reasons that I purchased it is because the weight was listed at 14 ounces. As soon as I opened the package, I put the jacket on the scale to see what the actual weight is. I always expect an ounce or so difference, but this weighed in at 20 ounces, 6 more than it was listed at. Also, it seems fairly thin, like it won’t stand up to a hard rain.It did fit very well, came in at a decent price, and i love the lining, but I’m not happy about the weight difference. I’ll have to wear it in the rain to see how it holds up. If it holds up, I’ll have to find somewhere else to cut a bit of weight from my pack. This puts me over 17lbs base weight, and I don’t want to be there."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Liner is Scratchy Feeling,2,"I got it for cheap and it looks nice but overall I dont like it that much for two reasons:-the pocket liner is really uncomfortable and scratchy feeling , putting my hands in the pockets is like nails on a chalkboard - just gives you a bad feeling.-Dont like how the hood and collar go together. Would rather not have the collar there at all."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Runs big for size XL,4,"I wear size XL in all my shirts and jackets/coats, I tried this jacket on wearing a sweat shirt with sleeves cut short, over a T-shirt,  Jacket is way to big.My shirt sleeve length is 33 1/2,  Jacket sleeves went to my knuckles, My waist 35"". Waist was so big I could fold jacket front over 5"",  Lower part around hips was also too big.  Returned for size Large."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,","Exactly what I ordered, no hassles, no delays!",5,"I needed a new rain jacket/windbreaker. Fla weather doesn't usually require a heavy jacket and we do outdoor art shows in the fall and spring, so this is exactly the weight jacket I needed. Depending on the temperature I can go with either a short sleeve or a long sleeve t shirt and be as comfortable as needed that day! It's a Columbia brand rain jacket so the quality is obvious. Very pleased and like the two tone red and black color scheme too!"
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Jacket arrived with a scratch,1,the jacket with a cut in the fabric. unfortunately I cannot return it because I live outside the United States. they should be more careful with quality controls.ComentariosImageTraductor ·

"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Superb quality and style,5,"Columbia is an industry leader that never disappoints. I love this jacket so much. It does everything it advertises so well.The first day I wore it, my girlfriend fell in love with it and now she has one also. Ha!"

"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Does the job,5,Great rain coat that holds up. It doesn't feel cheap like it will rip if you catch an edge of something. The pockets are easily accessible so grabbing keys or anything you need quick access to during a down pour is simple and quick. It's hard to beat a 20 dollar Columbia coat even if the coloring isn't popular.

"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Added warmth,4,"Coat has clean lines, hook/loop wrist closures and the lining really makes the jacket much better to wear than a nylon coat without a lining.

"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Perfect Fit for Tall/Slim Guys,5,"My son is 6'3"" and 180lbs - I spend a lot of time looking for Large TALL sized clothes - he loves the jacket - wears while walking around campus on the cool winter days and fits perfectly."

"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Does it's job,5,Bought for grandson to wear for work. He wanted a little large to fit over his other clothes and  have room. He loves it.
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Great Jacket,5,Columbia quality as expected. Lining in jacket and hood are lightweight and leave room for layering underneath.
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Great jacket.,5,Great jacket for my climate and works for me in weather at 30°.  I would like another in different color.
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Great rain jacket,5,The outer fabric seems well made and isn’t flimsy or too stiff. Feels like a jacket that will last several seasons. Inside layer comfortable as well.
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Nice looking jacket,3,"Nice looking jacket, runs a little small but is not water proof only resistant, we returned it for another one that was water proof"
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Light weight windbreaker.,4,"It's a nice quality wind breaker. There's no lining so it's not much for warmth but if you want something really light weight, it's a good choice."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Great lightweight jacket,5,Perfect lightweight coat for temps in the high 40s to low 60s...can't speak to the rain resistance as we lucked out  with no rain over 10 days while traveling in London and Edinburgh.
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",I love it.,5,"1. It could be fire resistant.  I imagine it's not for environmental reasons.2. It could include something like Gore-tex, but then the price point would be higher."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Great jacket.,4,"Would’ve liked it to be a little longer, but I am 6’4”.  That said I still plan to wear it as a spring fall and rain jacket.  Very nice."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",excellent jacket,5,great jacket and excellent value!
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Must have Jacket when outdoor,5,I Liked everything about this jacket. Correct size and fit. I used it on my trip to Balkans and it was dry  despite the rain and kept me warm. Will order again when the item is on sale.
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Comfortable and Effective in Light Rains,5,I particularly like the light lining that helps keep the chill off for those rainy cool days.  It is the most comfortable rain jacket I've owned.
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Satisfied customer.,5,"Replaced an eight-yeaer-old Columbia rain jacket whose zipper gave up.  The fit of this one is even better, and I like the light fleece lining."

"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,","Great, light raincoat for cool to warm weather",4,"Light weight, comfortable, rain coat - the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 was because there is no inside coat pocket like my last coat."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",The hat,1,"Who ever designed a hat it's a piece of crap, use it for the first time today because it started raining.  If you pull the strings it just bunches up and you can't see."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",The Tall Size Doesn't Correspond With The Length,4,"If the jacket length was to mid thigh and a little less baggy at the bottom, which causes the need to use the draw strings, I would have rated a 5 rather than a 4. The 3xT was too short for me, as I'm 6'3"" tall. So I ordered a 4xT which turned out to be a bit too short and far too baggy, which requires pulling the draw strings. I'd expect the Big sizes to be baggy, but not the Tall sizes."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Good quality from Columbia.,5,Good quality. Insulated. Works well by itself or as a shell for layering. Water repellent.

"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",One Star,1,To small zipper on the left
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Columbia can do better than this,1,"Not waterproof.  The lining is simply brushed polyester, which does nothing to insulate body heat.  Jacket does not slide on and off over other layers because of the polyester.With all the technology that is in higher priced Columbia products, this garment does nothing for you when it is wet, windy, and cold."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Just what I was looking for!!,4,Very satisfied with the jacket
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Excellent,5,Perfect.  As expected.

"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Five Stars,5,The whole jacket
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",to get a good raincoat that is breathable but returning things online are ...,2,"I expected it to be breathable. As well as I expected this to be water proof, instead of highly water resistant. I would return it, to get a good raincoat that is breathable but returning things online are really hard and this is a needed item as my last raincoat is at least 15 years old. I hope I do not burn up and I did not expect a felt inside of the jack. I am highly disappointed as this was not clearly advertised. I would have gotten a different Raincoat. The only bright side to this is the fact that the color scheme is cool."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Four Stars,4,Ok
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Five Stars,5,Love it
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Five Stars,5,Typical Columbia quality!!
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Three Stars,3,A little big
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Great rain gear.,5,Exactly what I expected from Columbia. Will always buy. Item came on time as advertised.
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Well made rain coat,5,"I bought a size XL for my husband fits him perfectly. This is a nice, high quality, and well made rain coat with a good that can be zipped in to collar. It has plenty of zippered and roomy pockets. I would definitely purchase another one."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Size,2,Bought this jack to try on for a new job in case it rains. Bottom of jacket fit too tight and I wear a size 31 jeans so it was a tight fit. It get a lot looser at the chest and arm length for jack was way too long. I guess this was made for super slim tall guys. Will be returning.
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",hood is really small,2,"I ordered this in XLT, and the overall length, arms, and shoulder space was perfect, although the hood is super small.  honestly its seems like they took the hood from a child's jacket and stuck it on here.  also, as other reviewers have pointed out, only the torso is lined, not the arms."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,","Keeps you from getting soaked, but does not keep you dry.",2,"This jacket is a great jacket for layering under it or packing in a pinch. It does leak water very easily, though. Don't expect to be able to wear a backpack without water bleeding through. A fleece layer under the jacket keeps me dry, but that kind of defeats the purpose of a rain jacket. I wanted to use it for fly fishing Arkansas tailwaters on cloudy, cold streamer days, but if it's leaking after its second wear then it will stay at home."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",It does not have a stow-away hood as noted in the description.,3,"Not as described on website. Nice jacket otherwise. Can't go wrong with the Columbia brand. A stowaway hood was required by me, but the hood is attached to the back of the jacket with no possibility of folding or rolling it into the collar or anywhere else. It has to hang permanently from the back of the collar."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Wonderful Jacket - absolutely love it.,5,"Perfect for our upcoming trip to Ireland - light, lined (no condensation), right length, nice hood.  Would buy it a gain in a heartbeat.  Terrific price, also."
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Perfect,5,great product
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Brrr no more,5,Helping me survive this winter
"Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Lined Rain Jacket,",Great rain jacket even for a large person,5,I like this rain jacket as it covers me including the hood and  kept me dry these rainy days this summer.
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,DO NOT PURCHASE,1,"DO NOT BUY!!! Horrible quality, they didn't even send the same exact jacket in the picture- it has a different pattern in the bottom and it looks terrible. Looks nothing like the guy in the picture. I have the exact body as the male in the picture, and lord behold, the jacket isn't slim. Its baggy, as if it were sewn in the wrong place; so its unfix able- no matter how much you try to position it to look good, its not going to happen. I'm not a crazy broad-shouldered guy, and the shoulders on this jacket are nothing like in the picture. In the picture, the shoulders of the jacket are clearly wider than the base of the jacket itself, however the real jacket, the shoulders are parallel with the sides, as if my shoulders were flat with the sides of my stomach. I made a mistake of reading all the good reviews, not the bad ones. Always keep in mind, a company can write good reviews about themselves but they will never write a bad review about themselves, so always read the bad ones, as a company wont write a bad review about themselves; so you know your getting a REAL review. I'm warning you not to purchase this product, I will update my review after I get a hold of customer service. I will also purchase another jacket and ill give leads to a similar, but better quality jacket."
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,White (sand) was still darker like khaki,4,"Im 6'3"" 215 and wear an XL shirt.  I got the US XL and it fit well.  I just didn't like that the color was khaki.  When I opened the package I didn't recognize what I had ordered!  I thought it was some canvas bag initially.  Otherwise it seemed well made.  I was hoping for an off white winter jacket (live in FL)."
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,Decent jacket for $30,4,"The build quality is nice.  It's a thicker canvas like material on the outside, which is what I wanted. The fit is a little weird to me.  I'm 6'1"" and 160 lbs.  I also have semi-broad shoulders. I got a large and  a medium.  The large shoulders fit great and the sleeves were the right length but it was so baggy on my I sent it back.  The medium has a great slim fit in the chest/ab area but the arms are a little short and the shoulders are a little tight. I guess I would say that if you are 6' tall get a baggy large or get a medium and pull the sleeves up.As for the style, it looks exactly like the picture (though I bet the sleeves are to short and that's why they are pulled up in all the pictures). I'd definitely buy it again."
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,"Covered in lint, poor quality, shrinks in the wash, but good fit",1,"Where do I even begin? The jacket arrived on time and I was excited to open the package only to discover the the jacket was covered completely in lint. Its horribly made and looks very different from the image shown. Under further examination i discovered that the brand tag had been cut off the jacket from the inside collar area. On the other hand, the jacket did fit me perfectly (size small). But when I washed it to get the lint out, it shrank. I probably shouldve known it'd do that. But yeah over all a disappointing product."
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,so having some extra space would be great to add a layer for the fall and early ...,4,"Quite stylish, lots of pockets (check the pics) and is really a tan color instead of 'white'. I'm 5' 6"" and 135 lbs and picked a Medium size. The shoulders, upper back and sleeves fit perfectly but it's kinda baggy in the lower back. Granted, I had on a black button long sleeve, so having some extra space would be great to add a layer for the fall and early winter here in Chicago. The material seems strong enough to last a few years but thin though. Could fit easily my phone, wallet or sunglasses on any of the three pockets, two outside and one inside. Overall, I'm satisfied with the jacket but I definitely don't agree that is a 'slim fit', at least not in the torso."
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,Acceptable material and workmanship ... formaldehyde smell,3,"Yep, it's yet another import clothing piece that's good enough, except for the formaldehyde smell. I worry about putting this is my washing machine. The last time I did something like that, the smell permeated my machine and then got on the next load of laundry I did. Very bad!The jacket seems nice enough. I would really like to wear it. I'm just not sure I want to ruin my laundry to do so."
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,h,1,"For me this jacket fitted nothing like the picture and perhaps I should have paid closer attention to the fabric component. It  did not drape well on my sons body ( he has a very lean body), and it had this bulky look. He was still willing to wear the jacket until he realized that he had to wear the sleeves exactly how the model has it."
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,It Shrunk and get really wrinkle after one wash!,1,"I got a Medium and it fit quite good.  The shirt does look very stylish and likes it for the 1st day.  After I wash it, it gets really wrinkle and even shrunk down.  The fabric underneath already torn out.  The fabric is so cheaply made and not sewn together very well.  The Zipper is the most problem with this Jacket, it super weak and get really torn and wrinkle after one wash.  I have to Iron this Jacket every time now after every wash.  Also, the color also does not represent the picture.  It more of a darker khaki color than white teal.This is a stylish jacket and you will like it.  Just know that is will shrunk after you wash it, and get really wrinkle.  The fabric isn't great, and the sewing on this is terrible, it does come off quite easily.I'm thinking about Returning this since it not really worth it."
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,Two Stars,2,Cheap material and sewing is un even on the shoulder area☹️
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,Also the khaki color doesnt look as good as its shown in the picture,1,"Ordered M and received XXL . Very dissatisfied with the purchase. Also the khaki color doesnt look as good as its shown in the picture. So, dont expect too much with this jacket.."
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,its thick and kinda solid and the inner coat looks like a classy tie,4,"After reading other reviews I kind knew what to expect.  What I was surprised by as the quality, its thick and kinda solid and the inner coat looks like a classy tie.. But lets keep it plain here people, this is totally Chinese, but it actually looks like its worth more.  I'm 5' 11"" and 140-5 lbs with somewhat built shoulders. I ordered a medium.  This jacket fits near perfectly as a medium (after a wash/yes it does get smaller).  Usually I go with small because I like my clothes tight, atleast in the right places.  One size up and its a pretty good fit, no where near tailored but not bad.  Its very tight in the shoulders, and loose in the belly.  I might add some pictures later."
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,I ordered a white jacket. The package says white ...,1,I ordered a white jacket.  The package says white but the jacket is a medium beige color. It is also much larger than photo around the mid-section.  I would not call it a slim fit jacket.
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,Nice design but arms sleeves are too small.,4,I Really love these designs but they were tooooo tight on the arms.  They are made for very skinny arms people.  Other than that it seems to be a very good material and I hope they make a larger arms size I n the future.
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,Great casual jacket,5,The sizing chart is accurate.  It is with taking the time to measure yourself to get the right size.  It is casual jacket that goes well with v neck shirt.  The black catches lint easy.  I have to press and roll off the jacket after each use.  I recommend the chalk color.
XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,Bought it for the design only.,4,Bought it for the design only. The material is cheap as others have stated. I would pay more for better materials though. It also will shrink like crazy once you wash and dry it. I bought a larger size knowing that it will shrink thanks to others reviewers.

Having said that, if the shoulders were broader and everything else was the same, I would wear this jacket.  Unfortunately my shoulders are too broad for their cut/pattern."

XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,Really bad quality.,1,"I usually don't write reviews but had to make an exception with this horrible product.

XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,Not What Was Expected (not recommended),1,"The jacket that arrived for me did not look at all like the one in the pictures shown.

XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,Wrinkles like crazy,2,"Beware: the zipper is on the wrong side; if this doesn't bother you, then carry on. In addition, the jacket is cotton and wrinkles a lot. It was shipped folded into a shipping bag. No amount of ironing could remove the wrinkles. The creases and wrinkles were so bad that I had to take it to a dry cleaner and have it cleaned and pressed. This cost almost as much as the jacket. I would't recommend this item."

XueYin Men's Cotton Lightweight Slim Fit Jacket Casual Wear,Unsatisfied and disappointed I am returning this item,1,The wrong color jacket was sent.The fit seemed far more loose and baggy than expected.The zipper was on the wrong side. Typically women's clothing has zippers and buttons on the opposite side than that of men's clothing. I had to double check that it was in fact supposed to be a men's jacket. Apparently this jacket is just one which is poorly designed or crafted. Unsatisfied and disappointed I am returning this item.

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Awesome jacket. Great price too!,5,"Jacket is great! Nice and light, but totally warm. Love that you can pack it down into a little bag for storage and travel. I love the colors, height of the collar and the inside pockets & outside zip pockets. I’m 5’4 and about 140 so I ordered the men’s small. I could definitely wear a sweater under the jacket and still be comfy."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Just super,5,Thanks!!! Just Super
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Nice Tommy Hilfiger Jacket,5,"I'm 5'8 and 180 lbs and I ordered the large black jacket. It fits pretty good.. maybe slightly large which is fine by me.  The jacket is surprisingly warm though will certainly benefit from some layers in really cold weather. I wish the jacket was all black and did not have the coloring on the zipper - like the way the down version of this jacket is. This jacket is stuffed with polyester and I prefer it over down since there is no feather leakage with this. This jacket is packable.. you can compress it/fold it up and put it in a small bag it comes with.  I haven't tried that and probably won't use it like that...I just hang it on a hanger. Overall, I think this jacket offers good value for the money."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Light and comfortable,5,"This is a light weight jacket, and while not suitable for extreme weather conditions, it is fairly warm and water resistant.  The sleeves are non-binding and allow free movement.  The jacket can be crunched down to a small size for hikers to carry on the trail.  The fit is very good, and the jacket is very comfortable.  Attached to the jacket was the manufacturer's tag showing a price of $195.  Although I probably would not pay that amount, I am absolutely delighted to have gotten this jacket from Amazon for just under $70.  I bought one in yellow to give me some visibility during my daily walks."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),"Great Jacket, Great Price!",5,"Bought this for hubby because he hasn't had a real winter jacket in years. He's not a typical Tommy Hilfiger type, so we did not choose this for the brand -- it was the right size with the right features at the right place. We had a major cold snap this week, and it kept him super cozy. It will be perfect for our trip to Canada next year!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Inaccurate Shade of Yellow,1,"I fell for the bright shade of yellow depicted in the photo,  but in reality it is a much duller and darker variant of yellow, which is not what I was after.  Instead of photoshopping the colors to make them look like something they are not, aim for photos that is closest to the real thing. It would have worked nicely otherwise."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),"Wish they made a Tall Medium, but otherwise a great jacket",4,"My husband really likes this jacket and it looks good on him.  The large size is long enough in the arms and waist (he's 6'2""), but too big for his skinny 167 pound body.  That's the story of his life---nobody sells a Tall Medium.  When a jacket is too wide for him, wind blows up his back.  We had hoped that the stretchy bottom on the jacket would prevent that, but he's just too narrow.  So we paid $20 to have the sides sewn, taking about 3 inches of material off each side, and now he's happy and warm.  This is a very well made jacket and would be a perfect ""5"" if they offered a Tall Medium.  Still, we're happy with the purchase.  Delivery etc was great."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),2XLT was actually a Large Tall,1,"The tag on the sleeve was a 2XLT. That was fantastic.  BUT the jacket actually was a Large Tall.  Now my husband at first was crushed that the 2XLT was so tight when he zipped it (great arms length etc.).  BUT he was super happy when he realized he ZIPPED UP a Large.  Sadly, we had already spent the money to get a 3XLT - which was super huge. If they sent the CORRECT Jacket in the first place, we would have not had all these issues, spent all this money on 2 coats...and now packaging and returning."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Packable Puffer Jacket (Regular),5,"This is a very well made jacket with pockets that are deep, zippered and well located.  It is also very attractive and is durable.  I am 5ft 7 inch with a 44 inch chest, 34 inch waist and weigh 170 lbs.  The medium size fit me perfectly."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),I Love This Jacket - Go Put in your Cart Now,5,I bought the Yellow/Navy Color with the Hilfiger log on the neck sleeve and I love it.  I'm 5'9 a muscular physique 180 pounds and the Large fits me perfectly without wearing a heavier sweater.  On the verge of being tight fitting when I put anything bulky underneath.  You can wear this jacket in up to 30 degree weather and you should be fine even without layering it with sweaters.  I get compliments every time i wear it.  Worth every penny for $60 bucks.
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),This is an authentic jacket not a knock-off.,5,I bought this jacket for my son and it looks and fit as expected. We originally saw it at the Tommy Outlet Store for more than the price of these and the design is the same.
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),It looks so beautiful 😊,5,"Well well, I have just received my winter jacket, shipping was fast and packing was wonderful. I’m a woman, 5.4ft, 130lb and I ordered a small, because I wasn’t sure how to measure men’s size. It is a little bit loose, but I’m going to keep it because I will be putting in a few layers and sometimes my hands get so cold, because I don’t like to wear gloves, but if they have a xsmall, go for it. I will be ordering another one in xsmall and in a different color. I love the feel. Let me upload a picture when I’m wearing it. I hope my review helps someone out there. Good luck"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Weather acceptable,5,This jacket was purchased for someone who is only about 5' tall and very small framed. He loves the fit as he can put other items on under it without it being bulky. He loves that the color goes with various items and is very warm. Even in bus stop weather at 15 degrees. For the price and quality it was worth it. Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice all around weather jacket that can work in the cold and mild weather.
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Piec of crap jacket- material shred apart soon after purchase!,1,Piece of crap produxt.  Bought it for my Dad and thought it was a genuine Tommy Hildiger but the item started shredding apart just over 1 month after owning it and it was just 2 days past the 30 days to return and there was non additional in stock of the puffer jacket.  Most disappointed product I’ve ever bought on Amazon especially to be a brand name like Tommy!
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),I would buy this again,5,"My husband is so very picky about what he will wear I rarely buy him clothes of any kind. He seemed to like a similar jacket that I have so I thought I would get him one and hope for the best.  I'm so glad I did, he loves the coat, how it fits, keeps him warm, comfortable and light weight. I would recommend to anyone."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),The best jacket for between the seasons!,5,"An excellent product: light, warm, nice color, inside pocket and outside pockets with zipper. It is very convenient for the phone, ear buds, keys, etc. it would be better if it has a hood which can be concealed inside of the jacket: just in case of sudden rain, or for a short walk from (inside) home to the car or other means of transportation."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Lived up to the expectation,5,"I always wanted to buy a Tommy Hilfiger jacket and this one was a great opportunity. Loved the color. It is very light and extremely comfortable. Fits perfectly fine. In my previous jacket, my hand movements were restricted by the less space and weird fitting, but this one feels great. Another great part about this jacket is the ease with which I can carry this. I would recommend this product for someone looking to invest in a good jacket."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),"What type of jacket it is , winter , fall , spring !",1,"The description makes you think it’s a winter jacket and it’s not it’s a spring, fall jacket and my son needed a winter jacket I had to order another jacket from Macy’s and the only reason I didn’t return it to amazon is my son likes it so I let him keep it , he is a senior and can wear it to school"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Expected more from the jacket.,3,"I measured myself on the table that goes to the product and ordered the size of XL. In fact, it turned out to be big. The quality is so-so, it’s sewn well, the fabric is normal, but there are threads sticking all over the jacket. It seems to me that it shouldn’t be on a branded thing like Tommy Hilfiger."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Down material comes out,2,"I rarely write reviews... however, I felt the need to provide one here. The jacket looks nice. It fits nice. However, when compressed or other items are pressed against it, the down material comes out through the jacket shell. It's very bizarre. When you look at the jacket, it looks like there is a bunch of stingy cotton material stuck to the outside of the jacket. I would probably forgo this jacket and get one that is more reputable. Of course, I did not realize the jacket would do this until after the return window. So, I am stuck with it."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Great lightweight snow/ski jacket for a discounted price,4,This is a great lightweight winter jacket that is made to be folded up into a small pouch for easy carrying. It's very warm considering how lightweight the jacket is. I've used it in 20 to 30 degree weather with no issues. Would be ideal for backpacking where you can pack it away in case really bad weather comes in.
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Not the same product on the pictures,3,"The jacket is really nice. My friend order the black one and i really liked it, that decided to get it too. The this is that when mine came in, it had a circle logo on the left shoulder. I talked to customer service to see if they could send me one without like the one my friend got, and they made another order and the second one came with the logo on the side too… i was also looking at the pictures on the reviews and none of them have it. Im thinking is new inventory, but they have not updated the pictures online."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),"Zipper not functioning, complete waste of money .

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),"Light, packable and versatile",5,"I got one for myself and one for my son. It's very packable (in a small bag that comes with it), doesn't take much space in a back-pack and I use it for layering when hiking and sailing. It's light but warm, and fits nicely under a rainshell or as a top layer. Also looks very sharp around a city."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Cheap zipper - Nice jacket,2,"Great jacket. I get lots of compliments about it. Just the main zipper broke within twice of wearing it. I am talking about the metal part, not the actual zipping mechanism"

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),"Looks good, quality good, sizes a bit small",5,"The white looks great.

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Good but the zipper head has a minor problem,4,"Overall, I like this. Warm and super comfy. There is an inside pocket too. However, the zipper head is not functioning perfectly. I have to ""carefully and completely"" zip the jacket, or sometimes the bottom zipper line would just split, then I have to re-zip the jacket (and sometimes it is hard to split the whole zipper at first)."

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Ultra Loft Lightweight Packable Puffer Jacket (Standard and Big & Tall),Goodlooking but too delicate,2,"Jacket is warm and looks amazing on my husband, but it’s terribly fragile.

Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Nice looking work jacket.,4,"Had to replace my husbands old denim jacket that he had for so many years.  This is a different brand than then the other one, but looks like it.  This jacket is made very well except for the fact that when we went to unbutton to try it on we had a very had time getting the buttons undone.  Once we did I had to clip some of the threads to make it easier for next time.  On the top pockets you can see a faint line right aross, but only notice if you are looking for it.  Does not really take away from the jacket.  Husband is very pleased and we would definitely purchase another one in the future."
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,A heavyweight denim with a toasty warm lining,5,"This is a great denim jacket.  I’ve loved my unlined Wrangler Denim Jacket for the past twenty five years, and still wear it.  But I decided I wanted to have a warmer version for cold nights or days.  I ordered this jacket and I was really happy with the blanket lining.  It’s a nice thick lining.  It’s not too bulky, but really adds warmth.  The weight of the denim jacket is nice and thick and cuts the wind pretty well.  On top of that, Wrangler denim fades really nicely over time, only getting better with age.  I really like this jacket a lot.  The lighter colored corduroy color is okay.  I would have preferred the classic blue denim collar, but the light corduroy looks a little sharper for wearing out to dinner, if that makes a difference to you."
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Great little jacket,5,"Jacket fits great. The sleeves are perfect,not too long, not too short. The chest is a little loose but acceptable. Nice heavy denim. This Jacket has the true blanket lining. Wrangler sells another jacket with a ""blanket lining"" that to me is just thin flannel. The only thing I really don't care for is the collar, which is a tan corduroy type material. I would have preferred just regular blue denim. People have complained that the buttons are too stiff and they had to snip the threads in the button holes. The buttons are stiff,  but after using for a week they are starting to loosen on their own. The jacket is warm for 30+degree temperatures. Anything colder may need a heavier coat. All in all I believe this jacket is well worth the price"
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Good heavy weight jacket,4,"Got this to replace my old one which was a large, this one is a 44 and not as big in the shoulders as my old one, and bottom pockets are not as deep. The quality and lining are the same as old one, if I could have got a 46 I would have. These lined jackets are hard to find, and inside pockets would be a plusIt is a great spring and fall jacket for outside work and that is what I got it for. As you can see in the picture my old one has seen it’s dayHappy to find this one"
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Wrangler western denim jacket,5,"It's a very excellent quality jacket. Love the blanket liner for added comfort. The only issue was the button fasteners are really tight to open  after working each one & trimming excess threads it buttons easily. The collar color is not a favorite of mine, dark color is more favorable. It's got enough room inside for a long sleeve shirt. The seams are reinforced. It's a western style @ a great price.."
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Just Like I Had In The 70's,5,I wore this same jacket from freshman in high school thru my senior year-I lived in Upper Michigan and this jacket worked great even in the winter.It is exactly what I remember with the Grey blanket lining and heavy denim-they show a different lining in the picture-but it is actually grey blanket.I am glad I finally found one
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Be Aware This Model Has A Pocket Defect,2,I purchased mine from Hays Inc. At first I was impressed by the quality but then once I got to a mirror I saw these weird lines below where the chest pocket snaps. The closer I look it seems like that is where the inside pocket seam ends. Fine but why the lines if it wasn't stitched down ? I then thought maybe I got a defect because the price was too good to be true. I looked at other websites and photos and see the same problem. It has to be a factory defect or a production error. Wrangler doesn't list this item on their website anymore. Maybe the lines will wash out and fade with the rest of the denim. Maybe not. Otherwise super tough quality and it is making me upset because I want a jacket like this.
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Great Denim Jacket,5,"Really like this one. First one was lined, button holes not big enough. This one is not lined but very comfortable. Only wish it had stitched Ws on pockets and/ or Wrangler label on pocket. Has pockets inside jacket, real handy. Very happy 😃"
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Bought as a gift for a buddy,5,"A friend came to help with some new fencing.  He wouldn't take money, so I figured I'd replace his old raggedy jacket with this.  The fit was perfect and since I'd already bought it, he couldn't argue much."
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,"This jacket is a quality product.  The fit, material, comfort, looks y price are all great.",5,"I like everything about the jacket, but especially the liner.  It provides all the warmth needed here.  Also I think it is good looking.  I definitely recommend it."
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,I love it,5,"I love this jacket. When I first pulled it out I thought it might be to short, but when I tried it on it fit perfectly. It is comfortable and warm. It is loose enough that you don't feel constricted but not so large you feel like it's baggy. It quickly became my favorite."
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Looks great on a man,5,My husband loves the jacket and it perfect because it has a liner inside that helps him stay outside in the cold longer without any discomfort. Love the fit and look

Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,would not buy,1,I am 6'2 -- ordered a 44. Jacket runs small. Be prepared to spend a lot of time just opening the buttons.

Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Great coat,5,Love it
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Old School Classic,5,This jacket is a country classic. Warm and tough. I ordered two sizes too big and it fit perfect.
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Unexpected problem with sleeves,4,"We replaced an old jacket that my husband has had since the 1980s.  His was a Rustler Brand. The two jackets are nearly identical.  The two fit the same in the body area. The sleeves are different however. The sleeves from the 1980s Rustler jacket have a polyester lining that is a slippery material and that makes it easy to put on.  The new jacket has the blanket lining in the sleeves which makes the sleeves tight and very difficult for my husband to slide his arms into and move his arms.  Consequently, when he pulls one out of the closet, he is still choosing to wear the old jacket, so I will probably begin a new search for a Rustler brand jacket for him.  The old one is in such bad shape, it has to go..."
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Good fit,5,"Love my jacket, I use it daily."
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,looks great,5,I normally would buy a medium but reading other reviews they said it ran a little small. I also wanted a little extra room so I could also wear a sweater  without it binding. I would like small plastic strip inserted into the end of the collar would hold it shape better. I would give this as a present because of the quality

Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Well made Wrangler Jacket,3,I love Wrangler products. The denim in this jacket is heavy and the blanket lining is nice too. But the sizing! I wear a 46-48 jacket. Read the reviews suggesting go one size up up. So I ordered the 50. It was too small. Tight in the shoulders. Arm length was good and the waist was fine. Had to send it back.

Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,this item is sized a FULL SIZE TOO SMALL,1,"even though Amazon notes 84% ""fit as expected"" among purchasers of this item, It is a FULL size too small.  I have never had to size up to 42 reg in my life - very disappointed in having to return the jacket.."
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,This jacket has three defects!,1,This jacket has three defects. The first important left breast pocket is not sewn to the end! Stitched pleats on the shoulder. Size does not fit in relation to the sizes of the Amazon! It's too big!
Wrangler Men's Regular Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Great jacket,5,Great jacket. Last one lasted me 18 years. Keeps you warm and sheds the rain. Good price for a great jacket.
Venado Concealed Carry Jacket for Men - Heavy Duty Canvas - Conceal Carry Pockets,Super sharp and well fitted!,5,"Great sturdy material that still allows flexibility in movement. Super handsome on my husband! The fit is nice enough where it doesn't look baggy and oversized so he can wear it for ""good"" too! The colored patch on the pocket and Venado buttons add a nice touch. The zipper is super heavy duty (like a Carhartt!) and there are 4 inner conceal pockets for left or right handed users. The magazine pockets would be great for a multitool or knife as well. Can't wait for him to wear this out and about."
Venado Concealed Carry Jacket for Men - Heavy Duty Canvas - Conceal Carry Pockets,The color makes it a dust magnet,3,"I purchased and returned this jacket for several reasons.  First though, it's a nice cut with some good features, like the heavy canvas fabric and the lining and pockets. Second, I've been looking for a CCW jacket to make it easier to access my firearm when riding in a vehicle.Unfortunately, while the jacket has some good features it also has features that make it unsuitable for me, starting with the color.  I've never been a fan of really dark colors because I'm a night owl.  I'm usually up until the wee hours and that's when you're likely to find me out and about.  I don't like being invisible to anyone driving if I'm on the side of the road. Top that with three cats and a fabric that seems to attract fur like a magnet and I'd have to keep a lint roller in one of the pistol pockets.  Speaking of the pistol pockets, I wish they'd put a little more work into them, maybe tapering them and anchoring them better.  Yes, they hold my full-sized 9mm (4.5"" barrel) and they also hold my little S&W Shield 45 (with the mag pockets being an awesome design with pull tabs for easy mag access, even with the short Shield mags), but the firearm itself tends to flop around a lot if you wear the jacket open, which was my intent unless it got really cold.  The placement of the pistol pocket on the left chest also meant that the firearm would be banging right on my cell phone (normally carried in my shirt).  That's simply not going to cut it for me.Oh, and the jacket seems to run just slightly smaller than true-to-size so, just like how you need to size up your pants' waistband to carry IWB, so too here do you need to go up a size if you're going to carry a pistol in this. That being said, if you just want the jacket for the pockets (the pistol pockets, being rectangular and canted with a retention strap would hold a phone very securely and easy access) and the style, go for it, it's well made and looks/feels very durable."
Venado Concealed Carry Jacket for Men - Heavy Duty Canvas - Conceal Carry Pockets,Top notch conceal carry jacket!,5,Feels like a durable well built jacket! Fit is excellent for me at 6’ 240 lbs. Holds my ccw very securely and the pull tab mag pockets are awesome! Haven’t worn in cold weather yet but seems like it should be fairly warm as well.
Venado Concealed Carry Jacket for Men - Heavy Duty Canvas - Conceal Carry Pockets,Great Jacket - Would make a very good Christmas gift,5,"To put it simple I couldn’t be happier.I used to buy a Carhartt every other year however I switched it up this time when I stumbled upon this Venado jacket on Amazon. I was skeptical because of the amount of reviews (I think there was 7) but decided to go ahead and try it out. Well I’m glad I did because this is going to be my new favorite jacket! It’s more comfortable in my opinion, has concealed carry pockets, and it is very durable.I plan to buy more and get embroidered for my staff to wear.Glock 26 fits great insideI hope the team at Verado expands the jacket line with more available colors to choose from. Maybe a light brown, navy blue, and/or dark green with a little 2 tone going on. So I can get another in a different color.Fits great.I got an XL. 190LBS- 5’11”I like it a little loose, below the belt line, and plan to wash/dry it so expect it to shrink just a little."
Venado Concealed Carry Jacket for Men - Heavy Duty Canvas - Conceal Carry Pockets,Two things,3,"I like this jacket for colder days but there's two things wrong with it. The first is the sleeves are smaller then normal. It is not comfortable to wear a long sleeve shirts with this jacket. I don't have abnormally large arms either. I think maybe quality control is slipping at the manufacturing. I've noticed other garments sold on Amazon from Oriental countries are substandard as well and I have completely stopped buying clothes on Amazon because of it. Didn't used to be that way but it is now. The second thing is it's not practical to carry any weapon larger then a compact small caliber. The weapons hand grip protrudes so much it looks like (if your a man) you have breasts. if your a woman - well I can image how uncomfortable it would be. If your buying this jacket solely for concealed carry for a gun larger then a compact 380, you'll be disappointed."
Venado Concealed Carry Jacket for Men - Heavy Duty Canvas - Conceal Carry Pockets,"It says to say what's important to know on the headline. Too me, I just really like it.",5,"I bought this after I bought their CC vest and a couple of their shirts. I bought two more of their shirts after this. The carry pockets are just a touch on the small side but work. This is a top quality product from a company that seems to have nothing less.  I can't really speak of just this coat because everything I have bought from them fits well, performs well and they just look really good and more expensive than they really are. This coat won't do on it's own for those super cold mid-west days, but throw on one of their heavy flannel shirts or sweatshirts underneath and maybe the vest in the extremes and you'll be pretty comfy and look good at the same time. The only thing I wish they added to the coat was a removeable hood."

Venado Concealed Carry Jacket for Men - Heavy Duty Canvas - Conceal Carry Pockets,I can't believe I only paid $150 for this coat.,5,"Once in a while, if you do your due diligence, you run into something that's really special. This is one of those. I knew I was going to like this coat before I even took it out of it's packaging. The weight of it impressed me 1st. The feel of it was a close second. The look is amazing. The materials are top notch. The fit is perfect. The workmanship is impressive. Everything they said it would be; even much, much more. In summary, Way past my expectations.P.S. I would have paid double for this coat."
Venado Concealed Carry Jacket for Men - Heavy Duty Canvas - Conceal Carry Pockets,Order a size larger,4,Nice jacket but not truly concealed.  If the coat isn’t zipped up you can see the weapon.  Coat really doesn’t have the  extra room needed to disguise the fact you’re carrying.  Had I known these things I would not have purchased the coat. Otherwise it’s a nice enough coat.
Venado Concealed Carry Jacket for Men - Heavy Duty Canvas - Conceal Carry Pockets,Great gift idea,5,Very pleased with the material and how comfortable it is. Also I do like the ambidextrous feature you can carry you’re side arm on either side. Ive had mine over a year and still hands down one of my favorite jackets. Definitely a great gift. Price is very fair compared to other jackets. And you also get a magazine holder on both sides.
Venado Concealed Carry Jacket for Men - Heavy Duty Canvas - Conceal Carry Pockets,New go to coat for cold weather!,5,"I originally bought the vest and liked it so much that I bought the coat.

Just wish the coat came in brown."

Venado Concealed Carry Jacket for Men - Heavy Duty Canvas - Conceal Carry Pockets,Very Comfortable,5,"This is my first time purchasing a canvas jacket, and wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I've tried some on some of the other brands at stores, but decided on Venado's. Glad I did. Jacket feels comfortable, warm, heavy duty, and I'm a big fan of the comfortable cuffs. They don't let the cool draft up your sleeve, and neither does the longer backside of the jacket. I'm about 6'3"", 225 and the XXL fits me great. I usually run into trouble with jackets, because when I bend over, my lower back gets exposed to the cold air. Not with this jacket. The 'concealed pockets' also fit well, cough cough.  Don't think you can go wrong here."
Venado Concealed Carry Jacket for Men - Heavy Duty Canvas - Conceal Carry Pockets,Heavy Duty and Warm,5,Seems like a high quality piece. Very warm and well-made.

adidas Men's Tiro 21 Track Jacket,Pretty but beware,3,"It is kind of large on the sleeves and waist, i am 1,72 mts and 82kg, so its supposed to be medium size. But despite of that it looks nice.However the fabrics are not too good.. my jacket has some marks that looks like the thread has started to tore apart. And only has like 3 weeks old.That is really bad for me, and it is worst because it is not a cheap jacket.I have an under armour jacket and a peak velocity and none of those has showed this kind of tearing."

adidas Men's Tiro 21 Track Jacket,Fits looser and larger than normal,3,"I like the jacket, looks nice very clean. But the fit is complete crap. The sleeves are way longer than I think they should be it fits way too loose for a track jacket.

adidas Men's Tiro 21 Track Jacket,Good Jacket but sleeves are long,3,"Good jacket and nice material.

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Nice jacket - here's help with sizing.,5,"Had a hard time figuring out what size to get, so I'm going to try to help by giving my son's measurements and the size I ordered:I ordered US size MediumChest: 38 1/2""Waist: 34""Hips"" 36""Sleeve: 23"" (shoulder seam to wrist)Height: 5'8""Weight : 150 lbs.My son is slender with long arms and legs, compared to his torso.Hope this helps others.The jacket itself is very nice. It had an odor when it first came out of the shipping bag. I hung it out in the room air for a couple days and it is fine now. The hoodie that zips out is a true gray color. It seems well made, though my son has not worn it except to try it on because it is still too warm here. It is actually heavier than I thought it was. It is lined well with a quilted nylon, and made of a faux leather."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Nice Jacket, decent tailoring. Great present 🎁 update 2/10/18 Already damaged on sleeves from light wear! Not cool",3,"This is a really cool coat I bought as a gift for my husband. I looked over the stitching and quality of the product and I am very satisfied. For a faux leather jacket it still has a nice smooth feeling texture and seems like it was made to last. The zippered in hood is a pretty cool feature but that was the only part my Husband was not so fond of. He says he will be leaving it on for now but stated a flannel lining in place of the hood would have made this the perfect Jacket. Overall this is a purchase I am glad I made and I will update in a year on how well it holds up.Update: February 10thMy husband has owned this coat for just over 1 month now. He wears it to and from work mostly and occasionally out and about town. He recently discovered both sleeves are looking damaged with frayed seams and the outer faux leather shredding. What a bummer! Do to this fact I have to change my review from4 stars to 3. It’s comfortable, keeps him warm enough for travel but it comes apart far to quickly and easily.I"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Great jacket,5,"This is my new favorite jacket. I don’t know why people are saying it runs small, I got my my normal size (large) and fits fine. 6’2 185"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Nice Product, Didn't Last Long",3,"I like the fit and style of the jacket. It's nice and warm and being able to remove the hoodie for a different look is a plus. My biggest upset is after having it maybe a month and a half and taking great care of the jacket, the pleather is lifting off on my right sleeve. Some areas of the jacket appear more worn than others (most likely for effect) but I think this is what made the arm more susceptible to peeling. Considering the price of the jacket, I would have hoped for a longer life before such things would occur."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Nice well made! seems sturdy and just the right thickness that's what she said, my wife that is",5,"This is definitely a killer deal. I read through nearly all the reviews because I have such an issue ordering coats that are the right size because of my body which is crafted by God himself has less than conventional size issues, alright I'm kind of chubby. Anyways that's beside the point the jacket is awesome, it fits perfectly because I ordered a size above actually I ordered two sizes above I normally wear a 2X and I ordered the 4X and it fits perfectly, I'm definitely going to stay gold in this jacket Ponyboy. It's nice, it's materials feel sturdy as well as the zippers and the inner lining. I ordered the Lite version and it's plenty thick so unless you live in an area that gets muy Frio I'd recommend ordering the Lite version. Ill update in a week from now to let you know how it's holding up, but as far as right now I'm definitely have 0 buyer's remorse."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Excellent jacket but be careful with the size,5,"I am 6'6"" and thin with a medium length torso and long arms and legs. I fretted a lot over the size, and ultimately went with the XXL -- PERFECT fit. And I do mean perfect. Now bear in mind I am typically a Large (ideally a Large-tall) so the sizing for this jacket is very atypical. It is a very lean cut jacket and the larger sizes stay VERY trim in the torso.The jacket itself looks great and is solidly built. I read some reviews complaining about the buttons which secure the hood insert popping off, but I think that's due to people trying to hang it by the hood. Don't do that, it's not designed that way. Hanging it by the hood puts the weight of this fairly heavy coat on just the 3 buttons (and not the interior zipper) which isn't really intended use and sort of common sense if you examine the thing.I went with the less heavy version and it's still quite warm and completely windproof -- perfect for cold fall weather. The zippers are a little rough/sharp but not overly so, and do seem durable. Pockets are spacious, the interior breast pocket is a plus. It will definitely smell of plastic for a few days after you get it, but it just needs to be properly aired out and then it's fine. Overall, but especially for the price, this is a fantastic jacket."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Great price for quality,4,"Has anyone washed there's yet?? If so, how did it hold up? Any tips??Bought this for my 11yr old son.  The quality and price is perfect.  The only complaint I have is the sweatshirt is already fraying up after two wears.  Disappointed, but we'll see if I can fix that.  Otherwise, my son is ecstatic!"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Trash Jacket & Trash Customer Service From Wantdo,1,"I bought this jacket because I liked the look of it. I wish I had never wasted my money. After 6 months of light wear, the leather around the seams on the sleeves started cracking and peeling. I dealt with it. After 9 months of light wear, the zipper started catching and wouldn't zip. After a year of light wear, the zipper completely broke. I contacted Amazon about what could be done for a replacement, as Wantdo touts their ""amazing customer service."" Amazon told me to talk to Wantdo. Wantdo told me to talk to Amazon. It's been a run around with no one really wanting to own up to selling a substandard product. If you're okay with dropping $70 on a jacket that won't even last a year, then by all means, buy it. But if you value customer service and companies doing what is right, don't waste your time with this jacket or this company - they are both absolute and utter garbage."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"This is a great jacket, good quality",5,"I ordered the jacket in black and the heavy option as I wanted something warm for winter. I Should also state that I am a girl and wanted a jacket of this style without it stopping at my middrift or the arms not fitting properly. After searching for hours for womens jackets that weren't belly shirts, I decided to look at men's. This is a great jacket, good quality. You can unzip the hood and the lining so many different layering options. I would normally order a large for a winter coat so sweaters could fit under, but I ordered a XL after reading reviews stating it ran small. I believe this also comes from an Asian company and clothes usually run smaller there. XL fit perfectly, arms are the right length and the jacket hit at my hip line. For a girl the shoulders might be a bit bulky beacuse its not cut to fit that way, but overall it is a very stylish, warm, and comfortable jacket. I would buy again in a different color."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Solid buy!,5,"Okay, so first off: i’m 5’9”, and about 170-175ish. shoulders are kind of broad, build is skinnyish, and i’m out of shape lolfor this, a Medium worked perfectly, as the size chart indicated (40 inch chest).as you can see, the hood is a real hood, not pointy, and with lots of room. it can even cover my eyes a little without much effort, and i have a big ol’ long head :pthe length is ever so slightly longer than normal in the torso, which i like. pulling it all the way down makes it just touch my upper thigh. (of course, it doesn’t wear at that exact spot since jackets ride up a little)sleeves are slightly long as per the style, but not overly so like most jackets (i.e. you can fit your hands inside when they are cold, but it doesn’t get super baggy when you don’t).the jacket fits well through the torso while still leaving some room for a hoodie.in terms of warmth: definitely a “medium” weight jacket unless otherwise specified: it kept me warm on a 1-2 hour long walk at about 45 degrees in North Texas, wearing the jacket and a t shirt. might need a beanie, still, if you’re cold natured and bald like i am :psolid jacket, especially for the price. definitely recommend it."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Bad zipper,3,"I’m going to get the bad out of the way. The zippers on these keep breaking under normal use. I’m an average build and weigh 160ish at 5’8”. The jacket I bought is a small. The zipper isn’t under any stress from a big belly and it just keeps breaking. I’ve bought 4 of these jackets. Two in the beginning of 2020 and two more in October. The ones from the beginning, the zippers broke on both. Now one of the ones from October have broke. The cloth that holds the zipper looks like it gets worn and won’t zip properly. I’ve looked at the zipper teeth thoroughly and none of them seem to be crooked or missing or out of place. The zipper keeps splitting at the beginning when you go to zip it up. I’m pretty fed up with this at this point. These are $70-$80 jackets that keep breaking and I just can’t keep replacing these. It’s a shame cause I really like this jacket when it works properly. It keeps me warm, dry, and keeps the wind out. It’s better than any rain jacket I’ve had, any winter jacket I’ve had, any “wind proof” jacket I’ve had, but this zipper issue is a dealbreaker for me. I would suggest looking elsewhere for another leather jacket. Something a little more expensive might be better quality that can last longer than 6-8 months.Edit: contacted the company at their website (not through Amazon) the same time I wrote this review. Explained the issue and told them how disappointed I was. They offered me a free jacket to replace the broken one, I accepted. The jacket has its flaws but I’m glad the company wanted to make it right. For this, I will bring my rating up from 1 star to 3 stars. This jacket is honestly a perfect 5 for me if not for the zipper issue"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Inconsistent sizing and buttons falling off,1,"I got this for my husband and it seemed like a really nice jacket - However, he wore it out to run an errand and a button fell off somewhere in that time so I don't think its very good quality at all. We asked for a replacememt jacket and when it came it fit him completely differently - the reviews seemed conflicting on the sizing and so that must be why - 2 med jackets but the replacement jacket is about an inch or so smaller all around than the first  was and so it doesn't fit him as comfortably as the 1st jacket.1 star for the look of the jacket but thats really it.Comfort is ok but my husband also said that the hoodie insert with the collar thats already on the jacket make it kind of bulky and irritating on his neck.Quality is lacking...I imagine the buttons will most likely come off on this replacement jacket since they already seem loose.For 70 bucks there are better deals and as such I wouldn't purchase this jacket again or recommend it.Updating to add: after 2 months ALL the buttons that are used to attach the hoodie insert piece have fallen off."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Good-Great jacket with some caveats.,4,"So this coat was a weird experience for me. I have been wanting to get a nice leather/faux leather jacket for a while and when this was on sale for Cyber Monday I decided to snag it. I got it for $42 instead of the normal $70, which plays into my rating here.1st of all I ordered the Black(heavy) version both because I thought it was the best looking one and because it was the only one on sale, but that IS NOT what I received. I received a Brown one (I think it is the coffee(heavy) one, but not sure). I was going to send it back but my wife said she thought the brown one looked really good on me and since it fits me well enough (always a concern when buying clothes you don't get to try on 1st) I decided to just let it be and keep the brown one. So my rating takes a bit of a hit there.As for fit, I was nervous just because of how inconsistently sized clothes tend to be online. I am 6' tall, about 250lbs with most of my extra size in my stomach/spare tire region. Generally speaking 2XL fits me just right but sometimes with outerwear it's good to buy 1 size up and based on some of the reviews I considered doing that here, but I'm glad that I didn't.The fit is a bit unique but not horrible. The sleeves are a couple inches longer than I expected (probably at least 3XL length) but that is fine because they stay in place with the fabric cuffs at the wrist. It fits just right and exactly as expected in the shoulders and upper chest. It is smaller/tighter than expected covering my stomach(closer to an XL size there). It could stand to be a couple inches longer as it fits just right length wise (again probably XL length) until you move around/bend over/reach up etc... overall the fit is very comfortable when unzipped, and not perfect but acceptable when zipped up.As for the quality it is better then expected for the $42 I paid for it, but would probably just as expecte if I paid the full $70. Sometimes these faux-leather materials can feel/look a bit too plasticky or shiny like vinyl, but this one does not. It's very nice and soft. There are a some loose dangling threads on the stitching which is disappointing but fixable. The 3 buttons that hold the head part of the hood in place seem a bit flimsy and like they aren't stitched into place very securely and after reading some of the other reviews I've come to the conclusion that I'll likely have to replace them eventually. My biggest from a quality perspective however is the zippers, they definitely feel like they are significantly lower quality than the rest of the jacket. I haven't had any problems with them yet but considering that they seem to be the most commonly cited problem in the reviews and the fact that they feel lightweight I'm very worried that they will break down the road, hopefully being extra careful with them will help.Overall I really like this coat a lot, it's comfortable, very warm, and it looks great. It loses 1 star because of getting sent the wrong color, the strange/inconsistent fit, and the poor quality zippers and buttons. None of those issues are bad enough on their own but all together they knock off a star. If you can get this coat on sale it is definitely worth it, but at full price I might look elsewhere."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Zipper broke, Wantdo refused to fix.",1,"I bought this jacket in September and didn't really use it until November. After only about two months of use, the main front zipper broke and separates any time I zip it up. I contacted Wantdo to see if they would repair or replace it and they said no, just that I can get 20% off another jacket. Ha! No thanks.It's too bad because it looks great and the ""leather"" material actually seems pretty high quality. It does fit well/as expected and is pretty warm. It's not going to keep you toasty through a Chicago winter but down to about 40 degrees or so it's great."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Great jacket without breaking the bank,5,"This worked really well, survived the tough New England winter. It kept me quite warm, between the liner and thick inside, and being able to zip both liner and jacket was great. The hood added that extra comfort during snow/rain or cold wind. When it started to warm up, I removed the liner and hood and it made the jacket even lighter. But with the liner it was heavy enough without being bulky. All the main zippers were strong metal and worked well.I'll address my experience with the two complaints I saw in the reviews. First is size. I wear XL to XXL shirt (depending on the brand/size) since I have large shoulders, and the XL jacket fit snug and left enough movement for comfort. So I think it fits well. Second is the fake leather wearing/rip marks. So this is fake leather, not real, and for the price I'm not too concerned with some minor wear signs. For 95% of the jacket there was no wear at all. The only place I saw the wear was in the bottom of the sleeves, which is where I think others had issues with as well. I found the reason for this was the large pockets with strong metal zipper sticking out a bit. So when walking my arms would swing and rub against those zippers. I found that if I don't have my hands in my pockets and close the zippers, it doesn't happen anymore. So that would be my suggestion for anyone purchasing this jacket."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Zipper sucks but the jacket rules,3,"Okay so I'm going to change my rating.  I have to deny it one more star.  The problem with the zipper is too much.  The zipper for the hood broke off and now it won't even go on.  Both sides of the zipper have links missing and the hood is what completes the jacket.  Pretty disappointed considering the other zippers are perfectly fine and are made of metal or whatever, but the ones for the hood are these really weak plastic pieces.Love the jacket.  Hate the zipper.  Damn...."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Well worth the price on sale!,5,"Very nice jacket, great look and perfect fit.Seems like some reviews say to order a size larger than normal but very glad I stayed with my usual size (small).  This fits me perfectly.  Sometimes with jackets I have to get a Medium because the sleeves on the Smalls are too short but these sleeves are great, longer than needed actually.  If I had bought a M it would have been way too big on the shoulders and I assume way too long on the sleeves too.I bought a black ""heavy"" one and it seems warm enough for Fall/early winter temps down to the 40s.  Hood fits great and a welcome addition to use in the rain.  Hood itself is very warm & that material makes my neck sweat odd to say, but will be toasty when cold out.Can't speak for the construction holding up since have only worn it a few times but arrived with no visible flaws."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Value For Money,5,"Giving my review after using it for 6 months.Good Quality Jacket at the great price. stitching is good no problem with stitching. Fit me perfectly.  It is comfortable to wear and look stylish. warm enough to wear it outside. The hoodie is removable which is a good option. this is the best option at this price point.Sizing Guide- I bought Size LargeMy measurements - Height 6'1 , Chest- 40, Waist- 36, Weight- 184 lbs"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Game Changer,5,"This jacket is EVERYTHING. It has changed my life, no kidding. I have about a dozen jackets because I have autism and have trouble finding comfy and sturdy jackets that look good and work in different kinds of weather. This jacket covers all the bases. It's so comfortable; your sleeves don't catch/bunch because the material inside is perfect for just slipping on. It doesn't get sweaty, even when it's a bit warm (also because of that material inside) but keeps you warm in the cold. The look is original because it's a leather jacket without the douchiness that wearing a leather jacket adds. It's casual, but can be ""dressed up"". It doesn't smell gross like most leather and fake leather. It's the perfect length (you don't accidentally sit on it). LOVE this jacket. Thinking about ordering a second in case, God forbid something happen to this one."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Very stylish, but the zipper immediately will break",1,"I get lots of compliments about this jacket. The materials and craftmanship are good quality. However, the zipper breaks within a few months. The first time, I thought maybe it was just a random problem, so I returned the jacket and got a replacement. A month and a half later... the zipper is broken again. The point of a jacket is to keep you warm, so it's pointless to get one if the zipper isn't going to last. You zip up, and then it just separates completely."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Sizing is Odd, but the Jacket is Nice",4,"Based on other reviews, I went ahead and ordered a size up. I am 5'10"", 160 lbs. with a very slim frame - I thought I'd get a small, but I went up to a medium. I guess it's my frame because the shoulders and chest area felt a bit too baggy for me. I'll qualify that by saying I prefer slimmer cuts for my clothes in general.The jacket itself feels very good. The quilted lining looks sharp, it's well-padded and maybe even a bit warmer than I need. Layer this with a light sweater and you should be all set for winter. The zippers' movements could be smoother, and I had to trim off some loose strings when I first got it, but those are non-issues given the good price of this jacket. It does have a bit of an odd smell when it first comes out of the package - almost like new car smell but a little more pungent. I'm sure airing it out will help.I'll be ordering a small to compare fits."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Fantastic Affordable Product!!!,5,"Great Jacket man! It really feels well built I got the Black Heavy Jacket size XL I'm 6' 2"" and about 240Lbs I've got a fairly large chest and fairly large arms and Pretty big ""Love Handles"" with a slight stomach not big big but it is still a big stomach and it isn't tight on me with it unzipped it actually fits PERFECT unzipped,but once i zip it up it is definitely right on the verge of being too tight in fact I will most likely not wear it zipped until I lose about 10-15 more lbs.I would say I should've gotten an XXL yeah I'd be able to zip it up and it not look tight but when It's unzipped (Which is how I'll be wearing it 90% of the time I feel as if it would be much too big.I wish there was a size in between XL and XXL i know i may sound insane to some people saying this but it really is easier for me to just accept the XL and lose 10-15 lbs than to get an XXL. Everyone's body type is of course different but I'm just telling you my Story/Body type in the hopes it will help someone out there.Good luck everyone and enjoy this incredible Jacket!"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Warm coat with many flaws that don't make it worth the hassle,2,"Pros - the coat is very warm; you won't be able to go inside anywhere while wearing it, because it is so warm.  It is definitely a winter coat.Cons - Buttons fell off early on; jacket doesn't stay zipped up, creating a lot of problems for someone without a pair of pliers immediately availableI really wanted to like this coat.  It was my first winter coat since coming back from Iraq, and I really wanted to like it.  The hood is large and soft, but good luck keeping it on, when the zippers like to get stuck and the buttons literally fell off the coat.  I take good care of my stuff, and this coat was hung up on a hanger every night, never getting caught on anything, never being tossed on a couch or chair.  Buttons, though?  Woosh, falling off within maybe thirty days of ownership.I thought, ""Okay, I'll just have them sewn back on.""  But before that could happen, my zippers started failing.  Even with adding some graphite to the zippers (Mind you, this was early days, just trying to get the zippers to actually work), the coat won't stay zipped up fully.  Under the zipper, I might have just been wearing a cape, as easily as the coat would fly open, ignoring the amount of energy and effort I had to put in just to zip it up in the first place.I didn't even need to wear it much--maybe I've worn it 10 times, since buying it a few months back.Please, save your money, buy something a little bit better.  Wantdo was a foray into trying to give an unknown company a chance.  But I'd be better off with a well-known American brand name, and you will be too, trust me."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Nice jacket,4,"Got this for my husband for his birthday, his old jacket was a little too worn out. He's 6'0"" and about 155, I bought him a large...fits him perfectly! The detachable hood is nice, but personally I find the jacket sexier with the hood connected! Feels and looks nice and has plenty of pockets. Keep in mind that this is not real leather... So just be careful of doing things that might cause a tear or Knick the fabric. Would totally buy again if I had to!!"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Order Your Actual Size,5,"So, I love the jacket so far and i'm giving it 5 stars. I noticed some customers complained about the zippers but on the 2 that I ordered, the zippers worked fine. Maybe they improved the construction of them over time. As far as sizing goes, order the size you normally would. I'm 6'2"", 255-260lbs and the XL fits me perfectly. I ordered the 3XL the first time because i've order othered other clothing through Amazon and the largest size they offered ended up STILL being too small so despite the description of this jacket saying order your size, I figured it had to be off because the jacket goes up to 5XL! I sold the 3XL to a coworker and he loves it! So, in conclusion, my biggest advice to anyone is to order your actual size."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Sweet jacket and great price!!!,5,I'll make this very short and sweet I hope it helps. The jacket is fantastic. The quality is really really good and I bought a 3XL. I'm 6 ft 2 250 lb with large shoulders and long arms... A 2XL would have fit kind of snug the 3XL was just the right fit. I also wear a size 54 jacket and I have a 20 inch neck...this jacket looks sweet! Whether you dress it up or dress it down it works both ways. I tried it on with the hood and that I unzip the hood and used it to go out at night and I got complimented by my fiance. that's why I she's very picky LOL! I think for the price and the quality this is a great buy!
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Disappointed.....,2,"I hate having to make a review like this, but I gotta keep it real. The jacket looks super cool and fits almost perfectly (was a little too tight at first but I've been working out so it fits even better than before).HOWEVER, two MAJOR issues. One, I had to wait an extra month for it to finally ship because even though it said ""in stock"", there weren't any available. Two, and more importantly, you get what you pay for. After only a couple months, it's already begun to come apart at the seams under both of the armpits. Included are some perspective shots.I was willing to wait that extra shipping time because I was hoping the wait would be worth it. At first  it was; I love this little jacket. However, as you can see, I'm already in need of a new one. Ik I can get it fixed but I'd rather get something else that will last much longer."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Great jacket except for the TERRIBLE zippers,3,"This is a very nice looking jacket that is ruined by incredibly low quality zippers. I was tightening the front zipper with pliers every two weeks for a few months until it finally refused to zip at all, at which point it needed to be replaced. Assuming they are still being made with the same zippers, yours WILL break with regular use, it's only a matter of how long.If you are comfortable replacing the zipper yourself (or have a friend or family member who can help you out), it's a good deal. Otherwise, you will end up frustrated by this otherwise attractive jacket."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Good coat,5,"As a girl I thought this would be the perfect outdoor/barn wear/shop jacket, and it would be for a guy for sure. I ordered an XL and it was WAY to big, (I’m a big girl). I could have gone with a medium. I return this coat and went with something different, but if your a girl looking for a heavy, great quality coat for outdoorsy stuff this is a good choice. It gives horse girls the horse-girl look."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,It's really great for the price,5,"Everything is good about this jacket, so I'll talk about the not-so-good. First, the strings are different than the photos. Do I care? Not really, but good to know if it does for you. Second, the zipper is crap, it's nothing like a YKK but it works. Third, the fit of the jacket everywhere is perfect, except the waist, it is fairly baggy. So if you've a bit of a belly but nothing serious, this will still fit you well. But if you have an athletic build like me, you'll find the waist too baggy but the shoulders fit great"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Overall a good jacket for the price,4,"The coat fits slightly small for the size but otherwise the fit is great.  I got the warm version, and it's plenty warm.  The removable hood is nice, as I like the look of both.  My only complaints are the zippers and the pockets.  The zippers are very cheap.  They're sharp enough to tear little holes in the fabric over a matter of months.  Better quality zippers would greatly improve the overall quality.  The main hand pockets are also disappointingly small and shallow.  Barely enough room for your hands, let alone a pair of gloves or anything else.  I don't trust leaving keys or anything else in the pockets without zipping it up, which is slightly annoying.  There's room for deeper pockets, but for some reason they are very shallow.Overall, quite happy with my purchase after wearing the coat for some time.  Good quality, and looks nice."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Great material.  Issues with the zippers.,4,"Fits as expected.  It does use fake leather, but even after looking at it for a while and feeling it, you would fool most people that it is fake.  The stitching was well done suggesting it will last a while.  The main zipper has the slider on the left whereas all men's clothing has the slider on the right.  The 'chest' pocket sits low (bottom of the ribs).  I would've liked it to be high on the chest so you only have to unzip the jacket a few inches to reach inside the pocket.  The zippers for the pockets do not have a protective inner liner so they will easily scratch anything going in or out of your pocket (like a phone).  I loved the jacket, but knew that the zippers would bother me in the long run so I returned it."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,nice looking jacket but runs small,5,"Even though I had to return this because it was too small I loved the jacket on my grandson.  He normally wears a large but I had read some reviews  saying it ran small so I ordered the XL.  It fit him but he couldn't move his arms forward and all he had underneath when he tried it on was a t shirt so it would have been even tighter with a regular long sleeve shirt.  It's a really nice looking, well made jacket though and the leather feels nice.  My grandson complained about the zipper too.  It zips up on the opposite side of where men's jackets usually zip."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Great Jacket @ A great price.,4,"Update! Im removing a star because where the hood zippers to the jacket on the back of the neck it scratches you on the neck. A annoying & uncomfortable feeling. I may put a piece of tape over the sharp part and move on.This jacket is a pleasant surprise for only $45 US dollars. I purchased the Black heavy! I'm 5'10.5"" weight is 175lbs the large fits great. If anything the sleeves might be a smidgen small but not enough to be overly concerned. The faux leather looks pretty real. No smell like others mentioned. Seems warm enough and the removable hood rocks. Zippers are heavy duty and a bunch of pockets.  Would definitely recommend. Hope it lasts."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Beautiful jacket packed in most horrible way possible,3,"Lovely jacket, fits perfectly well. It looks great too. However, I'm disappointed on the packaging. This jacket arrived inside a see through plastic bag, crumbled like unused paper. There are wrinkles all along the shoulder, back and arms. I literally had to stretch it to make it wearable again.I'll keep using it and will update this section with my findings. That being said, I'm really disappointed with the way this jacket is packed."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"This product is price over quality, but serves its purpose",3,"I've owned this jacket well over a year now.Pros: For the price, this is a very warm jacket and looks great.Cons: Zippers are very sharp and will possibly cut into most things it comes into contact with (i.e., seat belt or leather seats. If the side pockets are open, the sleeves will tear itself on the zipper. Even if zippers are not open, they are still somewhat sharp. If I'm mindful of this it is less of an issue, but still annoying.Side note: not a bad jacket for the price, but I had to condition the leather to be more satisfied. Spend a little more for a jacket if you're looking for quality."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,“Leather” peels and sheds after a while,3,"UPDATE:After 2 years, the “leather” started peeling and shedding off around the places that bend, like the elbows and shoulders. Now in 2020 it’s unwearable. It’s a shame because my husband really liked it.ORIGINAL:Very nice jacket for the price. It was a gift for my 5'10”, 215lb husband and the 2XL fit great. He normally wears an XL but this runs slim. It's not too heavy or too lightweight but just about right for the mild winters we get in the south. I like that the hoodie unzips from the jacket and all the pockets! Husband can't wait for the weather to be cold enough to wear it."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Excellent coat to buy online,5,"I've never considered buying clothes on Amazon until recently and decided to buy this jacket and being that I recently lost a considerable amount of weight this year I took a chance on buying a size Large.  Other comments did say that it was a slim fit so I was a little worried until it arrived and I tried it on and I was extremely pleased how warm and comfortable it really is and for a decent price, too."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,He got a large and he has very broad shoulders and chest area and it fits nicely!,5,"Fits him well and isn't too heavy. very sleek and modern the arms are kind of long though. He got large and he has very broad shoulders and chest area and it fits nicely! He says its very comfy and the hood comes off so you can wash itGot this jacket in 2017 and it has held up very nicely, no rips or tears in it or shrinking of any sort, it cleans easily, my boyfriend wears it almost every single day and still looks amazing on him, I highly recommend this jacket for someone who wants high quality and not an outrageous price, my boyfriend wears it while he is working all the time and we are in the flooring business and he throws it wherever he can incase he gets hot."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Waited for it to go on sale, and wasn't disappointed.",5,"I wouldn't pay 60$+ but it went on sale around 30$ and jumped on the deal. This (Medium) jacket is pretty much everything I wanted in terms of the looks, however is it slightly bulky for me (Male, 5'6, 140lbs) which is appreciated even though overheating can be a more common issue. It same its a moderately strong smell that sometimes comes with being newly manufactured  jackets/jeans. Wasn't too pleasurable but wasn't revolting either, it settled down 25%+ after wash #1, no peeling or fraying as of yet, 2 weeks in."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Perfect casual jacket IMO!,5,"I bought this jacket a couple of years ago and it has since become my favorite jacket I have ever owned. I originally got the heavy version, which was far too heavy for southeast USA. I exchanged for the lighter version and it is the perfect jacket for casual wear in temps ranging from low 60s to 20s. It looks great, is super comfortable with or without the hood, and is super durable as if it were real leather. It’s the perfect casual jacket, in my opinion."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Great jacket overall just watch out for the buttons,4,Waited a couple of weeks to get this review out.I got this coat a size up because per the sizing guide (im usually a large but got an XL) got the heavy variety because it was gonna be my winter coat. And i must say the jacjet is very exceptional quality for the price. Although in a few weeks in 2 buttons in the hood fell off but i kinda expected that. The zippers still feel good after a few weeks of zipoing and unzipping and the jacket in general still holds up even after a few weeks of fairly constant abraision from sitting on a bus and from usual high school things. Overall if youre into leather jackets and dont kind faux (fake) leather i highly reccomend it just take some tlc with the buttons on the hood.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,I do not own a motorcycle,5,"I waited to write this review until I had worn the jacket for two months. It’s very comfortable, the zippers don’t appear to break easily, and it looks good as a jacket overall. Although I’m sure it’s not made for it, I’ve worn it in harsh winds and temperatures below zero and was pleasantly surprised with how warm I stayed. It’s clearly not the ideal winter coat, but if you’re in search of a good looking, comfortable cold weather jacket, this could be it. The biggest negative in my opinion is that it’s not machine washable, though I don’t think any faux or real leather item is. The detachable hood is however, and it’s something I didn’t expect to use but found myself liking a lot."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Love this jacket,5,"I bought the jacket for my son. Great QUALITY, and I love how this looks on my son. My son is big and tall, he is 6 feet 3 inches, and 275 pounds it’s very hard for me to find jackets that fit him. Some are too short in the sleeves and length. This jacket was PERFECT. Thank you"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Great jacket, but minor issues",4,"It's heavy and good quality, perfect for winter! However, I did have a couple small issues that kept it from being 5 stars. First is that the sleeves are way too long; I can pull my hands inside and still have a few inches to the ends, making it look a bit baggy. The other issue is more of a nitpick, but I ordered the ultra thick black one thinking it would have the light gray hood pictured, but it came with the dark gray shown on the medium thick. Minor, but still slightly disappointing.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend it."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Great quality jacket that fits well.,5,"My husband is a small framed man weighing 130lbs standing 5’8. Sometimes his clothes don’t really compliment his body structure. But this jacket looks absolutely great on him. He’s normally a size small, but I grabbed him a medium to fit hoodies underneath. It worked perfectly. Great quality, great look. He loves it and I love it on him ❤️💕"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"New Favorite, but...",4,"This was a Christmas present for my 17yr old son. He loved it so much, he replaced his normal winter coat with this when we did some errands. Unfortunately one of the zipper pulls broke off within a couple days of wearing it. We immediately started the exchange process - he didn't want to return it, just exchange it, assuming there was just a fluke in the zipper. To our complete surprise, we received the new coat before I could even repackage the returning coat and get it out in the mail. My son immediately started wearing it again and has had no issues with it so far. It's comfortable, fits his long arms, is super warm and flexible, which is one thing we were concerned about because of the material. Sometimes it can be very stiff, and he wanted something easy to sit in. It's been perfect so far!"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Perfect jacket,5,"I love this jacket, bought when I was trying to bike to work.As with other jackets with liners, the arms would stick when sweating, so I don't recommend doing it without long sleeves.That said, it is very warm, but not too warm to be warn inside.I get a lot of compliments on it, and it feels really nice. Stitching looks good and everything lines up well and is symmetrical.Looks great with and without the hood. Love all the pockets too. Saw a similar looking jacket in the store for like $200.Would highly recommend."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Not the best pic,5,It looks and fits as expected. I was looking for something sort of semi cozy and will keep my warm and this does the job. It is not but it is not heavy in a bad way. It has this new york street sort of style. Pretty good deal for the price too. Decent material and doesn't feel cheap. I was worried it may not fit me arm wise because I'm 6ft and have long arms. But it fits perfect. Ive had guys giving me compliments in public. the only thing I noticed was that one of the side pockets seemed not to match the other. One seemed smaller...as if it is sewed incorrectly  but it doesnt bother me much.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Best winter jacket I've ever had,5,"This jacket is warm and very comfortable. I've got an iron deficiency, so it's hard for me to stay warm, but this jacket keeps me very warm and comfortable when im cold. I'd definitely recommend this jacket- the only con, albeit very small, is that it's a bit heavy, but it makes up for that very well with it's durability and comfort."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Incredible Value - Well Made Apparel,5,"I don't do reviews often - but this coat is amazing. It's quite heavy and suitable for Chicago winter weather, and it looks fantastic. I'm a bit particular about my appearance, and I feel really sharp while wearing this jacket. I will definitely be looking for other products made by the brand - it's REALLY well made. Highly suggest you get it if you're looking for a leather coat. For real, it's awesome."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,The only real issue was one of zippers for the hood is messed up but that should be an easy fix. It's warmer then expected so I,4,"Little small but I have a little bigger build and I'm tall so I should have expected it. The only real issue was one of zippers for the hood is messed up but that should be an easy fix. It's warmer then expected so I like that. Little much for the hot summers but it works great when it's a little chilly and will be perfect for the fall. I love the detachable hood, it comes in handy a lot. Only thing is the buttons holding it are a little small but it will probably hold better when the zipper is fixed. It really looks great and I get a lot of complements on it. For the money, I think it's definitely worth it. The inside pocket is huge and I love it. I like having a lot of pockets so with 5 pockets this works great. Overall, I love this jacket even with the little miner issues."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,True to size,4,"I was concerned about ordering the right size because other reviews said this jacket ran small. We ordered a size large, the size my son always wears and it fit exactly like a large.  I think the sizing is right on the mark.  He loves the jacket.  And loves that the hood is removable.  It’s brand new now, hope it lasts a couple seasons!  Zipper is a little sticky. We used bar soap to lube it and seems to have done the trick. If your zipper is sticky, don’t force it. There are easy ways to get the glide smooth."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Why shirt buttons?,3,"It's a good jacket, blocks the wind as I ride the boats where I work, my only dislike is the hood, why is the hood held in place with shirt buttons? The jacket features a removable hood that also takes out this thin extension to the jacket. I dont remove the hood simply because the zipper broke and I cant zip it up. The hood's attached mainly by zippers via the extension but instead of one zipper all the way through its 2 zippers along the chest of the jacket and then around the back of the neck there are 3 tiny shirt buttons to hold the hood on, and they dont hold the hood on very well."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Great jacket, fits perfect.",4,"XL, light weight version, it feels like a heavier version of a bomber jacket for a close comparison, thicker cuffs, nice lining. I gave it 4 stars for a lot of loose strings I needed to trimmed, stitching looks good otherwise. Tons of tags to cut out too. Pretty good sized hood, larger than most sweatshirts.I will update after the winter.FYI Care instructions are machine wash cold regular, wring out, hang dry in shade or regular dry clean. Do not stream, no bleach, no tumble dry."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Fits as expected.,5,"Bought one for my boyfriend, not too heavy and fits as was expected. He LOVES that the hood is detachable and that all the pockets have zippers. He says it's not too big, not too small, not too loose and not too tight. He said the only little hick-up he had with it was figuring out how to attach the hoodie to the jacket, but it wasn't that difficult to figure out after two minutes of fiddling with the zippers.I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this for anyone looking for a stylish and warm jacket. It's very trendy and badass. 👌🏻💯"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Good quality. Looks good. Fits well.,5,The jacket looks good and fits well. It is also thick and will work well in the winter. The hood also look well and is nice for rainy days. The size chart is correct.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Good price and style,5,"Honestly for the price I wasn't expecting to much. However, this is now my favorite jacket I have. I ride motorcycles both sport as well as cruiser and this jacket has enough play that I can comfortably move the handle bars and still feel comfortable as well as in my opinion look decent."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Great Jacket - Horrible Quality,2,"Bought this jacket as the end of Sept 2018. Looks great, fits great. But all of the internal seems on the inside of the jacket are pulling apart. I have no way of contacting the company, but for a jacket lasting only 5 months is ridiculous. I am a little upset that no one has reached out to me and that this jacket is already going to be thrown away."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Good jacket - no beef involved,4,"Does run a bit small as others have mentioned. Buy a size larger than you think you need. Looks good, wears as a good medium cold jacket. Removable hood is a nice touch. It has a metal zipper, but I would call it a medium weight zipper. Not as heavy as common jeans zipper. Zipper is left handed. Surprised at that since it was not mentioned, but I can adapt. Overall, I like it. Put some gloves with it and good into low 30's."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,I love this jacket 😍,5,This jacket is pretty awesome. It is totally what I was looking for. My hubby surprised me with it as an early Christmas gift. I couldn't find a women's jacket that I like. When I saw this one I fell in love. It is everything I hoped it would be and more. Its nice and warm too.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Great fit, good quality",5,"I don't normally write reviews on products. However, after just receiving this jacket I had to share. I've never bought clothes online, so I was a little nervous finding something that would fit. I was pleasantly surprised that this was a perfect fit. I highly recommend following the size chart guide and take your measurements. I normally wear a medium, but decided to measure myself and ordered a large instead, and it was a perfect fit. Material quality is great. My last winter coat was the same thickness (slightly on the thin side) but did perfect during mid-west winters. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a great coat!"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Better than expected,5,"I was alittle skeptical about this considering some of the reviews. I bought for my brother's birthday, he is 6'2 and about 250lbs and built like a brick house. I had to return the size I originally bought because some of the reviews said it ran small. I ended up just going with his original size of XL and he absolutely loves it. He couldn't be anymore happy with the fit, the material, and the style. It wasn't too bag nor was it too long. It gave him enough room that he could still wear a long sleeve without it being too tight."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Great deal, looks great!",5,This jacket was on sale when I was looking for a new one for the bars. It completely exceeded my expectations!It looks great and kept me warm (in the winter) between bars! The only thing that I wish that it had was maybe an extra replacement good.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Not so good in person,3,I own several Wantdo coats. I love them. This one however disappointed. The coat is an unattractive shiny pleather with lots of pockets that look weird in person. It's not very thick or padded. The flimsy construction means it will get torn up easily.What a shame..
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,FREAKING LOVE This jacket!,5,"I FREAKING love this jacket! Came as described, FAST shipping. Gawd, I wish I could articulate myself on how much I love this jacket. I purchased the dark brown/black light weight jacket. It's medium heavy, very durable and keep a you very warm but not overheated. I got soooo many compliments on it. Next week I will be ordering the Tan/light brown one! If you're thinking about purchasing one of these jackets,  do it!!! You won't be disappointed! I even had my model headshots taken with this jacket on!"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Loved the jacket but didn't last,2,"I got this in mid-January so wore it about a month and a half then and then just a few weeks this winter and already is falling apart. I loved the fit and comfort. Loved the pockets. But for a faux jacket it's just too expensive not to last an entire season. If it were half the price, I would probably buy one every year and throw it away."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Fantastic Jacket to look good in,5,"If you're anything like me I would save up to buy this jacket, been eyeballing until the price was right below $50. Decent quality lots of pockets in convenient places. Even the heavy jacket isn't terrible but I love the interchangable hoodie that comes along. The size is true to American standard at least the 1x I bought myself."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,4 stars due to buttons lack of secureness,4,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my SO. So far he is pleased with the quality of material. However, it is too big for him, but he still likes it. I believe the sizing chart to be true to size, as I ordered 2 sizes larger, because I was scared it ran small.The only con about this jacket is the hood is poorly secured by buttons in the center and a zipper on each end. My SO has broken 2 buttons since purchasing."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,He likes it!!,4,"I got this for my bf, who is 6'4 and like 170#. He is a super slim dood, with a longer torso. The large fits his shoulders, and doesn't look too bulky on him. I wish it was a bit longer in the torso but does fit like a normal leather jacket and goes to the bottom of his belt. It looks good, packaging was easy to get in to. Happy with the purchase so far! He says it keeps him at a nice temperature. No odd smell or anything when we opened it."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Will buy again,5,"My son wears size Medium in shirts and sweaters, I got this one size large and fit him just right..Mind you, he likes his close tight but he loved this jacket. I got him the heavy one."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Couldn't be happier! Bought the light weight one as we live ...,5,Bought this jacket for my very thin son who is 6' tall and only 125 lbs. bought him a small and went according to the measurement chart. He loves it!!! Fits perfectly! I was worried with him being so tall and thin but it's not to short and the sleeves aren't either! Couldn't be happier!Bought the light weight one as we live in Southern California
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Not exactly what is advertised,3,Pros the jacked fits and it looks cool. But there are a few things that arent so good First off the hoody laces are super short. Nothing like the picture. Pretty much just a little knot. This sucks because i really like the way they look like in the picture. Long fat laces but no its only like an inch long. Second is the zipper handles feel cheap. They get stuck easy and not on the fabric. They dont seem to run along the zippper smoothly. The jacket is 100% polyester fyi.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Bought it for my trip up North,5,"Ended up picking this out for a trip to see my girlfriend, was my first time meeting her and experiencing Northern cold weather. This jacket helped out a lot, made me feel like I had the drip just wearing it and it was cozy."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,warm and looks good,4,"I bought this for my son, who is in high school. It's cool enough for him!  And warm enough too. He's really happy with it, and has worn it every day since it arrived. I imagine if you were looking for real leather, this isn't the right jacket for you, but it works for us because it's water repellent and warm, and has a hood."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Loved It, Wish it lasted longer though",3,"Pros: It kept me warm in midwestern falls, springs and early winters, though I recommend a sweatshirt underneath for the dead of winter, and it fit pretty well, and the ribbed cuffs and bottom hem didn't stretch out with repeated use,Cons: Almost immediately the faux leather started flaking, and about a year and a half after purchase the zipper stopped working for no apparent reason. It goes up but the teeth don't bind together for no apparent reason.Overall, I would not buy this jacket again, I had a similar jacket made by Converse and it lasted for 4 years, and it went through a lot more abuse than this one, like I'm talking 4 years of morning drumline practice.  When I was forced to replace it with this jacket it was not because of the zipper. For a jacket that is 3 times the price of my old one I would have expected it to last at least as long as the old one."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Surprisingly Good Product,5,"Wow! Very pleasantly surprised. I have bought a lot of different cheap, Chinese made jackets off Amazon, and I always return them, because they are usually terrible quality. Got this for $40 and it is warm, comfy, and looks good. The zipper that connects the removable hood to the jacket is very cheap, and it actually has 3 buttons, instead of a zipper, where the hood meets the jacket. Overall, however, considering the price, I cant give this less than 5 stars. Much better than expected."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Awesome,5,I'm a lady so I ordered a small and I ordered the thicker version because I get cold very easily. This jacket is well made and I will be using it for work this winter because I work outside. I anticipate it will work well.The shoulders on me are wide but it is a men's jacket so I will not count that against my review I'm just hoping at some point they will relax but if not it's no big deal to me.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"I’m roughly 6 ft tall and weigh 240 and the xxl fits good, I only gave it 4 stars because I ...",4,"The jacket does run small, I’m roughly 6 ft tall and weigh 240 and the xxl fits good, I only gave it 4 stars because I couldn’t find any info on the difference between heavy and light and someone stated it was the color darkness of the black, I ordered the heavy which is thicker but I would rather of had the lighter jacket. Other than that it’s great, good quality so far"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Very nice quality, husband loves it",5,"Very nice quality, husband loves it. It hits all of his requirements (which is very hard to do, the picky bastard). The removable hood makes cleaning easy. So far, no creases and wrinkling. It is pretty warm for him, but if you get cold easily you might want to wear a sweater underneath. Looks very stylish. My husband is a medium and the size medium coat fit true to size. 10/10 would buy again."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Good enough,3,"Not too small to the point I need to send it back, but next time I order one I'll make sure to get a xxxl. My old leather coat is xxl. That's y I went xxl with this one. Kinda tight in chest/upper arms and it's just a little shorter than I like. Sleeve length is good n everything"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Surprisingly High Quality,5,"I never expect Amazon clothes to look this good. I bought this for my boyfriend and when he opened up the package we were impressed at how nice the leather was, thick the material is, and the amount of quality that is in the jacket. It keeps him pretty warm and blocks out the chilly winds we've been getting this winter. I also like the fact that the hoody portion can be removed to change the style. It's my boyfriend's favorite jacket now."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Good product for a great price,1,"I purchased this for cold rides on the motorcycle. I still wear underlining gear beneath the jacket, BUT,  the jacket does 95% of the work. Without the undergear it still keeps me decently warm when the outside temp is around 50°. Its nice and heavy, fits nice and feels good."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,PERFECTION!,5,"No defects on arrival and it arrived quickly.

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Good Looking Jacket, but read update",3,"My son hasn't tried it on yet, but this is a good looking jacket.  Stitching is good, zipper is fine.  Its way cool that the hoodie comes out.Update: one of the buttons came off within minutes of him putting it on, we had to sew another one on, which was fine, but 5 weeks into wearing this the stitching under the arm inside of the jacket has come apart.  I could understand that if he was rough with this jacket but he isn’t."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Keeps You Extremely Warm.,5,"Attended a convention in Milwaukee. It was snowy and windy and I didnt expect it to be that cold (As I come from the more southern part of the country). And got this more for fashion than actual usefulness. This was the only real coat I had and was worried about being absolutely freezing outside. Nope. I was warm as can be. With just regular pants and this coat. I was actually sweating from how warm it was. And it was around 28F outside, had to crack the zipper open slightly to let some cold air in to regulate myself!.  If you want a coat that will keep you warm. And look good while doing it. I highly recommend this."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Great jacket but one issue,4,This is a gray jacket it is very warm and very stylish however I only have one issue with it and that is the smell. This jacket has a certain smell to it that has not gone away since I bought it almost 3 months ago I hope it will go away over time but that is my only issue.

I was worried because I got the thick one. It’s not that thick, I was expecting like super thick. It’s great, it has weight to it. My husband loves it too, really nice that the hoodie parts can come off. Where we live it rains often (doesn’t snow), the jacket does a good job at keeping him majority dry! It’s very handsome on him"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Good jacket. Added hood could be better.,3,I think that the jacket fits okay on me but the added hood that zips inside the jacket is shorter in length that the jacket itself. It is a little above my and when visable it looks like I'm wearing a child's hoodie underneath. The actual jacketni have no complaints. It is actually very warm and worked great in our last snow storm.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,I love it,5,"This jacket is going to be my favorite jacket for awhile, it fit me perfectly as expected. I got US Medium which i normally wear in jacket sizes and it fit absolutely perfectly. Lots of reviews here say to go up a size from your normal size but i didnt and im glad i didnt. Quality is nice, the removable hood is awesome, and its very comfortable to wear."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Very good looking jacket,5,Love this jacket. It looks great. For size info I am 6'1 200 lbs. My normal jacket size (suit or sports coat) is 46 long. Large fits great.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Favorite Jacket,5,"Definately my favorite jacket. I got the light version of the black leather and it keeps me nice and warm in 40 degree weather. Anything lower, i would go with the heavy version."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Broke right away,2,"First let me say this jacket isn't all bad.  Very comfortable and stylish, and you can stay pretty flexible in it if you have the right size.  The thing I didn't like was the zippers for the hood broke right away, also because of the zipper broken scratches the back of neck.  I got the zipper to go on for a bit but with would not lock the teeth properly so it would come right back undone.  All the zippers feel kinda cheap not sure if I got a bad one or what.  Going to see about returning it."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Comfortable and heavy.,5,"This will keep you warm and cozy. It fit me really well, and the sleeves are not too long and not too short. It's well made and worth the price and wait. The ability to remove the hoodie is a nice feature as well."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,I Like It,4,I would have given this product 5 stars but the button to the detachable hoodie broke off the very first time I took the hoodie off. I got the Heavy version and it definitely works in the cold Carolina Fall season. Nice classy leather LooK. My only suggestion is make the detachable hoodie The Same Length** as the jacket. My hoodie zipper is about 4 inches from the bottom of the jacket.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,sleeve length too long,2,The only thing I didn’t like about this jacket of his was the arms were so long I had to bring it to a seamstress and shorten up the sleeve length so I spent more money than I anticipated on his jacket. Fits great now and looks great in him!!
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Fits as expected,2,"Jacket fits exactly as expected. A bit heavier than expected though. Looks and feels great.**Update**Not even a full month after receiving the jacket and only wearing it during rainy or chilly days, jacket sleeves showing wear and have torn from rubbing the pocket zippers."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Great jacket, size down for tall slim folks.",5,"I’m 6’6” 220lbs and initially ordered an XL. Felt like I was swimming the the jacket, sleeves were super bulky and it was almost like I could fit two of me in the body of it. Returned and ordered a large instead and it fits just about perfectly. Torso is a little short but would probably be fine for somebody with normal proportions. Most importantly the fit is much slimmer at larger and actually has a nice tailored look. The heaviness of the jacket will be perfect for the winter as well. Very happy with this for the price point for sure."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Great,5,"To help anyone else out, i'm 5'7 and wear small in shirt size, i wear medium hoodies and the medium here fits very well. Im 5'7 130lbs  for anyone else near that it should fit as long as you are built around average range, otherwise its great, wore in -3 degrees and only felt the cold on my hands and face as they werent covered"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,It does run small......I'd say go up a normal size.....2 sizes if you want a bit of room,4,Lots of reviews on sizing issues. It does seem to run smaller than your average men's sizes.....I bought this for my son as a present. I purchased a large.....he normally wears a medium men's tshirt. His waist is a 29 or 30 and his inseam is 32in. He's very slim and nearly 6ft tall with a long armspan.  The large is a perfect fit. For the price it is very well made really has a real leather look and feel.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Nice coat,4,"I bought this for my son, and he LOVES it. It seems to run a little bit small, but it still fit. The only 2 negatives I can say about this is 1) it ripped after 5 months, but I tend to think its my son's fault, and not the manufacturing. He destroys EVERYTHING...LOL and 2) It smells unpleasant when it gets wet, which doesn't seem to totally go away when it is dry again."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Tight waist,5,Love it I need to lose a few pounds before it fits perfect but another goal is fine by me I can zip it alright just a tighter fit at the bottom than the top
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Lower quality, lower price.",2,"Sized a little too small. Quality was not great, so returned item. Return process was quick and easy - so returns review is 5-star, product review (which I no longer have) is 2-star or less. Not super pricey, so not surprised about quality."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Zero customer service.,1,"Ordered this jacket in medium on a sale price. Ended up being a bit too big so I tried to arrange exchanging it for a small. Was told that it could not be done. Somehow you cannot evenly exchange an item for a different size and have them still honor the price. Would have to buy it again at the now $30 more price. Horrible customer service that makes absolutely no sense. Jacket is nice, but beware if you have any issues with it. You will get no help."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Definitely looks good in anyone,5,"This is my first ever faux leather jacket and im absolutely in love with the fit, the style and most importantly the warm and confort.

I should of bought a medium but I got a large. I’m a 5”6 165lbs female. It’s a little long on the arms. It is a men’s jacket so I understand why. Heavy jacket and Nice material.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Great buy!,5,I’m 5’7 145lbs and got a Medium. This jacket fits slightly larger than I would like but other than that it fits perfect. It is definitely a silky type liner not a quilted liner like one review states. Definitely worth the price.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Great coat!,5,"This product is high quality. It doesn't feel flimsy or cheap. It's colors and appearance are just as they are in the photo. The jacket is technically a jacket and not a coat- but, it is nice and warm! Very handsome and attractive product. Would recommend to anyone looking for something stylish but functional."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Decent purchase not thrilled with its quality,2,Ordered for a friend & the coat was very flattering but the leather fades quickly!After only having it a week or so it was very noticeable on the sleeve that the leather was chipping away.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Looks good, keeps you warm.",4,"My grandson got this jacket and loves it.

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Subpar stitching and threads used in manufacturing No QC done !,1,"This Jacket has a good look and feel and as expected however the problem lies in its quality.As they say ~ The proof of the pudding lies in eating it!I purchased this in September end and started using it lightly in November, as i understand that this is more of a fashion Jacket and not meant to stop freezing cold in a place where the temperature often hits -18C, By December end this became unusable since the stitching came off from it's sides.Understandably the manufacturer has used a sub par thread to attach two man made material which cannot hold the stress of zipping and unzipping ! Bravo! I'm very much impressed by the out of box thinking"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"A warm, stylish coat",4,"The zippers are challenging when putting hood in place.

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Nice, warm jacket for under 50 bucks!",5,"Really cannot beat this price for this product. The inside is lined and the jacket is very warm!! I'm 6' and 175lbs, my shirt size is 40-42 so I got this in ""L"" but the sleeves were a wee bit longer and the fit slightly looser than I expected. Overall, I like it for the price and the fact that the hood/lining is removable is awesome! The zipper teeth are kinda sharp, but I don't want to get picky about a jacket which is <$50."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Zipper broke easily,2,My younger teenage son wore this for a couple of weeks just to school and back and the zipper broke within a couple of weeks. The cost to replace the zipper isn't worth the jacket. Save your money for a better quality.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Doesn't do well over time. Also a little too long in the sleeve length.,2,After 3 years of very short usage the faux leather is falling apart. The jacket itself is in good shape but I can't wear it since it looks awful. I don't think it's worth the price.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Very warm but a little short.,4,"This is a super warm coat.  I bought the heavy version and it is quite heavy, both in thickness and weight.  I wanted it as a replacement for a zip-up hoodie I always wear in the fall and winter.  This might be too think to wear in the fall, but it will be nice in the winter.  My only real issue with the coat is that is is really short on the body.  The arms are extra long, which is nice, but the bottom of the coat barely reaches the top of my pants.  I wish it were a few inches longer."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Breakfast club 7 member the P-Man!,5,Cause it gets cold outside and I need some warmth. As a kid growing up in the 70’s and 80’s. I loved it when Jason Patric wore these types of jackets. I also like Boggy who wore the same jackets in the breakfast club. Boggy he was such a funny kid but he looked cool in his jacket just like this!!
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,5 Star Jacket,5,"For US sizes, get one size larger than your normal shirt size. The detachable hood is a nice touch, you can go from urban to suburban really easily. The leather is delicate, so I wouldn’t recommend rolling around with it or doing activities that can snag or tear the leather. It’s got a great sleek look that goes well for a casual night out in the city. The pockets are nice and the jacket can overall keep you warm.It’s a great buy. My biggest concern is that too many people will get it and I won’t be the only guy in my neighborhood with a cool leather jacket."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Nice coat,5,Nice warm jacket. Quality seems pretty good and my husband loves wearing it.

He was disappointed when the interior zipper was found to be defective. 3 stars for the defective zipper, but overall good fit. Also-- we still haven't figured out what the ""heavy"" vs ""light"" black difference is.."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Finally!,4,Do you know how hard it is to find a coat for someone over 6 feet who knows what the inside of a gym looks like? Especially one that isn't a parka or isn't a bland Michelin Man puffy POS?It fits great and looks great. Could do with a bit more insulation but would work fine with a long sleeve shirt.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,It's perfectly fine. Not extraordinary,4,"This was a birthday gift for my boyfriend. 6ft4It looks nice, but the fit is a little strange.It's warm, soft on the inside.Boyfriend complained that the pockets were super shallow, and the sleeve length is a little strange compared to the jacket length itself.The jacket looks masculine but fits feminine.. Short and loose.  Not exactly what I was going for but it works."

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Fits just right,5,I’m 6’3 and 135lbs. I got the large when I heard it fits tight. I was more concerned with the sleeves not covering my arms. Large turns out to be the right fit. It’s not very loose either. Of course I can always gain more weight to fill in the tiny gaps. It looks nice and feels nice. I live Arizona so I won’t get too many chances to wear but I’ve always wanted one
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Poor workmanship.,1,"I loved the way this jacket looked and fitted.  Found it comfortable as well as usefully thought out for storage.Problem poorly constructed, only got to use this jacket a couple of times and had it come apart at the seams ""Completely apart"". If you are a seamstress buy it...  Otherwise, I wouldn't purchase this item."

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Awesome jacket! Very warm!,5,"I actually ordered this 2 times. The first time was a large (heavy) for my fiancé who’s 6’2” around 180 lb and it was too big for him, looked like he was swimming it. I returned it and got a medium (heavy) which fits amazingly. :) he loves it."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Fits good and metal zippers are nice.,5,I'm 6'2'' an 240 so I ordered a 2X and it fits perfect.

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Love it!!!,5,"My son absolutely loves his jacket.  We got him a size large,,, he's 6'2"",, 150lbs.  The inside zipper on the grey part does not zip very well but he just uses the outside zipper anyway. He gets allot of compliments on it, very stylish!!"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Fits nice, but there's one issue.",2,"The jacket fits well and is very warm, but the three buttons that hold the hood on are horribly attached. Two of the three buttons have fallen off already, and I haven't even worn it for more than a few hours. Other than that it seems well made, but that one major flaw brings it down to 2 stars. If I had paid $20 or less I wouldn't have had much to complain about, but for $50 bucks I expect my jacket to at least stay together."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Good coat...great quality,5,"Nice coat, well put together and my teenage son loves it. He wears it almost everyday."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Good jacket with a modern look,4,The inside pocket had a hole in it and there were quarters jingling at the bottom. It was nice but the person that sent it I guess didn't check it.

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Defective, low quality",2,"The jacket seems to be low quality and based on the reviews I got xxl instead of xl but it was a little too big (I'm 6'2"" 227 lbs) But my MAIN ISSUE is that the inside of the right sleeve seems to be sewn wrong it was all twisted I couldn't get my hand through it and when I did manage to get my hand through it by untwisting it the sleeve looked twisted on the outside and felt weird."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Fits perfectly without having to order a size up, beautiful and well-made jacket.",5,"I was worried that the sizing wouldn't be accurate, but I decided to go ahead and order the ""Heavy"" Medium rather than a Large because I wear a US Medium. The jacket fits perfectly, as if it had been made for me. I am 5'11ish, 140 pounds. If you're taller, or you're bulked up then you might want to get the large. This jacket is my new fav!! :)"

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,I love the way this jacket looks on me and it ...,4,I love the way this jacket looks on me and it is really warm.  People compliment it a lot.  Great to wear if you are going on a first date.The only thing that makes me give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the buttons on the hoodie.  One time I unbuttoned the hoodie and now I can never get several of the buttons to stay buttoned.  It looks weird this way and people have noticed.  I need to get some superglue or something.And I'm actually wearing it as I type this.  Wasn't planning on that.

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Bad Hood Zippers,3,I love the jacket but I took off the hood and I can't zipper it back on. Zippers on hood are different sizes on each side. Those zippers are plastic and cannot be used once removed.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Pocket zipper failure,5,I ride a motorcycle and on a very windy day my phone had blown out of my jacket pocket. My jacket pocket was zipped closed also. So just a suggestion reverse the direction of the zipper. Zip it downward to close it zip it upward to open.

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Great for price, true to size",5,"Love this jacket. But i bought a Medium since i’m actually a small you know because wanted some room for layers. Unfortunately there’s no space for layers it fits just right (not tight, not loose enough to add some layers) so in the end, my bad. Great deal. Hope this lasts. Fits true to size so if you want to wear this with some layers underneath, go sizes up."

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Great jacket but I ordered it a size bigger as ...,4,Great jacket but I ordered it a size bigger as advised on the ratings and it fit too big. I will have to return it and get a smaller size. My brother is a regular large as he is built and works out each day. He did love the style so I will need to return for one smaller size. My advise is that if you are a large with no belly order your size.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,"Very warm jacket, a couple minor problems",4,"This was a really nice, warm jacket. I got the black (heavy) and it defiantly kept me warm. You can take off the hood via buttons and zippers, and it’s very easy to get the good back on. I’m 5’5 and thin, and I ordered the small, which still fit a bit baggy on me. The hood area is very thick, so I usually wear the jacket without the hood now that I have a different hooded leather jacket. The collar gets a bit irritating, but otherwise it’s very warm and nice"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Really confortable for a cold weather,5,"This jacket it is worth it, it is a good material and it really help you keep warm when is cold."
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Are we sure this is for men???,1,"Ordered for my husband overseas. Checked the size charts and ordered him a medium, which is pretty standard with all the rest of his clothing. He explain to me that it was a bit small. When he brought it home and tried it on for me, I couldn't believe it. It was TINY, and also did not hold up to the shape in the picture at all. I usually wear a women's medium/large, and the coat fit on me. Severely disappointed."

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Good stuff,4,"Love the quality, color, and fit but it was a little thicker than I imagined. It’ll keep you very warm though! Only thing I don’t like is the zippers on the pockets. They scratch my hands so bad when I put my hands in them. Hurts pretty bad when it’s cold."

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Rugged and masculine,5,This is a good fit. It looks way better imo w/o the hood. I’d buy it again. I wore it out and a woman asked if I rode a motorcycle. So it’s got that kind of look. Pretty rugged and masculine. It doesn’t smell the best but a spritz if cologne is enough to change that.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Very sharp looking jacket happy with purchase,5,I purchased this as a gift for a family member.He loves it and fits well and he gets compliments all the time on it.
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Too loose in the sleeves,2,"The color and style was as expected, but the size of the sleeves was too big. They weren’t too long, but too loose in the arms if that makes sense, so there was a lot of extra material bunching up. I ordered the small and medium for my husband and both had the same oversized sleeve problem. We’re returning for that reason, but otherwise it’s a nice jacket"
Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Comfort and stylish,4,The jacket is nice and stylish. Road it in 35degrees and felt only a small chill. There was a small hole in the inside breast pocket though. That's my reason for giving it 4 stars.

Wantdo Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood Motorcycle Jacket Casual Vintage Warm Winter Coat,Quality materials,5,Pretty quality! Not as thick as I was expecting.

adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Just as described,5,Great product has adidas tags and suggested 50$ tag.I'm ordering another one before they sell out .
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,More breathable than older 3-stripe tricot,5,"This tricot feels lighter and more breathable than the older tricot (with slanted 3-stripe adidas logo on the chest).  The fibers appear less ""mesh-like"" and more woven.  The older style was kind of ""shiny"" and felt heavier.  I love this though.  I'm wearing it in the low 80's in the strong South Carolina sun and it feels great.  I bought the white with black stripes.  It looks so good.adidas price tag attached said $50.This is the older tricot.https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Essentials-3-Stripe-Tricot-Jacket/dp/B01NAL8JSZ/ref=pd_sbs_200_1/144-1173390-4018808?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B01NAL8JSZ&pd_rd_r=a18fdd95-75ae-11e9-ad99-d763d3fc76f8&pd_rd_w=QMlBZ&pd_rd_wg=iOmI0&pf_rd_p=588939de-d3f8-42f1-a3d8-d556eae5797d&pf_rd_r=EVY9NB3T734ZCBK6PAY5&refRID=EVY9NB3T734ZCBK6PAY5"
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,"Purchased from Amazon Services LLC, looks and feels authentic...",4,"I recently purchased the black/black version of this track jacket. The seller was Amazon Services LLC. The jacket arrived in a clear plastic bag. The jacket feels and looks authentic. It didn't have any price or barcode tags, but it did have all the seemingly appropriate tags for an Adidas product -- brand and size tag on the bag of the neck, production lot, quality control, and laundry care instructions on the lower left-hand side. I would be 100% convinced of authenticity if it had the typical brand, style, and price tags on the neck tag, but everything else points to it being authentic. A great look, obviously, goes without saying, but authenticity is always a concern."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Nice Jacket,5,This is an authentic Adidas jacket contrary to what one reviewer posted. I already have two that I bought from Macy's. There is no difference between those two and the one I bought from here. I like these jackets alot.
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Not up to expectations,3,"Fits large. The sleeves are very big so if you're muscular this may be what you'd want. But I'm not jacked or anything, so it doesn't work for me. I don't really prefer the feel of the material. I have a Nike track jacket (large size) I bought for $80 and I love it. I was hoping this would be similar, but it just doesn't cut it for me.If you're a thinner person you may want to consider sizing down. I am 5'9"" and 185 lbs. My wingspan is 6' though and the sleeves just were long enough. So I suspect sizing down, in my case, would make them too short. I will be returning this."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,"Very light, comfortable fit",5,"I got the light grey with Black stripes. I own another one that is Royal blue purchased from poshmark. This one's a little thinner than the blue one. Keeps me warm enough but not the same as a hoodie. Good spring jacket or for running, which is why I bought it. Comfy fit, not too loose but neither right. Sleeve length just right."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,True to size,4,"I read so many reviews saying to go up a size that I bought X-Large instead of Large. It was too big :/ I should have bought my size, which is Large. It would have been a perfect fit. That said, its a beautiful product."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,I love this! Sleek and nice and sporty!,5,"I love the design and how I look with it.It's very trendy looking and help me look slimmer with the white Adidas stripes and black color.It's very comfortable.It is perfect to wear on any seasons, but I love it most on Spring and Fall kinda temperature.Much recommended A+++"
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Fits well. MADE IN JORDAN,4,The jacket I received has zipper pockets which is great to secure my things which is not shown in the photo. It seems to be well made and is heavier than I thought. I bought the large as I like my jackets roomy but my usual medium would have been fine.
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Great price for the items... great quality.,5,If you like your clothes to be on the more fitted style go a size down from what you would normally wear. I’m normally a size S but decided to take that chance & go with a XS and it fits great! I’m not a tall guy. I’m only 5’6 140 pound slim frame. But if you decide to go your normal size that will work too!
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,"Comfortable, but very nice outfit.",5,"I have long skinny legs and these pants enhance these long narrow legs. And the addidas jacket runs kind of snug on the arms. So you might want to order the jacket a size bigger. But the outfit looks nice on you, once you have it on."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,not for me. i need their xs ive been waiting for like a year now.  im happy,5,"i dont wear addidas, but this seems way too thin. so i like it. i will buy an xs but this one will be a home weari do love it and i feel naked without it. i will buy another one. im getting fat so idk if my xs dreams will come true."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Nice jacket,5,Nice jacket.  Not as loose as I wanted it to be...but I’ve got a belly.  Should be great if I can lose 10-15 pounds after Christmas.
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,"Quality product, great gift idea!!!",5,If you have ever had Adidas products you know about quality. It is worth every penny. A good light/medium weight jacket for any occasion. Too nice to wear as a workout jacket. 100% approval from me. Great gift for a spouse or significant other. 😁
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Knockoff,2,"Overall the quality feels satisfactory, but the negative review stems from the fact that upon wearing the sweater for the first time after delivery and without a wash, all of the Adidas letters from the front of the sweater popped off.  Absolutely no residue left behind which makes me believe this sweater was a cheap knockoff with stickers added to the front.  May need to knock of the last star depending on how it survives the washing machine for the first time."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Nice jacket,5,"What you expect from any adidas track jacket, just like the one from the store. It is true to size, i am 5’10 with a 45 inch chest and a large fits perfectly."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Amazing Savings,5,I had bought a generic Adidas outfit because I thought I couldn't afford the real deal. The price was half of what I normally see them sell for and the quality is just what you would expect. Mine arrived in the mail and I was so pleased I had to buy one for my husband. Definitely recommend.
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Great lightweight sports jacket,5,"This was the perfect jacket for my son to use for the tennis season. It’s light enough to be worn WHILE playing tennis, but still adds an extra layer of warmth during these windy/chilly evenings. It’s an athletic fit, not too baggy, which he liked. He is 6ft tall and 180lbs and the Medium/Tall fit perfectly! I love that it comes in tall bc the arms cover the wrists and the waist doesn’t ride up. Great sports jacket!!"
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,"Got it for $25, Best decision i ever made.",5,"i had always been a fan of Adidas just not a fan of their pricing, but i got this on sale for $25, and man this is totally worth $50, High end quality, very stylish, and matches their other clothing products, like their Joggers, Shoes, Etc, my only complaint is that the wind resistant, you can easily begin freezing in the cold."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Quality jacket,5,Thought it might be a fake due to a 20 dollar difference between the adidas website and amazon but it wasn’t! Saved some money and have a very comfortable and laid back jacket for school
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Wrong color...,2,"This jacket was everything except the right color. I ordered black. This is Navy. I had no time to return/exchange before my event so I had no choice. As long as you get the color you want, you should be fine."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Love it,5,It’s warm and stylish and comfortable! I ended up matching with my dad and that was weird cuz I obviously pulled it off better lol
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Colour doesn't match the image,2,"If you look at some of the black jackets, the image is black but on the colour description it says a different colour. Like on the one I bought, it showed black but whenever I received the jacket, it ended up being blue. They really need to fix the images as this misleads customers and causes wrong orders."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Nice Fitting Jacket!,5,"My son loves this jacket and he's very picky with his clothing, so this was a major win!  The color and quality are really nice and it looks and fits well. F.Y.I, My son is 5'8"", 105 lbs and the size I bought fit him perfectly. Highly recommend!"
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Adidas!!!  What more needs to be said!,5,I buy Adidas Essentials 3 Stripe Pants and Matching Jackets for my Brother in law. He loves them and he looks so cute in them!  I just hope they come out with new colors soon as he already has all the colors that look good on him.
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,"For the price, they are good",4,I love the polyester track jackets from Adidas.  Can’t beat the price and function.  These are very thin and good for moderately cool weather.Anything below $30 is fair.  $20 is a steal.
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Great purchase!,5,Got this for my husband for an anniversary gift. Looks smoking hot on him and he likes it a lot. The muted colors (dark grey and black stripes) make it easy to wear anywhere.

adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,perfect!,5,exactly what I wanted. I am 6'3'' 260 and I usually have to wear 3XL tops to be long enough for my torso but this 2XL tall size was perfect. keep in mind the style is a track jacket so it should not fit overly baggy. if you want baggy you may have to go a size up. would recommend to a friend.

adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Fit my small size teen,5,"My son is small for his 15 years so it can be difficult to find clothes for him. This was a Mens XS and I'm happy to say it fits him very well. It is roomy without being too big so he can grow into it. It looks great on him. He is 5'4"" and 110lbs and muscular."

First Mfg Co Men's Mandarin collar with center zipper,Very Nice,5,"Very nice classy jacket.Has spots for back, elbow and shoulder armour. I am using CE level 1 armour, Harley branded flat armour, fits great in the shoulder and elbows. The back I am using is from Rev'it.I am 5'10"" 240lbs, chest is 49, waist is 42. I got 2xl and it fits a little tight in the shoulder with the jacket liner and armour installed. Not enough to hinder movement or make the jacket uncomfortable. Otherwise the Jacket fits very well.The leather is super soft and feels great. It does a great job of blocking the wind. I use it for a short 20 minute commute, and the jacket w/liner is good alone down to 30F.I really like that it does not have a neck closure snap, those really annoy me. The sleeve openings are good and fit well. Just enough room for gloves to tuck under them, and if you wear gauntlet gloves they should fit over the sleeves.The inner pockets (both sides) are huge, will fit many items.this jacket has small airflow vents, seriously doubt these will do any good once it gets warm. I got this jacket for cold weather and it works great for it."
First Mfg Co Men's Mandarin collar with center zipper,Really Nice.  Fit to Ride,5,"I really like this jacket.  Heavy duty, great quality.  Reading other reviews, I feel the need to point out a couple things.  This jacket is meant to fit you while you are in riding position, not while you are standing.  So, while you are standing, the sleeves will be a bit long.  So, while you are riding with your arms up and grabbing the handle bars, it fits.The jacket has vented back slits and vented chest pockets.  It also has a zip out lining meant to keep you warm, along with zippers to tighten the sleeves around your forearm to keep wind out.  If you just unzip the back vents, they won't help to cool you off.  You have to take out the lining (the thing meant to keep you warm), you have to unzip the front vent pockets and the sleeves in order to let air IN, so it can take the hot air OUT the back vents..."
First Mfg Co Men's Mandarin collar with center zipper,Love this Jacket!,5,"Needed a solid cold weather jacket for riding, and this is definitely it. Where as I used to use mesh jackets with inner liners and still feel all the cold, this jacket is outstanding.For example, I took an excursion one weekend and the temps were about 48 when I left the house. All I had on underneath was a regular hoodie t-shirt. Temps quickly dipped down and by the time I rolled into the house, to my surprise temps had gotten into the 30's! I was on the highway for probably a solid hour as temps ducked under 40 and I was hauling ass but I didn't feel anything hit my upper extremities.Comfortable fit, I'm 6' about 225, 36"" waist.  I got the XL and its almost too big for me. For reference I have a REV-IT summer mesh jacket and 2XL is almost tight on me. I was able to transfer my CE armor from my REV-IT jacket to this jacket, but the fit is a little goofy, would probably recommend buying First Manufacturing pads for a better fit. I was just being a cheapskate since I already invested a few $100 in protection.Pockets for days, although I don't have a habit of stowing much in my jackets. Inner Liner is real solid.Above 50 degrees I'm almost sweating wearing it. 55 I have to wear a t-shirt only.In conclusion, if you need a solid cold weather jacket, this company makes some kick ass jackets. Very happy."
First Mfg Co Men's Mandarin collar with center zipper,Almost a great jacket,4,"I'm not one for black jackets but this is pretty dark for a brown jacket. I was kind of expecting that anyway from reading other reviews, but still looks really good. The pockets are great, especially the inside pockets being big enough to put a phone and a wallet in there without feel like you're trying to parallel park your belongings. It is quite a bit bit heavier than what I am used to but then again makes it perfect for colder climates where I am at. I can wear a simple long sleeve shirt under this jacket while riding in the low 30s at highway speed. I bought the medium, it is still a tad large with me being 6ft tall and 160-170lbs. But fills up fairly well with the liner and armor.With that being said, the armor pockets are really small. I had to trim down the armor I had to make them fit. The zippers on the pocket could use some tassels to make them easier to use especially with gloves on.And to get a better fit out of the jacket, I ended up getting some eyelets at Walmart and punched a fourth eyelet into the side buckles. That tightened up the jacket almost perfectly to my body."
First Mfg Co Men's Mandarin collar with center zipper,"Comfortable fit, fantastic quality.",5,"Super comfy. I ordered a medium, which is the size I usually wear in jackets and shirts. It's a bit long with my arms down, but barely raises above my wrists while riding, so it's fine. The armor pockets in the forearms and back are your standard CE pockets, but the shoulders take circular pads, not the oval shaped ones. Even without the pads, this jacket is fairly heavy, but it's not unbearable. The thermal layer actually goes down the length of the sleeves and buttons from the inside, and is nice and toasty. The mesh lining lets your torso breathe enough to get the sweat off abs the back vents let in a bit of air,  but with no front vents it can get stuffy in a hurry with it zipped all the way up. Overall I am very satisfied with this jacket, it's well worth the price tag."
First Mfg Co Men's Mandarin collar with center zipper,Fits,5,"I'm built like a barrel, 58 chest and 58 waist.  Took a chance and ordered a men's 5x.  I probably would have bought a 6x if it were available but I think that might have been too big.  A little snug around the mid-section but fits good on the way up.  I can get the zipper closed and still move around and breath.  I'm thinking it will get better with age or if I lose some weight.  Sleeves are a good length for riding.Took it for a ride on a hot day and it wasn't terrible.  Removed the liner, unzipped the sleeves,  opened the back vents, and left the front zipper down about 4-6 inches.  Seemed good while I was moving.I like the quality.  It's a heavy jacket for sure.  The only complaint is that I wish the fitment charts were a little more accurate (that is when they are available)."
First Mfg Co Men's Mandarin collar with center zipper,"The Commuter Jacket is the coolest Cafe Racer styled jacket out there, PERIOD.",4,"The Commuter Jacket is the coolest 'Cafe Racer' styled jacket out there, PERIOD.Robert on Mar 11, 2019I ride a Suzuki Burgman 650 Executive, (not a Harley) I wanted a jacket for safety, of course it had to be cool.First let me say I am pumped with the quality of this jacket, with one caveat, I would prefer the belts on the side cinch the waist tighter. I tightened them to the last notch...Anyway just a heads up guys at the jacket factory.Man, I obsessed over this coat for about a month before I ordered, reading every review on multiple sights. I was convinced that First Manufacturing was the company I would do business with. I like that they have been around since 1987, place emphasis on value first, and the quality is definitely there, YKK zippers, good leather with some imperfections, but that adds to the 'look'.I of course read about Schott NY, and Marlon Brando, man cool stuff. One problem, after reading the history of motorcycle jackets on the web, I now think I will be buying (from First Manufacturing) the Super Star, or Filmore... Both reminiscent of the Schott Perfecto, the jacket that started it all.But guy's, The Commuter Jacket is the coolest Cafe Racer styled jacket out there, PERIOD."
First Mfg Co Men's Mandarin collar with center zipper,Great quality and looks!,5,"Great quality jacket. Im 5-11, 190lbs wear a 44 regular jacket and 34 in pants. This jacket fits me perfect. Love the look of it too. Plus the zip out liner makes it a 3 season jacket."
First Mfg Co Men's Mandarin collar with center zipper,Solid Jacket,4,"Very soft and perfect fit! Other reviews say that the sleeves are too long, that's because it's a riding jacket. *Eye roll* Take it from a long time biker, this seems like solid jacket. I'll update in a few months"
First Mfg Co Men's Mandarin collar with center zipper,Worth every penny.,5,This is the best jacket for the money. The leather is of the best quality and still has a nice distressed look right out of the box. The removable liner is great for colder weather. I've ridden in 40F degree weather with just a t shirt. It doesn't come with the armor. I bought mine separate. I did have to trim the armor to fit the pockets. The concealed carry pockets are a great bonus. Ok vet happy with this jacket.
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Affordable and Real quality!!,5,"Fits perfect, I was a little skeptical at first buying it online. I actually went to a Macy’s, tried it on to see what size to order online and purchased the Medium size. I received exactly what I paid for. I ordered a black one right away too which I just got today. Very happy. Will be buying more!!"
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Poorly made,1,I have many items by this brand. They are all exceptionally nice but not this one. This is the second one as the first arrived with a snag rip. This one is cut wrong with one arm longer than the other and the sizing is incorrect. Disappointed in this item
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Wears too baggy / large on slim bodies. I have similar Adidas jacket that fits great.,4,"I purchased a small size ( i am 183 cm tall 77 kg - 6 ft / 170 lbs). This wears too baggy.I have another Adidas Essentials 3 stripes jacket that looks almost the same that has a much better fit for me.The other jacket (same size)  has smaller and higher arm sleeves, has no 3 stripes as a logo, just ""adidas"" lettering.Armpit to armpit is is 21 (if not 21.5)  inches, the other is 19.5 inches. This is probably a good fit for muscular / bigger athletic people.Too bad that Adidas does not clearly specify the fit between similar jackets. 21+ inches pit to pit sounds more like M rather than S.I love the color of this, but the fit is not good and I am returning it. It is really hard to tell the fit from the Amazon listing or Adidas site."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Just enough warmth,5,"Even when it's below 30 out, this is often my jacket of choice.  Combined with a lightweight hooded sweatshirt, it keeps me comfortable, just so long as the wind isn't too bad.  I overheat in most things just standing still, and this keeps me at just the right temp, whether standing around, or doing some work.  Plus, I always prefer more subdued color schemes with my clothes.  The dark green and black is perfect for me."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Amazing color and fit!,5,"Bought it in a blue/teal color and the color is really great! Received many compliments from friends and even drunk people off the street. Fit is good, except a little longer at the bottom.Easy to wash in washer, just wash it inside out, zipped up in cold wash with a gentle detergent...color doesn't seem to fade after a few washes... hopefully it'll last year's looking prestime!"
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Real Tricot,5,"el azul se muy bonito y brilla pero Se descolora después de 2 años el material es bueno  no es malo pero me gusta descolorado se ve mas vintage, cubre bien cuando hace frio, aquí en Dominican Republic,  es un jacket especial para navegar en este planeta creado por Dios."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Looking sharp in my Adidas,5,"This is what you would expect from a track jacket made by a reputable sports company.  It is well constructed and comfortable.  The arms are the same length, the zipper works and it has the 3 unmistakable stripes of Adidas.  Works well in a variety of situations as long as your goal is to look good."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Satisfaction,5,"This is a nice and extremely comfortable garment. The material has the right weight and feel to it so you know it’s quality, but it still breathes really well. My only criticism is that I feel like the logo should have been embroidered, but instead it’s sort of thickly silk screened. Regardless, this is a nice piece that I look forward to showing off."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Defective Item,1,"Item was torn. I bought it in October as a gift for someone, seeing that the time wasn't chilly as yet I didn't really check the item- partly my fault. Anyhow, I had to throw it out...."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Classic,5,For years I have admired Adidas gear. But I recently decided to get the classic tops and bottoms and they are on point. Love the comfort level and fit. Highly recommended!
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Runs short,5,"This jacket is phenomenal in every way, except for the fact that the sizes run a little bit small or I should say short, I ordered the double XL, but it wasn't long enough so I had to send it back.  Still waiting for the tall version to come out, So if you are taller this probably wont-work for you unless you can get the tall version, other than that it's great"
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Cheaply made,3,I wasn't expecting the Adidas brand per se but this is a cheap knockoff it's cheaply-made considering if you're in the know of Adidas friends.
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,"Okay, nice looking, polyester 😔",4,"Made of cheap polyester, I remember when they were made of stronger, smoother Nylon blend material. Looks like it's cheap, will create fuz balls after a few washes. It's okay, because of the price, material could be better."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Now you can cop the eastern European swag.,5,"I pretty much live in Adidas tracksuits because they are like wearing pajamas but not looking like a slob. I am 6'3"" and 195 lbs and I got the large pants and xl jacket. The pants are perfect but the jacket is a bit big. That isn't the jackets fault it's mine for my upper body being built like a 12 year old. Get a large jacket if you are tall and slim."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,"Great product, good quality, comfortable and fits as expected",5,"Bought this set to wear after knee surgery and it is great. So comfortable, convenient and great to wear in the fall/winter even just around the house, let alone for follow-up visits to the orthopedic surgeon. The quality is fine. I have washed both the jacket and pants at least 6-8 times since purchase and they are holding up as good as new. Highly recommend!"
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Red Adidas Jacket,5,"Great color. Great value, Nice fit. Would rather have bought the whole set....., Still a good deal, Much cheaper than the store price.I highly recommend!"
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Love it.,5,"This jacket is perfect! I live in Las Vegas, so this is light weight, but also keeps you warm. I bought one size bigger because I like my comfy wear to be oversized and it doesn’t feel too big. It looks really good with my black Adidas track pants too!"
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Nice track jacket,5,Saw this on sale for $25 so I had to get it.I’m very pleased with it. It will be a nice jacket for spring and fall.
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,"It looks good, but fails at almost everything else.",2,"This jacket looks good, and you'll look good wearing it. That is the only compliment I can afford it.I doubt a lot of people who bought this jacket did it for warmth factor, but its worth mentioning that you're better off wearing two shirts than bringing this thing out in the cold.Putting this jacket on is not a good experience. The inside material feels awful. It's so thin that is borderline see-through."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,My Adidas!,5,"This jacket is as I expected.  I have stuck with Adidas for years.  I purchased this jacket for a theme party, but it works just as great when I’m exercising!"
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,stylish,5,i bought this jacket in both black and white and i love the way both of them look. maybe one day i'll have all the colors
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Great jacket,5,Jacket is excellent. Fits just right and very stylish Can definitely wear spring summer fall
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,a little snugger fit,4,The fit is a little snug to the skin than I like but that seems to be the trend. Perfect weight for those cooler temps in fall/spring days.
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,"Short waist, feels very cheap",1,The waist line of this jacket is very short. Ordered an XL and the sleeves are a good length but the waist is too short to call it comfortable. Jacket feels a bit thin and cheap too.
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,Super comfortable,5,"FIrst off, this is a great jacket.  High quality.  One thing though, I recommend getting a size up.  Super roomy."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,FAR thinner than they used to be,2,"I have one of these jackets from years ago, and it is much thicker material.  It would at least keep me warm on my outside runs during the autumn and early spring seasons.  The jacket now is paper thin, and won't serve the purpose at all.  I had hoped to purchase it in a small as my previous one was a medium and is now too big.  Alas, I'll be looking elsewhere for a running jacket."
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,When buying you should get 1 size up,2,I have 2 other Tricot tracks like this.Somehow these are a little tight.They say XL but they are really LShould of just bought 1 😫
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,You can’t wash it unfortunately.,1,The jacket was completely ruined with multiple patches of shrinkage and fuzzy fabric texture after the first washing before use. It was really nice prior to the wash. Disappointed. I can’t return it now. It looks like it’s been worn for a year.
adidas Men's Essentials 3-Stripes Tricot Track Jacket,our son loved it. I would definitely buy it again in ...,5,"The pictures don’t really show but it seems to be made of a glossy nylon material. Either way, our son loved it. I would definitely buy it again in the Black/ gold colorway if they had it for our younger son. We see these jackets go on sale often, so it’s just a matter of time."

Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Jacket runs a bit big especially if you're a girl,5,So I bought this jacket knowing it was for men cause I wanted something a little loose and big cause that's how I like my jackets and I know I won't find anything like that in the women's section. I just wanted something plain with no writing or designs on it. In saying this I normally wear size small to medium clothes. I was going to buy a medium for the jacket and thought not mainly cause I read the reviews and they said the jacket normally runs a little big. So I bought a small instead and I was glad I did because this fits on me like a medium to a large would.I hope this helps any women who wants to buy this product. Also it feels nice and soft and it's warm!
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Classic, comfortable hoodie at a great value!",5,"To me, this is a perfect zip-front hoodie and is exactly what I was looking for.Fit: I'm 6' 1"" tall but have proportionally short legs and a tall upper body. If my legs were longer, I'd be close to 6'5"" tall. I know because that's how tall my sons are and they have the same upper body as me. I'm a big guy too at about 260+ lbs. right now. The XX-Large fits me perfectly. The sleeves are long enough and the jacket is a generous length at the waist without being too long. I love a little extra room in the shoulders and around the chest and under the arms. This hoodie has that type of cut which gives it a feeling of effortless comfort. I can move my arms and upper body easily and do everything from yard work to throwing a football without the jacket binding up. By the way, I tried the XXX-Large first because I wanted a comfortable fit and XXX-Large was just too big for me. Amazon took the return, sweet and easy, and I'm glad I traded down in size. Amazon is amazing in this way. You can buy with confidence. XX-Large is absolutely the right fit for me. I would say the fit is as expected but a touch on the roomy side, which I like.Feel: I think this hoodie is an excellent weight. I know it says heavyweight but everything is relative. I'd realistically call it a medium weight which I like very much. It's heavy enough to throw on for a crisp, late fall, morning walk in Upstate New York with my wife but it breathes well so I don't get overheated. For me, I'd say the jacket is good by itself for about 40 to about 60 degrees F. Any colder or if it's windy and it works great as a layer as I add an outer shell coat. As it gets warmer, I'll wear it unzipped until I just don't need it any more. Then it's easy to take off and light to carry. I'll sometimes throw it on around the house on a cool day like a sweater. It's easy to wear.Fabric: Mine is 90% cotton, 10% polyester. The exterior has a normal, dense-cotton, sweatshirt-type shell which helps to make it a bit more wind resistant. The interior is a nice soft brushed poly fleece which feels great next to your skin and wicks away any sweat. Very comfortable overall.Features: The zipper is reasonably heavy and mine works easily and smoothly. The front pockets are deep, roomy and comfortable. They are perfectly placed and cut right to easily rest your hands inside and feel secure without putting pressure on your forearms. The hood is just fine and feels right on my back. I will rarely, if ever, actually use the hood but the jacket just wouldn't feel right without it and it's nice to have there if I ever need it. The hood lays well and doesn't get in my way.Overall: I'm very happy with this full zip-front hoodie. It's a classic and just what I wanted for those times and activities when you need a comfortable, lived-in, sweat jacket. At those times nothing else is quite right. This one is perfect. Highly recommended!!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Not a fan of the women casual jackets on Amazon, but this makes a nice alternative!",4,"I purchased this jacket because I’m not a fan of what amazon offers in the women’s department. I wanted something simple for casual wear. No big brand logo needed. So far, I really like it!  It washed well and soft. I definitely need an xs but it’s not an option, so the small works fine.After almost a month, this jacket is starting to show decent wear. I still like this for chilling at home but I’m surprised how much the material is balling up, particularly on the sleeves."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Broken zipper,1,"This is a nice long heavyweight jacket. We purchased this a little over a month ago. My 13 yo son has worn this to school a few times, as he loves long jackets. Upon our first washing of it this evening in a front load washer and the he he put it on to go to the movies, the zipper has come un-sewn.  I've never had an issue with Hanes product, but this should last a month.  It may be fluke with the sewjob, but this is now unwearable.  Also beware when you do wash it, the drawstrings are braided and his ""poofed up"" and separated. There are positives about the jacket which he did like. It did have a nice thick hood. It did not look like a cheap jacket. We are not blessed with tiny frames, hence the xxl, but the jacket was long enough to cover and be loose on him when he sat down. He is 5'10 250.  Attached are pictures of the zipper and the tag so you can see material composition if interested."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Quality is horrible now,1,"The quality of these hoodies has really gone down. After just one wash, the drawstrings were completely shredded. It's too bad because they used to be pretty good sweatshirts but they aren't anymore. Time for a Weights and Measures Dept. that makes sure products being sold actually hold up."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Baggy body, short length, short arms, bulging zipper.",1,"My body type matches the fitness models in the photos, and thus, the hoodie should fit me the same as it fits in the photos. Unfortunately, it absolutely does not fit the same at all.  I will never buy another Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Fleece Hoodie because it's really baggy in the body, short in the arms, short in the length and has a ridiculous looking bulging zipper. The zipper is hyper conspicuous because it bulges out in roller coaster shapes, and its all shiny metal. The fabric doesn't hide the zipper. But the horrible fit and bulging stiff zipper is the worst I've seen. I regret the purchase. I decided to buy an alternate brand (American Apparel Flex Fleece Zip Hoodie) as a replacement."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Cut on the larger side, and not tightly, seems well made for the price, has large pockets.",5,"I'm happy with my purchase. It met my 3 major criteria. 1: It fit me. It's harder to find 3X and above. This 3X seems larger than the last couple of hoodie jackets I had from another brand. It's definitely a little longer. (I have to adjust to moving it aside to get into my pants pockets. Not a big deal.) And, I think, a little bit bigger overall. If I'd known Hanes cut their 3Xs this large, I could have got away with a 2X--or maybe what I really needed was a 2 1/2X--which nobody manufactures. Fortunately, I like my clothing loose so larger is a plus for me. As a bonus, the pockets are definitely larger which I consider a major plus. I can easily wear a sweater or sweat shirt under it. 2: It was affordable. It cost me around $25 with shipping. It was not the least expensive hoodie listed but it was towards the low end so I wasn't expecting what I would with a more expensive garment. For instance, the zipper is not heavy duty, but, looks like it should work for a number of years. Hanes products seem decent to me in their price range. It doesn't feel as heavy weight as my last similar jackets. My current winter coat is thinner and lighter than any other I've owned but keeps me as warm. Perhaps this fabric will do the same. If it is lighter weight and won't be as warm, that would be a plus. I still have my heavier jacket. This is primarily for Spring and Fall. I assume it will be too hot for Summer. Today I wore it for the third time. It was in the low 60's and a bit windy. It worked fine and kept out the wind. After a while, with the sun out, I had to wear it open. Third: It was in a color I wanted. I wanted either black or dark green. Both were available. My other jacket is black, so I ordered dark green for this one. I think it looks good. I think it looks good on me. I haven't used the hood--I rarely do, but it looks like it will do it's job. So, if my criteria come close to yours, I recommend purchasing this."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Hoodie runs large.,5,"Bought this hoodie to tie dye. It's 90% cotton 10% polyester, good fiber content for tie dying.  I bought a size medium because I thought it would fit my female frame sufficiently. I'm normally a size large/xlarge in tops, 12/14, 5'3"" and 155 pounds. The medium was way too big. Sleeves way too long. I gave it to my thick 25 year old son who's about 5'4"", 16 inch dress shirt, (large/xlarge men's t-shirt) 36 inch waist and 183 pounds. It fit him almost perfectly. The sleeves were a bit too long but the cuff keeps the sleeves from going over his hands. I reordered a small for myself. Prices were very reasonable. Both times I ordered and waited for the hoodies to be stocked. I washed in cold water and hung to dry. No shrinkage. This hoodie takes color from tulip dye very well. I recommend."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Get what you pay for...,1,Reviewing “ Ultimate Heavyweight Fleece Hoodie”. I ordered the XL of this size for men. Got it put it on. Felt rough. Not soft. Thought maybe a wash would fix it. Nope. Still a rough cotton feel.Also noticed the fit was square shape rather than the typical rectangle shape most expect from a hoodie. So it was too much on the sides and not enough length.Bottom line. If you need something cheap to keep you warm and don’t mind it not being soft on your skin then sure go for these. But if you like your hoodie to be soft pass these up. I’ll probably donate these(bought 2) after covid-19 passes since returning for a refund isn’t an option(lock down).
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Massively oversized sleeves,2,"I ordered a Hanes hoodie on here recently. It was that common style thin zipper hoodie and it was the perfect fit. I figured as fall and eventually, winter starts getting here I'll want something a little warmer so I ordered this hoodie expecting a similar overall fit and quality. Nope. At least not on the fit side.Quality: felt nice, very soft, nice and thick but not parka in the northern tundra thick. Very impressed for the money on that part.Size: The main body wasn't off too much though a bit larger than expected (definitely not a fitted cut to it). However, the sleeves were about 3x wider than they should have been. Around the forearm to wrist it felt fine but from the elbow to the armpit... man... you would think they designed it to store honeybaked hams in there.  Absolutely massive. I put the hoodie on and had about (not exaggerating) 10 inches of extra sleeve hanging below my arm when holding my arms straight out from my body. It actually looked like the sleeve was designed for a 500lb person and that's legitimately the most accurate way I can describe it.Overall, the quality was fantastic but without knowing if the sizing being so drastically off was by design or a defect I can't give this hoodie a review over 2 stars because there's no way to make that work. Normally a large is the perfect size for me but not with this hoodie. Consider a medium or even small... or just opt for the ""try it for free"" option that a lot of clothes come with.One extra note: I have a Kohls in the parking lot of my apartment which makes returns super easy to do (even though I probably return less than 1% of what I buy). Even though this order was fulfilled by Amazon and had the ""try it for 7 days"" option, I couldn't return it to Kohls. Not a huge deal but keep in mind that you can't always return items to Kohls despite it being fulfilled by Amazon."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,A little large but good,5,"To be clear I bought this to replace my work hoodie, the picture is trivial but figured it still share how it arrived. I am an outdoor forklift operator (in a sealed cab) so I am in and out of the weather all year round... my lift has heat so I don't need an extremely thick hoodie to keep me warm in the winter.Pros:+Decently Thick Material+Slightly Baggy+Zipper actually works well+Vibrant black (not faded)+Big hood (nice for hats/beanies)+Price is fairCons:-Arrived out of the sealed bag with some weird residue on it... quality is questionable-Baggy (depending on how you want it to fit)-Pockets are average or possible slightly smaller than what I expected.-Hoodie strings seem cheap/probably won't endure many washes before shrinkingHonestly... for the price this is a good purchase. I think if you went to Walmart and tried to buy something comparable to this within the same price range you'd have a lower quality/thinner hoodie. Anymore shopping for hoodies they have become a little pricey for what you get... I was surprised how thin the $35/$45 department store NAME BRAND hoodies were.... seems like you have to pay a little north of $40 to get a decently thick one these days.Will update if anything changes."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Great hoodie for women too!,5,"I live on a farm in the panhandle of Fl. It gets cold here but not too cold for too long. I dress in layers so when I get overheated, I remove my barn coat and still am warm and comfortable wearing this hoodie. It's a sturdy 90% cotton fabric with a baby soft lining, roomy pockets, and I love the hood, especially on wet windy days. It keeps my neck warm and the zipper keeps out the cold.I bought 4 of these in different colors, size Small. I am 5'5"" and normally wear a size 8. The sleeves are a little long on me but I can just roll or push them up. I toss the hoodies in the washer and then pull out of the dryer while still damp and let air dry on a hanger. I just couldn't find comparable hoodies for my lifestyle in women's sizes. And you can't beat the price! I will probably order a few more."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,NOT heavyweight,1,"Apparently Hanes has no idea what a heavyweight hoodie is.  This is more like a medium-to-light weight.  The quality isn't that great, either.  The fabric around the zipper twists and pulls around, so when it's zipped closed, the zipper is visible in some parts of the shirt and covered in other parts.  A good hoodie looks nicer than that."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,it fits good. It sort of looks on me like the ...,5,"I bought the medium size and it fits just right for me. Even after washing it, it fits good. It sort of looks on me like the guy on the picture of this add. My weight is 188 lbs and i'm 5'7"". I had previously bought the large size thinking it would fit me good and after a few washes it did shrink a bit but not enough. It was still baggy. Its warm, soft, well made, thick but not too thick. It's a great jacket for my taste. I would definitely buy again.Update: 11/3/17I accidentally dried the sweater in a pretty high temperature and it shrunk. It doesn't fit anymore. You can see my back if I bend forward a bit. I didn't dock it any stars because it's still nice. I gave it to my girlfriend and it fits her better than me."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Amazing!,5,"I would 100% recommend this product to anyone who wants it. I bought a light steel in a size small. My height is 5’8. My weight is 120 pounds. I am quite tall and skinny, and I was worried that it was going to be too baggy on me even the small one. But it wasn’t actually, because it was 85% cotton it wasn’t too baggy. It felt nice and soft, very easy too not too heavy. It wasn’t bulky. Since it is a men’s, it was a bit larger on me than I expected because I am a skinny girl. It was slightly oversized, but not too much which I liked a lot. I expected it to be huge on me even the small but it was quite nice. I loved the hood a lot because it was big enough that I could put it on my head and it didn’t pull on the back of the sweatshirt. I hate when the hood is too small and pulls on your shirt and it feels awkward. 10/10 recommend if you are a girl and looking for something cozy with the right amount of oversized and not too bulky. :)"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Good Sweater,4,"This is a nice comfy zip up! It's well made with a strong zipper. The weight of the material is perfect for cool weather or to layer with. The only thing is I found it a little ""generous"" in the cut. I consider myself a size ""LARGE AND A HALF"", most times I find large  to be a little tight and extra large too big. After reading a lot of the reviews prior to purchasing, I decided on a XL but that was gigantic, I was swimming in it looking like a homeless person. So I returned it and got a large. Even still I feel like the large is big but I settled for it thinking a medium maybe tighter than I like. I prefer a little space as opposed to tight."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,DO NOT PURCHASE!!,1,"The first thing I noticed were the cloth tags sewed into the neck of the sweat shirt. Since when did Hanes go back to those annoying neck tags? I slipped it on to check the fit (OK) then went about the tag removal process. Then I put it on and tried to zip it up. Lots of trouble but finally got it working. Then I noticed that with it zipped up, the zipper line protruded. No fix for this. If I hadn't removed the tags it would have been returned. I suspect that this shirt is a ""knock off."""
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Cuddly, soft, economical and beautiful so I will order several in different colors",5,"I ordered a size too large so I’m exchanging it and smaller size would be perfect, very soft and beautiful, perfect! I like it for myself as a woman because I like the length of which is difficult to find in a woman’s zipped hoodie. I also feel it’s made better than women’s.Update, the small just arrived and it’s perfect.I just received the same one in dark brown, it’s perfect! True to size. No reason to order one size up. I’m a size small and the small fit me well with plenty of room to make it comfortable and to be able to layer. If you order a size up it will likely be very boxy and fattening, unflattering."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,FITS PERFECTLY!,5,"Fits PERFECT! Easy to move with, also fits true to size, I’m a medium n I still have plenty of room"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Bad packaging and runs a bit bigger.,4,The packaging was not good. It was rolled up in the shipping package with no extra covering. There were orange marker marks on the inside of one sleeve. It looked like a returned package with no inspection. As for the fit it was good. I am 5”10 and 147lbs female and ordered an xl because I wanted oversized but it was a little bigger than I wanted. I’ve never bought men’s clothing so I don’t know if it was true to size. The ash color however looks almost white which i love because it makes you look “clean”. Also the material is not heavy enough to keep you warm during the winter. The inside is nice and soft and comfy. It should be great for layering however. I would have given this thing a five star rating if not for the packaging. For the price however I would recommend this to anybody.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Size L fits like an XL,1,"I purchased a large, which according to the size chart, should fit a size 42""-44"" chest. The item I received measures as an XL (despite having a size L tag), that measures 25"" across from armpit to armpit, which would fit a size 50"" chest.  Either this was an incorrectly tagged item from the manufacture, or the size chart on the page is incorrect.While I like the overall design, the size is way off.  Attempting to get a refund or replacement.  Will update my rating to reflect customer service."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,THIS IS NOT THE SWEATSHIRT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,1,The 90/10 cotton/poly combination is the worst of both worlds.  It doesn't feel nice and it's still not even keeping its shape.This is the third Hanes sweatshirt I've owned and even though it's the same size (and color for that matter) as the other two the pockets on this one are noticeably smaller.  WHY???!!!It is pretty obvious why American Giant does so well even though their sweatshirts are $100 plus.  This Hanes product sucks.  The only reason I bought this is because my American Giant sweatshirt is too heavy for the summer.I guess I'm in the market for a new cotton sweatshirt with a hood.  Again.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,85-90% cotton is a durable fabric for both indoor and outdoor wearing,5,"Theses Hanes hoodies are made mostly of cotton and this fabric withstands the test of heavy-duty working situations.  I own several of these in a variety of colors and all of them maintain their shape after repeated laundering. As everyone knows, cotton does shrink, but this cotton blend resists that tendency for the most part. Still, since my arms are a little long, I always gently stretch the sleeves after washing and before drying to give me a little extra sleeve length. As always, to preserve the deep dye colors, use a gentle wash cycle with cool water and a low temperature drying cycle to preserve the shape. These practices have kept my hoodies in near new condition.If you are accustomed to the Hanes 50-50 cotton/polyester blend of hoodies, then this will be a pleasant change for you. The fabric is heavier, feels warmer, does not pill, and the interior pile stays together."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Perfectly fitting warm sweat shirt with a hoody,5,The feel is good with a considerable amount of warmth. Good for temperatures upto 40-50F based on how cold you generally feel. The size recommendations are exact and no complaints on the material of the hoody.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,LOVE this hoodie,5,"I LOVE this hoodie. I like my hoodies oversized and I find that men’s are always softer and cozier, so that’s why I ordered this one. I will say that it seems to  run a lot larger than most of the men’s sweatshirts I have. I’m 5’2 and 135lbs. I typically order a large or x large because I like them really big, and with this one I was able to order a medium and achieve that same look. It’s extremely well made and very sturdy. I’m hoping that the white comes back in stock so that I can order that one as well!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Not soft and has tags,2,"The description clearly says ""All the comfort of Hanes with our famous tag-free collar"". Many lies in that one sentence. As you can see in the picture I attached, not only does it have a tag, it has two! Also it is not comfortable. I am used to fleece jackets being soft. This one is hard and not soft. Previous fleece jackets I've had have been even softer inside than outside, but this is the same material both places, the hard material. The whole jacket seems low quality. The zipper is horrible. Not easy to zip. It wasn't made right. You have to dig and pull the left side rectangle part of the zipper out of the jacket to get it to go into the moving zip part. It's not an easy thing to zip like previous fleece jackets I've had.  Overall I'm not happy with this jacket. I thought I could count on Hanes to be comfortable and good quality. I guess I will not be buying jackets anymore on Amazon, as it's not worth it if you can't try it on first and see the quality."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"It's an OK hoodie.  Well made, small pockets and hood.  Not the warmest for Northeast winter.",3,"First, I live in the Northeast and this time of year it can get pretty cold (December).  I bought this hoping for some relief without being too bogged down with heavy layers.I wear this with a midweight thermal layer and another layer of fleece.  It's OK.  You can definitely feel the wind just tear through this.  I have to wear another layer on top of this one to help keep in the heat.  Not really what I was looking for or what the description indicated.  This will be a good fall/spring hoodie.It feels well made and fits good.  Maybe a little baggy around the waist.  My complaints are the pockets are way too small and the hood is way too small.  The hood doesn't fit well over a normal baseball cap, which doesn't work well for my intended purpose.Overall a decent hoodie, but I will keep looking for winter wear.  This maybe one of those things that you just can't go cheap on."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Well made, nice weight, comfortable hoodie, bought 2!",5,"Really nice & perfect for our climate in S. Texas. It is rarely below 50* F here so this is great & for me keeps me toasty in those cold grocery stores. I got a small for me (i like a loser fit & my husband got a large. Very happy. I was so surprised when I got him his & he asked me to get one also so we could wear them together. Awww so sweet. Would recommend delivered promptly & in great condition. I love the full zipper as I'm in & out of my hoodie & hate messing up my hair. Also I can leave it open when it's not so cool & have some temperature control. Nice quality, stitching & material. For the price, excellent product! I'm truly confused by some of the negative reviews. This is a nice hoodie, well made & a great weight & material. I truly would give it a try. The zipper is fine. It's well made. I think you'll,agree w/ me. I don't understand the negative reviews at all"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,I (Kinda) Recommend this Hoodie (edited review)!,3,"Fits really well and feels great.  It is very soft and feels like it will last at least a little while.  I bought a much more expensive, 100% cotton product from Nike, but plan on returning the Nike product and keeping the Hanes because this Hanes product fits better, feels better, and is almost as nice at less than a third the cost!Update:  I've had the hoodie for about six months and have revised my review from four stars to three.  The hoodie started to get stretched out of shape, so I tossed it in the dryer.  Major mistake -- the thing is now a bit worse for wear.  This hoodie will not last.  It is only as sturdy as its price suggests it will be.  I bet I'll be shopping for a replacement all too soon!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Do not buy very cheaply made,1,I wish hanes would have better quality control man this seams messed up it does fit to I usually wear a large and ordered a 2Xl to have room to layer underneath it the color does not match the picture and the list goes on I truly think I got a defective one the zipper doesn't even work right I don't have time to return it I wish hanes would send me the same sweater in a different color because they have been getting better I don't know if this was a freak mistake or not??¿? I think I might of got a bad batch or something so I cannot say to take you're chances just stay away
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"""Ultimate Heavyweight""  ??  Hoodie.....",4,"Well, a new fall/winter season is upon us here in New England. Time for a new hooded sweatshirt methinks. Bought this one and was mislead a little by the term ""Ultimate Heavyweight"" The sweatshirt is a bit heavier than some I've seen but ""Ultmate""...Hmmm, naw.  Don't get me wrong, This sweatshirt is fairly heavy but I seem to remember them being heavier in the past. I got this one for $20 in black so, I am pleased with it for that price. But as an outdoorsman, I will most likely go for a cotton one with a lining and give this one to my wife....The zipper gives me a headache...It's not ""Ultimate"" enough...It's quite thin and difficult to get started. But again, for a $20 price tag....It's pretty good. 4⭐ Overall."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,I am giving 5 stars for the fast shipping and the review part is,5,The Hanes sweatshirt is not as heavy as the Gildan and I have been trying all the brands to see the quality between them. So far The Gildan was made heavier than the Hanes and heavier than the fruit of the Loom but not as good as the Columbia the Columbia was far ahead of all of them with the softness and quality  The Champion is not even close to the Columbia. I would try to get the name brands from the department stores such as macys they seem to be more legitimate. I got my Columbia from Macys for 24.00 dollars this week from 50.00 On  Sale. It seems to be hit or miss on Amazon if you get a real product or not. It is too bad for that as I used to buy everything with confidence here but after a few duds and I know fake products I have lost my confidence especially with perfumes
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"I have been wearing this for 9 months, the entire pandemic.",5,"This has become my cartoon character uniform for my daily software scrum meetings. I put it on, and everyone says, ""Hey, it's Mike, wearing his red hoody!"" So that's fun. The hoodie is warm, and the hood is great at deflecting the giant turbines that are always running. I get a lot of joy out of using the zipper. It has an amazing tactile experience, of metal interacting with metal. The zipper is very smooth and I always enjoy both putting the hoodie on, and then later on during the day, removing it to wear a different hoodie. For the cost, I give this five stars. After being laundered, it will be a little less soft, but that is always the case with a new hoodie. I like the red color. Sometimes I cover my hands with the sleeves and pretend I am a lobster, free in the ocean and not stuck inside at home. Would buy again."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Soft fleece lining, vibrant color, well constructed",5,"This Hanes hoodie was listed as ""heavyweight"", which I didn't find entirely accurate, but perhaps that's subjective, idk.  While it's not thin, I wouldn't consider it heavyweight when compared to a heavy hoodie that I am replacing it with.  Regardless, it is well constructed and has a soft fleece lining, with the exception of the hood.I'm 6', ~150 lbs, slender, and due to my height, I usually find large is the best fit.  I found this hoodie to be a little larger in the arms and torso than I was anticipating.  I haven't washed it yet, but the laundering instructions read ""wash in cold water and dry on low heat"".  Since it's 90/10 cotton/poly material, I'm not sure if shrinkage will occur; maybe if washed in hot water and dried hot, but should you attempt that, wash it separately to avoid the color from bleeding onto other garments.I've chosen to keep this hoodie rather than exchange it for a medium, mainly because it's easy to remove and won't appear so bulky on occasions this winter when layering is required."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Very comfortable sweatshirt and perfect for wearing on those cooler days,5,"Very comfortable sweatshirt and perfect for wearing on those cooler days! I will say, it shrinks a LOT when you wash it (even in cold water). I ordered it a size bigger than I normally wear because I wanted it to be roomy and comfortable, and it seemed another size or two larger than that when I first got it. The sleeves went past my fingertips a good 5 or 6 inches. However, after washing, the sleeves reach my knuckles and it's the size I was looking for in the first place! Not complaining, but I figured I'd let people know they should keep that in mind when ordering! Still, it's great quality and it's been making it through my work days with me no problem. Love it."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Very nice! now try it for yourselves.,5,"Very nice !!!  Soft. For my particular body, according to the chart that tells you o.k. we recommend this size for you. The size is o.k. it's a little larger than a size ""Lg."" But NOT by a lot. Which is a very good thing because, if and when it may shrink (if it does), then it would look and feel as it were tailored made for you. A tip I learned years ago, if and when a garment shrinks due to the dryer, rewash it in cold water 🌊 with Downy fabric softener in the wash. This relaxes the fibers and inlarges the garment back to it's original size. Don't tell anyone. Let it be your little secret. DO NOT USE a generic fabric softener. Then what you do is air dry it. Do not put it in the dryer or you'll be back to square one. ( A shrunken whatever). Hopes this helps. G.C."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Decent Quality, Good Zipper, Too Large",2,"The quality of the fabric was really nice and had a good medium weight to it. The zipper was pretty good too. But the draw string for the hood was not so great, It was made of a loose weave and didn't look like it would last very long.I bought this to layer underneath my jackets when it's colder.I actually would have been ok with the sweatshirt if it weren't too big. I have another hoodie from the same brand (Hanes) and size medium also. But this sweatshirt runs at least a whole size larger than its intended size.The other hoodie I have (Hanes ecosmart fleece hoodie) had a zipper of 22 inches, this zipper was at least 23.5 inches long, about an 1.5 inch longer. The shoulder width was a little bit wider also, at least a quarter inch to half inch on both sides. Definitely fit more like a large than a medium.I recommend sizing down if you plan on getting this hoodie."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Tiny Pockets,4,"I'm rough on my hoodies, which is why come the new year; I always buy a new one to get me thru the year.Having been a fan of a couple other brands over the years; thought I'd try Champion this time around just to be different.After a week or so of use I can attest to a high quality, warm, even cozy hoodie.  The reason why I bother with a review is because the slash pockets are very tiny, and shallow.  I have large hands, and they need pockets deep enough to keep them warm on cold breezy mornings, and these leave half my hand looking for cover in the cold air.  If you are looking for deep pockets, keep looking."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Run A Little Large, Metal Zipper is Aggressive",2,"My third hoodie purchased during the quarantine. This one has a reasonable price, color looks good, but it's sized a little large (it was bigger than expected), it's a little more heavy weight than expected (fine if you're going out in the cold, but a little much around the house or in warmer weather), and the zipper is pretty sharp metal. Some people will love the metal zipper because of the feel or sound, but I prefer polymer zippers (quieter, more durable, etc). The metal zipper on this particular hoodie seems pretty aggressive like it will jam in the future and/or shred other clothes while in the dryer. I don't normally complain about zippers, but this one feels like Piranha teeth. Make sure to keep it zipped up when you wash it with other items or tumble dry."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Will Shrink after Washing,5,"I like Hooded Sweaters to toss on while doing chores outside, this one works just fine, I bought 2 1 for me and 1 for my wife. (that way she is not taking mine all the time) I bought a Size Larger because it seems like all these sweaters shrink after washing, it was a little Large to start with but after the first washing it is just right, these are nice quality and should last a year or so for me, Outside Farm chores is hard on these sweaters, so I will be getting another one in a year or so."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,So nice I bought another one,5,"My old hoodie died and i spent a lot of time looking for a mostly cotton one that didn't cost $50 or more.  bought a man's size rather than a women's because I wanted the irksomeness to go over layers when needed. The first one I bought was so soft, so comfortable, so snugly warm so exactly what I'd been looking for that I ordered a second . the only minor flaw I found in the first one was a sticky zipper, but I found that if I wash the hoodie with the zipper zipped up, I don't have that problem, As for the ratings- the light weight doesn't really apply, This is a heavy weight hoodie."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Zipper not laying flat after washing,2,"I have looked and looked for a heavy weight black hooded zip sweatshirt. It is heavy weight, runs a little large, but just what I was looking for to layer in the cold Minnesota winters. I washed the sweatshirt for the first time and the metal zipper buckled, became bumpy and would not lay flat. I washed it again this time laying flat and pulling the zipper to help it lay down. This is the second attempt and the zipper still is all bumpy and when you put it on it does not have a smooth look to the front, bulging because of the zipper.  Very disappointing, had this not happened I would have really enjoyed this sweatshirt. Will be returning!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Deep Navy = Navy,5,"I ordered a Large in this sweatshirt in the ""Navy"" color but then decided I might instead need a Medium.  The best price with free returns for the Medium was available in the color ""Deep Navy,"" but when it arrived, it was actually the same as the Navy sweatshirt (packaging on both said ""Navy"" with identical SKU numbers).  I wound up keeping the Large one.  Overall, this seems like an excellent sweatshirt - very heavy fabric and high (90%) cotton content.  Note that the Amazon site lists some other colors as 90% or even 100% cotton, but that's not always accurate.  The Hanes website accurately shows the true fabric content for the various colors."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,It’s pretty standard. HUGE tho,4,"If you’re looking for oversized just get your size because I’m usually a medium so I got a large and it’s HUGEEEE like waaaaay too big. The material is mega cheap and kinda not worth the price if you ask me, I’ve found comfier jackets at Walmart. It gets the job done though I guess, it’s pretty lightweight and fleece-ish inside so it’s soft enough against the skin.  Follow me on Instagram @faeryminx !!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Not bad at all for the price, but I shall continue my search.",5,"Not bad at all for the price, but I shall continue my search for the right zip up. The fabric is a night light to mid-weight. i consider the brand ""Pro Club"" fleece to be heavy and the Dickies fleece to be mid-weight. Hanes offers a nice selection of colors, but their tag is pretty big and hard to remove without breaking a few seams on neckline. The hood isn't bad. It billows on me though, not sure if this would get fixed when washed but decided to return and continue my search for the right zip-up. Found Dickies mid-weight to be my favorite."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,TERRIBLE!!! - Poorly designed and poorly made.  You would expect better from Hanes,1,"Problem is :1- the sweat shirt shrinks, but the metal zipper doesn't.  As a result, the zipper puckers out and will not lay flat.2- the puckered zipper causes the stitching on each side of the zipper to roll outward exposing the zipper.  It's what you see3- unzipped, the puckered zipper causes the sweatshirt to roll outward.4- the seams where the hood attach are not well made and extend beyond the hood.  When you zip up, those seams poke into your neck.5- has a thick, heavy label that rubs on the back of your neck6- made in HondurasLike:1- it is a nice heavy weight"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Wrong Size, itchy tag, otherwise fine.",4,"Soft hoodie, good quality- however, I ordered a size small and was sent a size medium. It doesn't matter to the point where I feel like going through the hassle of a return, but it might be important for anyone else. Also, the tag is very itchy so it will need to be removed."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Hoped for the best, isn't as good as what I'd hoped",2,"I bought this with the intention of heat pressing a surprise hoodie for the hubby. Seemed okay when I ordered, though I wasn't a super big fan of the feel. If I had to rate it on a spectrum, I would say it's more on the rough end, not a nice soft cotton. (I ordered the Black XL.)True for heat pressing anything, I washed and dried it first. Holy. Shrinkage. It is SO SHORT now compared to his other hoodies. I can put on his hoodies and they come halfway down my thigh after a washing. This one sits higher, almost mid/high waist. I guess I would've assumed they would've designed/made this knowing where it should fall AFTER a washing and drying. My regret is two-fold: not ordering a softer/higher quality hoodie - and if I was going to stick with this one, ordering a 2XL instead.Out the money because I've washed, dried, and heat pressed. Won't use Hanes for future hoodie designs - I'll pay a little more to get what I'm looking for. Bummed."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Buy 1 down from what you actually are,3,"This Medium Size Deep Navy Heavyweight Hoodie isn't quite accurate as advertized.I ordered a Medium because according to the size chart, anyone with a 38 inch chest size fits in a Medium. These Hanes Hoodies are 1 size away from the actual size. So if you're a Medium, order the small. They tend to fit on the baggy side as well. But I'm keeping it because it is comfortable and maybe sticking it a Commercial High Heat Laundry Mat dryer, it may shrink more because its 90% cotton, and 10% Polyester. Its heavy enough and warm enough, but if you really want a truly top of the line Hoodie, buy a Medium size Heavyweight Ralph Lauren $110.00 Hoodie from Macy's which I did. Fits like a glove and has  impeccable quaulity. I'll use the Hanes Hoodie to knock around in, and the Ralph Lauren Hoodie as a Jacket. For the price, it's an okay Hoodie."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Comfortable, well-constructed, roomy fit, happy purchase!",5,"This comfy zip-up hoodie has good weight but is  not too heavy. I like the fabric which is 90% cotton (other colors may have different fabric content). It’s difficult to find a high cotton content in fabrics these days. Ordered in black, the color is deep and rich. The size is exactly as specified in the chart, and the hood is round and roomy. The zipper is full-length and all-metal. There are two ample front pockets. What more could you ask for?"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Great quality and comfort at a great price!,5,"The fabric was really nice and cozy soft but feels very durable and breathable. The hardware detailing is really nice quality and the zipper is smooth and easy to engage. My 13 year old nephew hates anything itchy or distracting like labels and stiff seems or little pieces of pokey plastic thread and he absolutely loves it so that's a testament to it being very comfortable. He's an average sized slender 13 year old but he likes to wear hoodies in the largest size possible, so this fit the bill perfectly. I'm a short, fat grown person that normally wear a 1x-2x depending on the style, and these hoodies fit me loose and comfortable I could easily put them over another sweatshirt or sweater.I will definitely be buying more of these in other colors."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,looks and feels cheap,2,"This Hanes sweatshirt looks and feels super cheap!  I won't be wearing this sweatshirt, and certainly not in public.  I mainly wanted it to use indoors here in the Pacific NW, but it isn't even soft.  Every aspect of it screams ""cheap,"" from the material, to the design, to the ugly silver zipper.  I recommend the Gioberti instead.  Although I've only had the Gioberti for a few minutes (it came in the same package as the Hanes), it definitely is a heavy sweatshirt, and quite soft (so far).  The Gioberti looks a heckuva lot nicer than the Hanes, too.  Bye bye Hanes; you're going back to Amazon."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,great uniform sweater,4,"This is a great sweater for students to wear to school.  It's navy blue, so it's good for uniform.  This sweater is soft and comfortable, even if you aren't buying it as a uniform sweatshirt.  It's a great basic sweatshirt just to wear all the time.  It also washes well.  You can put it in the dryer, but I keep it out of the dryer in order ot avoid shrinking.  Instead, I just hang it up and let it dry on its own.  I don't know how much it would shrink in the dryer since I hang dry it, but sweatshirts are usually okay in the dryer, though it might shrink a bit.  This sweatshirt lasted some time, but then it tore and doesn't look nice anymore.The price is reasonable for a sweatshirt.I recommend this comfortable sweatshirt."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Different colors may have different cotton content,4,"I really like the Hanes Ultimate Hooded Sweatshirts, I have several colors.  They are warmer than most and have decent size pockets.  I noticed that different colors can have different cotton content, most seem to be 90% cotton, 10% polyester,  but some (usually grays) are 65% cotton, 35% polyester, and that starts getting that too artificial fiber / plastic / static cling feeling, especially if I am getting too warm.  Be careful, you cannot just roll over the different colors, you have to click on it to see the different cotton content.  I did buy a Navy blue Hanes Nano Hood that was 80-20, but it was not as warm and the hood was lined with lighter weight gray knit material.  The Ultimate hoods all seem to be lined with the same material and color as the sweatshirt.  The reason I gave this transaction only 4 stars is because when I ordered the Oxford Gray, the description said the content was 90%-10% but when I looked at the tags, it said 65%-35% and I had to return it.  Amazon was so great about easy returns that I decided to try the Charcoal Heather instead, and it came in 90%-10%, so I'm happy.  One comment about size - they seem a little big at first but after a few times through the washer and dryer, the Large seems to be just right!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Hanes 80% cotton hoodie falls apart  fast.,2,"All most FOUR month after getting this Hanes navy blue hoodie it allready started getting holes in the back of the shoulder and the color is fading by the cuff of one arm.This ""Ultimate  Hanes cotton"" printpro hoodie does not hold up well.I got this hoodie January 28th 2021 used it for a couple of month before it started fading. I did not use it in April because the weather was nice.Its now March 2021  and today it got little cold so grabbed this Hanes hoodie to use and found holes in the back of the shoulder. Well i owned it for 4 months but used it for 2 month and its falling apart.  Not what i would call high quality.Hanes hoodie is 90% cotton, 10%  polyester and falling apart.  Hanes made in Honduras.I have another navy blue hoodie made by another brand.its more than TEN years old. With 80% cotton, 20% polyester, its color is less faded and it has less holes in it.old hoodie made in the USA.Now that its summer and winter cloths are discounted i have replaced this HANES hoodie with ones from other brands and got some flannel. They should last much longer than hanes. Hanes hoodies  now rank much lower on my list. it was A comfortable hoodie but that's about all it was.  1 mayber 2 stars."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Love, love, love!",5,"I wasn't sure if I would like this jacket when I bought it..  I do not live where it is really cold, but this year has been weird and it has been cold.  I thought how heavy is heavy??  Well, this isn't that heavy... it is perfect to handle rain and the 40's fully zipped and to be in a chilly house that doesn't have the heat on.  It ended up being just perfect for what I needed.  I think it will also be perfect for when I visit my kids who live in places where is snows regularly... it is a perfect weight to handle a wide range of weather.  Below zero...maybe not... but ...hey, maybe if you are tougher than me!  Lol!  Not crazy about red, but you take what they have in your size....and hey, it has kind of grown on me!  =)"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Nice hoodie.,4,"Got a several to try out last winter, it was soft and thick with good overall quality.I like this brand and wear their boxer underwear for years....The fit was ok, the hood was a little big but it has laces to adjust it.In the end I discovered Under Armour and never looked back to another brand for hoodies/sweatshirts again, their materials are thin and retain heat so well.UA made me rate everything else lower as that is my new hoodie standard....4-stars !"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Meh... it's ok.,3,"I ordered 2 hoodies. One name brand (this one) and the other was an Amazon brand. I loved the Amazon brand. Soft and warm. Thus one was very stiff. Not soft at all, even on the inside. It's alright. But I wouldn't order again."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,False Advertising - BEWARE!,1,"Ordered  this hoodie and carefully checked to make sure the color I chose was 85% cotton / 15% polyester made by Hanes. What came instead was a 50% cotton / 50% polyester hoodie by Gildan. The hoodie is VERY lightweight with a cheap zipper. I don't expect the highest quality for such a low price, but the fact that this is advertised as ""heavyweight"" that it is made by Hanes and is an 85/15 blend is totally false advertising. Don't fall for it or you'll be going through the trouble of shipping it back or being disappointed."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Slight differences; but a good fit.,5,"Due to a prior purchase elsewhere of a Large Green Hanes Full Zip ""Ultimate Cotton Fleece Hoodie"" I decided to buy ""the same"" in Charcoal. The Green hoodie is 90% cotton and 10% polyester made in Honduras; the Charcoal hoodie is 65% cotton and 35% polyester and made in El Salvador. Both bear the same ""Ultimate"" tag; both fit nicely (I'm 6'1"" - 185lbs.), and the sleeves cover my wrists (34"" is my normal sleeve length). The extra polyester gives the hoodie a slightly lighter feel, but the construction seems solid and the hood is lined like my previous purchase. I'm just pointing out the differences that I noticed. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and I would buy it again."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"really thin, not that great",3,"If you are looking for a jacket, you will in fact receive a jacket, but it is not very quality. The material is very thin, it doesn't look well-made, and they fit really wide. I bought two of these, one for a friend and one for my dad, as useful gifts but I did not want to give these as gifts. Hane's has usually been a good brand for me but this item looked really cheap when I opened the packages and not like the picture."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Heavyweight, NOT !!!",2,"Advertised as heavyweight, NOT !!! It's very thin, more light a thick t-shirt with a hood. Buy at 2 sizes larger than what you need. Hanes is noted for running a wee bit on the small side, for this reason, I only went up one size. This was fine at first, until I had washed it ( it cold water, and even lined dry it ) and it shrunk another size down. Ended up giving it to my daughter in law for when they go camping to sit around  the fire pit on a cool night."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,It's a black hoodie sweatshirt,4,"My husband needs a inexpensive black hoodie zip sweatshirt for work. It's been surprisingly hard to find one in his size. He didn't want to spend more than $25 for a hoodie that will get get stained at work.This has a high cotton content so even washing it in cold water then drying in dryer set to shut off when it detects laundry is dry the hoodie shank enough for the zipper to wrap. Also, while heavy duty metal, the zipper feels cheap to me. It looks like bright aluminum  in color too."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Good Sweatshirt, Way Too Big. Thus 2 stars. Update to 4 stars.",4,"This rating is about sizing = 2 stars.  Otherwise  4 or 5 stars.  The hoodie is fine.  Good material, good color.I used the Hanes sizing chart linked to the product and selected a Large (I am 6 ft tall with 44"" chest).  The Large is at least one full size too big for me.  Waist band comes to below mid-thigh, nearly to knees.  Sleeves 3 inches too long.  Might use it over other bulky warm clothing but probably should return it and get a medium.  If you get one that fits, all good.Update- Returned to Amazon, no problem.  Purchased the medium as replacement = fits fine.  Therefore have increased rating to 4 stars (not 5; because I had to return the large)."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Looks & Fits great!,5,"This product was as good as expected!It fits just right and even after washing, it looks great! It didn’t shrink or get distorted like some products do. Good quality for a good price!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Soft and warm but poorly stitched and hood is way too small.,2,"I'll start with the positive first, this hoodie is soft and warm, I really like the material it is made from.  The color is very nice and hasn't faded after a few washes.The negative is the cut and sewing of the material are pretty terrible.  The hood portion is very shallow, it barely covers my ears, leaving a large portion of my head exposed.  It is cut so small that when the hood is up and I pull the draw strings, it lifts the rest of the hood up toward my chin rather than drawing the hood down.  Everything about the hood is poor.The arms were also a bit short, but I attribute that more to poor seam stitching rather than material used.  When I extend my arms the material ""bunches"" up, but the length of the seam is straight and taught.  If it was stitched better I think the length of the arms would not be as big of an issue.  Those issues I determined before I had washed the first time so it was not because of poor choices in the laundry room causing shrinkage.Additionally, after two washes some of the stitching is coming apart, mostly at the wrists from the previously mentioned poor stitching.  I had to mend it so it didn't completely come apart."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,An at home lounging hoodie,3,"It’s okay. The material feels a little rough. I just wanted a baggy sweatshirt hoodie to wear around the house during this fall (I’m a girl and purposely bought myself a men’s hoodie to make up for my husbands that I stole from him and lost last year ha) and winter and this will do the job. I hope it softens up in the wash bec it really is a little rough for a hoodie. It’s definitely on the big side (I wanted it to be big, but it’s bigger than a normal men’s large I would say)."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Great medium weight sweatshirt,5,"Hanes sweatshirts are the best!  I have them in a variety of colors.  This one is 90% cotton, 10% poly, which I prefer to 50/50.  It was a couple of dollars more than 50/50 but still extremely reasonable in price.  One of the best things about this item is that the zipper is metal.  Metal zippers are much more durable, but sometimes hard to find.  100% satisfied with this purchase, which has both a great look and feel.  Truly a quality item."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Comfortable and p good,4,"I would like to start off by saying I am a 5'7 female who purchased a size medium. The size medium is definitely oversized, and the sleeves go past my fingers. I do like the material, but it does get a little rough after a few washes as expected. Overall, it's a decent jacket I don't really have complaints. However, beware washing it on high heat or using the dryer. It will shrink a lot especially if u stick it in the dryer. It is not preshrunk so please be aware. I had to repurchase it because it shrunk.That is my only complain about this product. This company should not advertise it as ""machine wash"" if it literally shrinks in the machine."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Seems like a decent product.,4,"The product was 90% cotton and 10% polyester for the forest green.  Color was darker than I expected but that's not a real big deal.  It is a little heavier than I thought and so won't repel water as well as a lighter product.  So okay, what did I expect?  It's a hoodie with a zipper.  Most of my hoodies become useless due to the zipper failing.  This one seems to have a decent zipper so I hope it holds up.  Other than that it seems to fit okay but let's face it, it i didn't buy it to be a fashion accessory.  I'm more of a functional kind of animal  and I think it will work."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"An actual review, not just a quick opinion",4,"If you are like me and are in that size range between small and medium then know that I rolled the dice and chose small when i ordered this. It fits like a decent medium. A little bit baggy when i expected a pretty form fit so that I could wear a jacket over it. I am still satisfied in this regard because it still works, but that was my original intention when ordering this sweater. I am curious how big the medium is. It has heavy duty fabric. Not soft or fuzzy feeling like a typical sweatshirt, at least pre wash. I expect it will soften up over time. I am satisfied because i wanted a heavier duty fabric. As i put it on I smelled a rather cheap perfume type smell and it appears localized on area. This sweater was definitely spritzed with some kind of perfume or fabreeze and so i do not like that. I am forced to wash it; no getting away with wearing it immediately. That is my only real complaint. The sizes appear to run large, so consider that when purchasing."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,GET YOUR TERMINOLOGY RIGHT!  FLEECE VS FLANNEL,5,"I gave the product 5 stars because it is lined and it is heavy weight.  BUT the description of the product is not right .... it is the following: ""a heavy weight cotton, sweatshirt material, with a FLANNEL lining in the body and no lining in the hood.""There is a big difference between flannel and fleece ... the terms are not inter-changeable. FLANNEL is a soft woven fabric, used in linings and shirts:  FLEECE is a soft polyester fuzzy fabric.  This has no fuzz and is definitely flannel lining. The product is good quality and heavyweight but the terms are miss leading.  [PHOTO IN BLUE = FLANNEL  PHOTO IN BROWN = FLEECE]"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Nice,heavy Sweatshirt",5,"Bought one of these hoodies in black($10.99) for my Husband. He LOVES IT!!  It is very thick, cozy, and well made. Hubby is very picky about things being ""pure cotton"" and even HE approved this 90/10 cotton blend. Amazing! The fit IS a bit big- got him a Large- and it allows lots of room for layering. However, it IS a jacket and meant to be worn over other shirts, sweaters, etc. My only complaint is that the very same hoodie in RED or Navy Blue or Green costs  $24? $26? WHY??? This feels like a cheap and tacky tactic by the Seller. For this reason-I will NOT be doing any other business with this Seller."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Great red hoodie :),5,"To start off, I love this sweatshirt. I'm female but when it comes to zip up hoodies I don't really feel like there's much of a difference. My only issue with this was that I ordered it first in what my ""normal"" women's size is - XL - and it was *huge*. I was wary to skip right to a M because I like them to have a little room, so I exchanged for the L. The L would have been a good sweatshirt for lounging around the house in for me, I wasn't drowning in it. But I wanted one to wear out, so I exchanged again for the M. It fits just like I wanted it to, the material isn't thin or flimsy and it's warm, and comfortable for me to wear under my winter jacket. The color is exactly what I expected it to be from the pictures. Ultimately, I'm super happy with it, but we'll see how it holds up after washing it, and also time in general. If anything major happens I'll update my review. Just remember, if you're a woman, I would recommend sizing down 2 sizes from your normal women's size!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Well made jacket of a thick heavy cotton,5,This is a very nice hooded sweatshirt jacket. At 90% cotton it’s much thicker and warmer than the jackets that are at a 50/50 cotton. It’s well made with no loose stitches anywhere. The zipper is of all metal parts which I’ve found makes it less likely to malfunction than plastic zippers. It runs large but I don’t mind that at all as I like my jackets to be oversized. I’m very pleased with this item and recommend it to others.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Great buy!! Favorite hoodie,5,"I’m 5’5” 125lbs female. I ordered a small. I wanted a baggy but thick material hoodie for the fall/winter time and this was perfect! I couldn’t decide between medium and small at first, because I’m usually either size depending on the brand... small was perfect, it was very baggy but without making me look weird. Also the material? I was honestly kind of shocked... really good quality and yes very heavy weight but also soft and light enough for everyday activity. 90% cotton and 10% polyester on tag. Great buy!!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Fits As Expected For Female,5,"I'm 5' 5"" and weigh about 115 lbs.I like my clothes to be loose and a little long on me. The small fit perfectly, and I'm glad I didn't get anything bigger. When I raise my arms up, my torso is still covered. The sleeves are a bit long, but I was expecting that since this is a men's hoodie. I'm fairly used to rolling up my sleeves, so this isn't an issue for me. I will be buying more soon."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,You get what you pay for,1,"As the saying gos you get what you pay for.  The price was very cheap compared to others which is why the quality was not that good.  it felt very rough and not comfortable.  In addition to this it was larger then normal.  I bought an Xl size and it felt like a 2xl especially from the sleeves.  I guess this would be a good sweater if you are using it for work and you work in construction, machine shop, yard work but not as a daily wear."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Not a heavyweight hoodie,3,"This is not a heavyweight hoodie I expected and need for our New Hampshire winters.  It doesn’t weigh much, and the thin fleece alone doesn’t make it a warm hoodie.  The zipper has sharp edges as mentioned in other reviews.  The hood pull strings are way too long even when the hood is fully opened, and get in the way all the time.  It would be a great hoodie for warmer climates, but deserves only 3-stars for not being heavyweight.  Amazing: the Rate Features section asked for a rating on Light Weight -huh?- not Heavyweight, so I had to rate that as 5-star.  Disappointed."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Also doesn't look like a modern hanes sweatshirt,1,"It says that it's tagless right in the description,  but it's not tagless. Also doesn't look like a modern hanes sweatshirt. Certainly doesn't look used, but it was definetly made in the 1990s. The modern ones are tagless, and the logo is different.  Definitely old."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,high quality,5,"I purchased this hoodie a few weeks ago;  I love it.  The material is of very good quality and the product is well made.  Also, I love the maroon color.Since I live in Southern California, I can't attest to it's warmth in cold climates, but when we hit my idea of cold weather (40s and 50s) it's been great.I chose to get a slightly larger size (XL) in case the large was a tight fit. In retrospect, maybe I should have gotten the large, but when shopping online, you can't try it on.  Amazon has excellent return policies, but in this case, I didn't bother...big and warm suits me just fine.Oh, and just because I'm a 60 something female doesn't mean that this is just for older ladies.  It just means that older ladies recognize quality when they see it.cb"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Useful Bargain,4,This fleece was a useful bargain.  Try to get the ones that are 90% cotton.  Mine is dark green and has the high cotton content.  Some people did not like their orders and it may have been because the ones they got had a higher amount of polyester in the material.  This is not heavyweight.  I washed it.  It is not particularly soft.  I wear a size 16 American size shirt and the fit was good.  I ordered a large sized fleece.  It comes to about two inches below the bottom of my belt loops.  That seems the correct length to me.  It is light weight and good for cool if not cold weather.  The price was good.  I recommend the one with the zipper.  That helps to prevent overheating and you do not have to take it off to cool down.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,This is the hoodie!,5,Oh boy is this the hoodie. Perfect fit very warm very comfortable.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,It’ll do,2,"I made a point of reading the reviews. I should have listened. This runs very small. With the reviews in mind, I bought the biggest size available; 5X. I was hoping it would be “oversized” like other jackets I’ve bought at 4X. *Wrong.*  It fits more like a 2X, maybe 3X. This runs VERY small. I am ‘top heavy’ and it fits a bit snug across the chest. It is just for casual, workout wear so I’m not over-annoyed. I just wish it fit better.Also, it is NOT REMOTELY heavy weight. Medium if I’m being generous.Very disappointed w HANES."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,I'm happy in every way,5,"Long story short, I wanted a simple, high quality, generic black hoodie for me and my fiancée, at a reasonable price from one of these major men's clothing manufacturers, and that's just what I got. I'm happy in every way. Word to the wise: I almost bought what would have been a much thinner cloth version from the same company Hanes, for the same price. Luckily, I caught it, and found this thicker version, which looks and feels like quality, and I'm sure will be much warmer, too. Why buy a thin jacket, you know?  The sizing was as expected. I am normally a 4x, but I got 3x only because it was difficult to find one in black on the website, which is screwy in that some colors in my 4x size cost a lot more or are out of stock. Turns out as I expected, it fits fine, as hoodies and jackets in general are cut a  bit larger. I plan to just let it tumble in the dryer for only 10 minutes or less on a low setting, then let it air dry, to reduce shrinking. But I don't think it will shrink much anyway, the way the fabric feels tightly woven."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,NOT a fleece jacket - Very misleading item title,1,"Do you know standard athletic sweatpants and sweatshirt material? That's what this is.. This is NOT a fleece jacket in any way. I was so disappointed when I received it, I could tell right away, the package was very thin for a 3XL ""Fleece"" Jacket. Maybe 1.5"" high, folded in 1/2. I didn't even bother opening it and trying it.. Went right back out to Amazon.. Buyers beware."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Woman Buying Man's Jacket,4,"I, like most women in the reviews, ordered this because it's so hard sometimes to find a good woman's jacket like this. All the ones I could find were too thin, so I was pleased to find this one. I'm 5'5"" 152 lbs and ordered the small of course. It's a bit big on me but that was to be expected since I'm obviously not a dude and women are built differently. It's comfy though and simple so I like it a lot."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Nice garment...poor draw string,4,"Like the hoody.  Hate the pull string for the hood.  Fabric and zipper quality are good.  I find that it fit me a little larger than some others, but that may more be a comment on the other brands cutting corners than this one being over sized.My one complaint is that the draw string has a relatively loosely woven sheathing that gets caught in the zipper and threads pull out.  It looks ratty, and as threads pull out they become more likely to get captured in the zipper and aggravates the problem.  I often wear it as a layer under another jacket, and the strings also catch in the zipper of that jacket."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Nice hoodie but the printed tag is horrible.,2,"Nice hoodie, a bit on the thicker side, the fabric is soft and didn’t pill when I washed it. I removed 3 stars because the printed tag bothers my husband and every time he wears the hoodie he gets a rash on his neck where the tag touches his skin, so he has to wear a teeshirt that has a collar or a scarf as a protection. You would think a good company like Hanes would use regular fabric tags that are not sewn near the skin, but instead they use these stupid printed plastic tags that irritate the skin. This is disappointing to say the least. Why do companies put plastic everywhere? I hate these tags too..."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,was Great,2,"Nice material, metal zipper? I've been looking for a metal zipper and now have one. I'm buying more.THE PROBLEM NOW THAT i HAVE HAD THIS SINCE OCTOBER... The zipper broke. I don't think it possible to get ANYTHING with a zipper that will hold up for the life of the material it's put on. ALL zippers are unreliable.I really like this hoodie, with the exception I CAN'T ZIP IT UP!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Wide body, tiny pockets",3,"It is well-made. The stitching is very even.  The sleeves are a good length. The body is about 6 inches too wide. The pockets are so small that I can only fit 2/3rds of my hands in them. I'm afraid anything I put in the pockets would fall out. The fabric is kind of rough, but I suppose it will soften over time. After a few washings, I will decide whether to keep it or give it away to a fat man with long arms & tiny hands."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,pristine in package,5,"This was a gift along with another in a different color.  It arrived pristine in unopened package.  However the other one arrived ""tried on"" obviously with small pieces of fuzz and hair.  I won't be ordering anything that say's ""7 day prime because it can be worn and sent back causing embarrassment to the gifter.  Please stop this program or maybe make it two days.  Unfortunately Christmas is going to be iffy trying on clothing and then sending it back possibly worn in between that 7 day window.  No Thanks.............................................................."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Oversized but otherwise great,4,"I ordered a size medium because I have another Hanes men’s medium jacket/hoodie and it fits perfectly, but for this I should of gotten a small. Definitely not 38-40” chest, this is more like 45.” I’m 5’10” / 117 lbs for reference in the picture showing how big it is on me. Other than that though the inside is very soft synthetic fleece and the outside if thick cotton which I love. The zipper and strings are good too and the hood isn’t small, I’ll get a lot of wear out of this in school (all my classes are AC). Just size down from your usual size!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,You get what you paid for.,3,"Good hoodie for the price, but I would not call it heavyweight. It got a little stiff after the first wash, but after wearing it  for a little while, it softened back up.The fleece on the inside lasted the first wash, but I'm not sure how many it can handle before pilling. Definitely not the best hoodie I've owned, and I'm sure more expensive ones are better quality. This is my lounge hoodie, I use it over scrubs at work mostly, and under a windbreaker when I walk the dogs. It is good for layering, but would not stand on its own."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Great Heavy Hoodie,5,The hoodie is soft enough without being too soft if you k ow what I mean. It’s not super heavy but it’s heavy enough for me and I’m 200 lbs. This winter has been in the 20s and 30s here and this hoodie keeps my warm and content with a beanie of course. Washed it a few times and the color has held up along with the stitching. Will be purchasing another in royal blue soon.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Warm, comfortable, and sturdy.",5,"Initially it fit bigger than I expected. Not outrageously so, but I did consider returning it. I kept it, though, and eventually found that after its first washing it had shrunk down to a perfect fit. It's comfortable in cooler temperatures, but a bit too heavy when it's warmer. It is called a heavyweight fleece after all, so no complaints there. I often wear it in perfect comfort for hours on end in a refrigerated environment.It seems fairly durable as well, as it has snagged several times on metal without tearing, and was completely undamaged after a nasty fall on rough concrete that left me with bloody elbows."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"MUCH too large, too short, and defnitely NOT heavyweight as they claim!!",1,"I dunno, if they're just going down in quality or someone, is selling fakes but these are the cheapest hoodies I've ever seen! They're not much thicker than a t-shirt and they claim that is a heavyweight! What... Then this thing looks like a circus tent it's so big but it's extremely short too. This is the worst piece of clothing I've ever seen."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Fall Jacket,5,"I got this for my Dad as this is the same exact one that I always use and love. It's not heavyweight enough for extreme winter days, but it is good for weather in the 40's and above. As long as you are not outside for an extended period of time."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Utilitarian garment chock full of utility at a reasonable price,4,This is a hoodie.  It's a sweatshirt with a zipper and a hood.  It's not a designer garment and it's not for sub zero wear.  It's decently made.  The seams and the zipper are good.  The drawstrings work properly.  It's what I wanted for things like walking the dog or going to the store when the temperature is in the 40 to 60 range.  It was inexpensive too.  I like it.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,fantastic price,5,"I get compliments at work since I started wearing it. Impressive for 14 dollars. I was expecting less quality but was highly surprised. Ironically I saw the same zipper hoodie at Target for 34 dollars. Did not realize I got the same one until I saw the label. Amazon and Hanes did well on this one.  Only wish it had an inside pocket, but hey, it was 14 bucks."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Nice and snuggly,5,"I ordered this hoodie in red because I liked the color.  It is really a nice , true red.  It fits very big on me but that was what I wanted.  I normally get women's clothing but in this case, the men's XL is perfect.  It is longer than the ladies hoodie and that is what I wanted.  It seems to be well made and hopefully it will not peel up after lots of wear and washing."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Cotton, basic, but a little short.",4,"Bought for my husband, who loves it. I didn’t even get a chance to wash it 🙄.However, I bought him a Large, (which is usually just slightly loose on him, comfortable fit) and though it fits, it fits baggy, it’s a little on the short side and looks like it’s made wider than I would like for his thin frame (the bottom band is way wider than his hips and it does not fit him proper like the picture).It is definitely 100% cotton! If it does okay through the wash, I may just try a smaller size and review again."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Not a Heavyweight,2,This hoodie sweatshirt is definitely not a heavyweight.  It could easily pass for a lightweight hoodie as the 2 that I recently purchased. There is plenty of room for added insulation as this sweatshirt is huge as well. It might fit better once washed but I won't be keeping it that long. Overall a disappointment.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"War, Heavy, and Generously Sized",4,"In a world where everything seems to be shrinking - from airline seats to clothes - Hanes surprised me. Their 3X hoodie is actually 3X... and maybe 3.25X. This hoodie is generously sized and heavier than I expected. It seems to be very well made, too. My initial reaction is this was a very good buy."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,This is a lightweight and not heavyweight sweatshirt.,1,I attempted to initiate a return of this item that I paid 16.50 explaining how this is not what is advertised.  It is a light weight sweatshirt and NOT a heavyweight sweatshirt.  I got up to the place where I should confirm that I wish tor return the item---to my shock the amount that was proposed as a refund was 7.12.  Something is very wrong!!!!!
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Nice, but way too large for the size I ordered",5,"I ordered a men's medium, which I wear in T-shirts and other hoodies. My husband is a large. The M was like an XL on him. I am returning it because I suspect the S will be too large as well. But it is a bright red, which I like, and the quality of the material is excellent. I wish the sizing was true to typical men's sizing."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Not heavyweight at all,2,"I have a nice fleece lined heavyweight hoody and wanted to get one in a different color. I was very disappointed in the one I ordered from Amazon as it isn't heavyweight and if this is what they consider ""fleece lined"" then they clearly have a different definition of that term. Otherwise it's a very nice standard type hoody but it doesn't provide the warmth of a real fleece lined hoody."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Good for the Price,3,"For this price this hoodie is great (I purchased it for $10 and change in 2019). It's a good utility hoody for around the house or yardwork. Material isn't as thick as I thought it would be, it says heavyweight but it feels like the same weight material of any normal hoodie. It's also cut unflatteringly and fits like a big garbage bag. Full disclosure, I ordered the XXL and I guess it fits like a standard loose XXL but not like any athletic or slim fit. I am 5'10"" 250 lbs with a large chest and I normally wear XL to XXL shirts."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Great lightweight jacket for the price.,5,"I needed a new jacket that looked nice and was a good price, this fit the description. I was not expecting to much because of the price but I was happily surprised. The jacket looks great and was the exact size for me, also it has a nice built in lining that is very warm for a lightweight jacket. Definitely a great buy for the price!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Eh.,3,I ordered the green in a 2XL because I like my hoodies baggy. I didn’t receive what was pictured. It was supposed to have a Sherpa lining. This was just your average Wally World hoodie. Decided to keep it anyway but after washing it shrunk a ton length wise. Before washing it covered my rear. Now it’s at my waist. However width wise it stayed the same. So now it looks super funky. Would not recommend.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Warm and heavy duty hoodie,5,I am about 5’7”/ 135lbs and female. A SMALL men’s size fit perfect after a couple wash & drys. This is a more heavy duty hoodie than a women’s. Not really a fashion item but warm and cozy for camping or yard work.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,LOVE IT!,5,"I am a very tall woman and I love my hoodies to be somewhat larger. It's hard to find women hoodies that way. I saw this in the men's section an thought, let me give it a shot. First of all I love Hanes clothes to begin with, when I got this the first thing I thought...""I LOVE the color!"" I opened it up and it was very soft and durable!! It's a thicker hoodie. I bought this color because I thought it was more feminine. I showed to some of my friends and they thought it was really nice. I would definitely recommend it to us girls who are close to 6 ft and like a bigger fit."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Runs big.,5,"Very warm, soft, and comfortable. It has really helped me get through this last winter. However, anyone purchasing should know that the sizing is very big. I'm 6' and 175 lbs. I ordered a large and I'm swimming in it. Great for lounging around the house but I probably wouldn't wear it as part of an outfit."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Not as heavy as I was hoping...,3,"It's a light weight jacket/hoodie. Good quality material. Doesn't feel cheap or chintzy. It's not really thin just light weight. Good for layering. Over a heavy shirt, under a jean jacket, or something similar. Good price for what you get. Haven't washed it yet so I can't comment on how it holds up in the wash."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,returned,2,"bought a size M. im 5'8"", 147 punds. this is not a slender hoodie. it showed up and looked like a large or even XL. even if i washed this hoodie this is not  a medium and would never fit me, the sleve holes are massive and wold fit my legs. its extremely wide and the zipper would buckle like crazy if it shrank. I ordered a GILD*N hoodie in a medium adn its perfect."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Definitely not heavyweight fleece.  It's an ugly, big, baggy, shapeless crap.",1,"Definitely not heavyweight fleece.  Not even fleece.  The description of the product is incorrect.  It is too big in body but sleeves are right length.  I bought it for my husband.  He is keeping it because he just doesn't care.  I think it is too big and I wouldn't keep it for myself.  It's an ugly, big, baggy, shapeless crap.  But he wants to keep it."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Heavyweight Is Optimistic,4,"Don't get me wrong, I do like the jacket, but it's not what I would call heavyweight. It's more of a medium weight. It certainly doesn't do a great job of keeping the wind out. All this said, the metal zipper, roomy pockets, nice hood, and other features do make it a worthwhile purchase. I'd say it's a good value for the money spent. Just don't think that it's going to keep you warm on a windy day or damp day without some additional undergarment or a sweatshirt."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Comfy, Soft, Long Sleeves",4,"I wear hoodies year round and it was time for a new one. This one is very casual as expected from Hanes.It is a little on the loose side and it is a little long in the arms for me at 5'6"", so I do have to roll up the sleeves once.Super soft and super comfortable though, I'm sure I will be wearing this one for lounging around the house and working from home for years to come."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,It is thicker than a woman's sweater.,5,"I bought this specifically because it was for males because I have learned that male clothes tend to be thicker than women's. This sweater is really warm, perfect for the weather around 65+ F. I don't know if it is because I have a big head (haha), but the hood sits a bit behind my forehead. It does go past my hairline though. Overall, it is really comfortable. The insides are not as soft as it used to be, but the thickness is still the same."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Well worth my money!!!! Love Hanes!!!!!,5,"I like this jacket, I ordered big so it would be baggy (it's a 90s thing.) I bought this jacket at first to replace an old favorite jacket that I had for about 4 years. I feel that this jacket is a lot better, not only is it long enough for me but it's comfortable and the main concern with my last jacket was the zipper, the zipper seems incredibly durable on this jacket and I feel Hanes hasn't ever let me down. I've bought socks, shirts and even jammie pants by Hanes, your clothes are so comfy!!!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Decent affordable hoodie.,4,"Decent quality hoodie, for me it was not padded enough as I was looking for something to wear during winter.I didn't see any visible defects and it fit me all right.In the end it was a return as part of Wardrobe then I went with UA instead.4-stars !"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Soft and comfortable.  Ample and not too heavy.,4,"I am a woman, 5’3”, 128 lbs. It is a bit large on me but that was anticipated.  I use hoodies for very casual wear, like walking dogs, working outside, etc.  I intend to layer as needed when wearing it.  Love the color and the weight of the garment.  Appears to be good quality and the zipper is metal - yay!  I have had too many flimsy hoodies with plastic zippers that break."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Proper fitting. Very nice material and comfort. All important to me when buying clothing.,5,These Hanes Hoodies with the zipper are surprisingly high quality for the low price.  Mine fits perfectly.  The hood is the right size and the material is cozy.  I am happy with my purchase.  And it arrived via Amazon logistics the day after I placed the order.  Amazon is adapting well to the challenge of our current pandemic.  Thank you.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,NOT a heavyweight as described on website,1,"Not a heavy weight ""Ultimate"" as stated in website.  Feels no different than the Hanes lightweight and I paid more for the Ultimate for its thickness.After the first wash, the drawstring plastic end cap came off in the wash.Now I'm stuck with a lightweight jacket and  a bad drawstring.*** Won't buy again ***"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,The Fleece Factor,5,"Comfort and Insulation: This fleece jacket feels soft on the skin, while keeping one warm, without feeling too heavy. It is reasonably light.Fit: This fits perfectly well for a 5'11"" male, weighing 165 lb -170 lb.Durability: It has survived a few washes without any sign of wear, so I foresee this jacket to last at least an year or more.When one factors in the price, this is an absolute must-have!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Great product! Worth the money.,5,"Honestly, to me it runs on the large size but I might have ordered a size up since most things run small and because I will wear it over other things.It is well made same nice material and I would definitely but it again. As to warmth, it's light weight was it says but great for chilly mornings/evenings."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Great for Senior Citizens!,5,My father is not as young as he once was and is now cold more often than not.  I decided to get him this awesome hooded sweatshirt so that he would be more comfortable.  Everything about this sweatshirt brought my father great joy.  I got it for him in his favorite color and the fact that it has a zipper and is not a pullover makes it easier for a man with stiff elderly joints to get in and out of it.  My father was so appreciative of it that he wrote my other siblings out of his will.  Sole inheritance baby!
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Just another cheap basic hoodie doesn't last very long,3,This coat is a little baggy at the bottom. It looks good the 1st time you wear it but after it's washed it's never the same.  I just wish it felt as good as the 1st time you wear it I don't get why washing it has to create so many piles and make it look so worn out so fast
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Great hoodie for the price,4,"This is a pretty good heavyweight hoodie, it fits good and roomy, keeps you warm.  My only gripe is that the zipper doesn't go all the way up to the neck of the jacket, there seems to be about a quarter inch gap from the top when zipped all the way up.  Other than that this seems to be a good jacket for the money."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Hard to find zippered hoodies,5,"and I love Gildan! always so soft.  I ordered XL Men's because I have broader shoulders, and they fit a little looser.  I washed this hoodie right away.  Softened up, and fits a bit bigger, but I figure I'll be wearing thicker clothes in a month or two when needed.  :)  All-in-all, I'd say it's perfect!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,sooo comfy! (DO NOT DRY),5,"I got this to be a cute over-sized zip-up to pair with my outfits. I am usually a women's M/L and since this is men's and I wanted over-sized, I went with an L. It is very big but just the look I wanted. It is so comfortable and cute and I would definitely repurchase in other colors.But, when I accidentally stuck it in the dryer, IT SHRUNK SO MUCH I had to order a replacement. So, just be sure to hang dry."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,I bought a ton of Hanes products this month expecting something like what I remember getting 15 or so years ago,3,"Not ultimate, not thick, not warm, runs small, not stretchy at all... I bought a ton of Hanes products this month expecting something like what I remember getting 15 or so years ago. Utterly bummed. I could have gotten something off-brand at a corner store for less than half the price for about the same quality. What happened to you, Hanes?2.5/5 but giving three for lack of half-starsPS: Amazon can we have a 1-10 rating system or at least be allowed half-stars? 3 is too neutral and 2 seems mean/too negative... and 4 is usually too close to a five for mildly pleased when five stars should really mean just about perfect. A twenty-year pet peeve. Ugh."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,arms are enormous,3,"For some reason there is way too much width provided for the arms in proportion to the rest of the garment. It bunches up in a really awkward way around the armpit area because of all the extra fabric. The torso portion seems right in terms of size, but the arms are far too baggy."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Comfortable and well crafted.,5,"A most comfortable and snuggly hoodie. The weight is good, and it is quite warm. Minor problems working the zipper over the pocket area, but this could be due to it not being broken in yet. I give it plus points for having a metal zipper. Regardless, fits well, and the hood goes over the head, yet does not plop down over the face, as many of these things do. Good fit, well manufactured, you won't go wrong with this one."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,what of got 5 stars if it was more  of a sheep like cozy feel,4,product is heavy fitting  as it says . goes on cold and seems to stay cold.  keep in mind my home is 50 degrees at this time. not the cozy  quick warm sweater i was looking for. but good price and i have not tested it. so maybe as i wear it . i will warm up  .Nice comfortable fit .
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Runs Huge,1,I got one of these in a medium for my husband and it looked like an extra large on him.  He is not a real big guy so medium seems to work great for him for sweatshirts & sweaters but this was super disappointing. So it is definitely going back.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Don't waste your money,1,It feels like a bunch of mismatched pieces were put together to make this.  It's super large in the body yet if you wear the hood it pushes down on your head to the point where you get a neck cramp if you wear it too long.  Cheap garbage that's not at all worth wasting your money on.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,So comfy!,5,"I hate big puffy winter jackets, but I needed a new hoodie to keep me warm this winter.  This fit the bill perfectly - it's thick, soft, feels like it's good quality, and fits a little loose, which I love.  Not too big, just a little bit more room.  Best of all, it's warm and has nice, deep pockets to store my gloves in when I hang it up.  I got the navy blue color and it's accurate to the picture, too.  If you want a comfy winter hoodie for a good price, I'd definitely recommend this."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"This hoodie fits great, with a little bit of room for layering",5,"XL Regular. I'm 6'0"" 230 lbs. This hoodie fits great, with a little bit of room for layering. Put it through the wash (warm water) and the dryer (low heat), and it came out just fine, no shrinking, fading or fraying. I'm thoroughly pleased, especially at the price. I'm going to buy more."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Good basic zip sweat shirt,5,My husband and son wear them every day. They are vastly different in size. 5’10 and 210lbs. He like baggy xxl. My son is 5’1” and 150lbs and likes a baggy xl. Just a basic mid weight zip sweat shirt. It’s the one you grab when you are running around and don’t want a coat.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Not really a heavy weight hoodie.,3,"I was looking for a heavy weight hoodie that I could wear under my windbreaker. These are not actually heavy weight. The cheap ones at Walmart are just as heavy. These are, however, very nice quality and very comfortable. It was not what I was looking for, so back it went."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Most likely a counterfeit Haynes,3,"The sleeve fabric is severely ""bunched"" where sewn to ribbing at the wrist.  If this is not a counterfeit then Haynes quality control is asleep at the wheel.  But I paid $16.50 so no complaints: what else should you expect when you pay such a low ""counterfeit price."""
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Good for $10,4,"It's labeled 90% cotton, but the outside feels more like 100% polyester even after washing.  Since this is about half the price of what it would cost on the Hanes site, it makes me wonder if it's really 90% cotton.The size seems right after washing.  It's a decent weight.  The zipper rolls a little and is hard to engage at first, but works OK.  I'd definitely buy again for $10."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Nice quality, low price",5,"This is way more of a heavy-duty sweatshirt than I was expecting, especially for the price!  I'll probably be buying more for my hubby.  I bought this one, a men's medium, for myself to wear around the house with my jammies.  I love it.  It's well worth the price and fits as expected (too large for my smaller frame, which is exactly what I was going for).  Definitely recommend."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,One shrunk down to the perfect size. The other shrunk down to almost a ...,4,"These things seem to shrink in odd ways after washing and drying them a few times.I purchased two of them.  One shrunk down to the perfect size.  The other shrunk down to almost a full size smaller than I purchased it as.It's really odd, but aside from the odd shrinking issue these are really nice and comfortable hoodies."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Great Hoodie, glad I got it",5,This jacket is a little thicker than so many fleece jackets. I love it! I generally wear XXL shirts so I ordered the XXL jacket. It fits slightly loose but that's far better than slightly tight. I am very happy I did not order the XL size.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Quality!,5,"I ordered an XL for me and a large for my man, we each could have gone down a size. We don't care though, the hoodies are really good quality and should last indefinitely and also, they were $13 and $10.50. Can't beat that, not from where we come from."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,This coat made me a hero!,5,"Gave this to my son-in-law for Christmas.  He needed a extra warm coat but hates the bulky heavy ones that are difficult to move in.  This coat checked all the boxes for what he needed.  It is lightweight yet gives him the warmth he was looking for, easy to clean, well constructed, and very easy to move in without feeling constricted."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Good quality at a decent price, A good fitting hoodie made with COTTON!",5,"Trying to find a basic, good quality, decent fitting, cotton hoodie is nearly impossible. I bought this as a back up for another lower quality hoodie, and find that I wear this one now, as it is cotton, durable, well fitting, and not short in sleeves or torso, for an average/full build, and the price was soooo reasonable at a $10.99/special price.  Would purchase again!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,kid actually liked it.,5,"Bought this for my oldest grandson(17). He really likes it and actually said he would like another. He's 6'2"" and said it was the right length in the sleeves and body. Yea Grandma!! I bought the medium for 2nd grandson(14) and the small for 3rd grandson(12). They all were actually pleased with them and the fit. 2nd is about 5'10"" and 3rd  is 5'5""."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Looked very cheap,1,"When I put this hoodie on me, it looked like I was wearing a 10 year old hoodie that I had work every day for 10 years. It looked and felt very cheap. Had to put it back in it's package and drive up to the ups store to return it promptly. I'm going to Gap or Target. I believe they have polyester and cotton blend hoodies that look like a million bucks."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,All these Adjectives,2,"I bought these zip up hoodies to embroider for work. They certainly do have plenty of adjectives, the only thing is they don't really apply. These hoodies did have a metal zipper, but they were thin. Thin like one your grandma would wear inside, not like a ultimate heavy duty one that would be worn outside for work. Maybe a more realistic description would go a long way."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Quality!,5,"This is definitely thicker than most Hanes hoodies. I just wear them around my house when it's chilly, but this is thick and comfy. I could easily wear this outdoors camping, working or whatever. It's a quality sweater for sure. It just arrived-haven't washed it yet. The pockets are shallow, btw. My cell phone falls out when I bend down."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Pockets are too small,4,I like generous sleeve length.  I like the heavier weight cotton.  Zipper works great.  BAD: Pockets far too small to safely carry a pair of eye glasses and certainly not a smart phone.  Full sized pockets might have cost the company 5 cents more - nutty oversight on their part.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Great Hoodie, But Dryer Beware",4,"Standing at over 6 feet and under 200 pounds, when this hoodie arrived it was a little baggy.  After a wash/dry, it shrunk down to my fit.  I would not put it in a dryer a second time however, as it may shrink to be too small.  I’ve been, and would recommend, air drying it in order to maintain its size.  Otherwise, the color is great and it’s plenty warm."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Comfy!,5,"5’8”, ~135-140 lbs, I usually wear men’s size small but I ordered a medium because I wanted it baggy. Fits exactly how I wanted! Nice and thicc to keep you warm, I’m definitely gonna be using this this winter. I mean, yeah, it definitely is a cotton jacket, not much else to say besides that it’s great quality!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Perfect Hoodie for fall,5,"This is THE perfect hoodie, I was looking for one for myself for a couple years, the womens ones just were not cutting it for what I was looking for, a longer, bit roomy fit etc-- this men's hoodie did it.  So much so that when my hubby saw it he had me order one for him too!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Runs very large,4,"It seems OK for the price.  Some dangling threads needed to clean up.  Cheap fabric feel.  But for the price it is OK and warm.IT runs WAY LARGE.  The sizing charts states to buy a large for 42-44 inch chest.  I have a 44 inch chest, and this is like a hot air balloon on me.  I'm worried that the medium will be too large, but I'm going to try it."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Comfortable, capable, and they hold up really well.",5,"I have 2 of these now, and a pull-over version from the same line.They are exactly what a hoodie should be and while they look good with a pair of jeans, they absolutely shine as real gym gear.I wear one almost every day I'm in the gym. The fabric washes well, hang drys quickly, and doesn't easily develop odors.I can wear one to the gym a couple of times without smelling like it, as long as it doesn't get banished to the bottom of the gym bag in between."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Comfortable, light weight yet sturdy, good for daily wear",5,"Great product for the price: simple, sturdy, light weight hoodie with standard quality zipper, somewhat baggy sleeves but cuffs are nicely fitted so sleeves don't creep down onto your hands, fairly deep pockets for a hoodie.  Would definitely purchase again."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,It is not heavyweight for Northern climates,2,"I wanted a heavyweight, fleeced hoodie for my husband.  I ordered these hoodies.  They are well made and are comfortable but they are not heavyweight by my standards.  They are lightweight and would probably work real well for moderate weather use."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Check your garment for defects!,4,"Nice jacket but had to return it twice. The first one had a small hole in the sleeve, the replacement had pink dye on the jacket. Nice jacket but I have no luck in purchasing it. I gave up. Waited a few months and ordered the red one it had no defects or holes. Just check it before keeping it."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Not heavyweight material. CHEAP AND THIN FABRIC,1,"Ordered small black.  It was 90%cotton 10%poly but it was thin and cheap feeling, not heavyweight at all.  Didn’t bother keeping it because I highly suspect that it will pill and shrink like my other Hanes hoodies after a couple wears and washes. Not worth $10-20.  There are much better hoodies that are actually heavyweight and higher quality for a few $ more."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Great medium hoodie jacket,5,"Got mine today fits great. Thru it in the washer then dryer. Nice quality, thick material seems nice. I'm going to order another one. I was at Target looking for a medium jacket and after looking around I had to ask a sales gal if they have more jackets. She replied no the spring line is coming soon so what is left is going on sale soon. The selection was terrible, spring line, it's the middle of January.  So just be happy Amazon has a great selection in stock for great prices. I didn't have to take several hours and go to stores,  instead I went online to Amazon, ordered what I wanted, got here in 2 days. Problem sovled."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Not too bulky or heavy,5,"My husband has low hemoglobin & is always cold in the house. I have bought 3 of them, I wash & dry them on warm, no shrinking. They aren't bulky, he loves them! I bought a 3 X which is what he wears in other clothes. It fits great. Not too heavy or bulky."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Fleece Hoodie,4,Husband likes this hoodie as I purchased it in his favorite color (green). He doesn't normally wear jackets (until it snows) but with cooler weather coming soon he thought this would bridge the difference.  The hoodie fits him perfectly and he said it didn't bind his shoulders or arms.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Hanes Sweatshirt,5,Nice comfortable heavyweight sweatshirt to lounge around in the house.  The sweatshirt shrinkage was minimal being 90% cotton 10% polyester.  I ordered a large having a 44 1/2 in. chest and still had plenty of room when I zipped up the sweatshirt.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,True to size. 📌,5,Full cut. 📌Beautiful fabric. Unexpected details such as metal reinforcements. This was a gift and I added an iron on patch for my friends favorite team the NY Yankees. He loved it and so did his wife.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Better than Walmart,4,For reference I am a woman. I should’ve gone down a size since I was ordering a men’s size. But overall the quality seems better than Walmart.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Pretty Good 🤙🏾,5,"Bought the medium. It pretty much fit as expected for the price range. I'm about 5'6/5'7 at 160ish with a slim athletic build if that helps. It scrunches a bit around the elastic areas (near the waist mostly). Light weight, keeps you warmer than expected, pretty soft and comfy."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Not very good,3,"Thin material. Not soft and fluffy like hoodies usually are when you first buy them, but stiff and scratchy like they are when youve washed them a bunch. Not a horrible hoodie but not a very good one either. Would have returned but it wasn't worth the effort, for $10 it will become a hoodie to wear whenever I dont eant to risk ruining a piece of clothing I actually like."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Well made and great price,5,I wear a ladies medium and bought this in small since it is a men’s size. This is now my favorite hoodie for the gym. It’s the perfect warmth for Texas winters and fits exactly like it should. I struggled to find what I wanted with the selection for women’s hoodies so I’m pleased I found this one. It is a well made hoodie and a great price point.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,fit and shrinkage,1,"terrible quality. washed once it shriveled up, the zipper cover (side beading) peeled back, looks like lips now. pockets are too small for my hands. This is not the Hanes quality I am used too.  purchased a xl.. at 6'1"" 215lb"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Major shrinkage.,3,Significant shrinkage in the wash. I bought 2 sizes larger than I usually wear because I expected some shrinkage and I really wanted an oversized hoodie. It shrank all the way down to my actual size. What’s worse is that the zipper didn’t shrink (of course) so now the zipper ripples and puckers really badly.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Good warm zip up,4,"I ordered both this sweater and the ecosmart hoodie, both in Large. I am a 5'4 female and usually wear a women's L/XL. The L was a little bit too long and baggy for my taste, I much preferred the fit of the ecosmart so I will be returning this one. Otherwise, the sweater is very warm. It is slightly thicker and warmer than the other but not a major difference. Very soft fleece inside but not super thick fluffy/wooly. Great purchase if the fit works for you and you are looking for a no thrills warm zip up."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Size is HUGE,2,Order 1 size down . I normally wear xl for a little extra room and comfort for a hoodie but dang this thing is MASSIVE I’m sure the large would be big on me still . I ripped off the tag already otherwise I would exchange for something smaller
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"TOO BIG., XXL Chest was 58"" NOT 52""",3,"INCORRECT Chest Measurements on Website or., the  Item was a "" Previously-Returned"" Item that someone STRETCHED., I Measuremented across the CHEST as 56"" - 58""...NOT the 52"" that's listed on Website Description..RETURNED For an XL"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"Super soft, heavy, and great for cold classrooms!",5,"Exactly what I was looking for to use in school.  I am usually not cold-natured, but my classes and office are all in cold buildings/ classrooms... so I knew I needed something that would be easy to care for and carry around while staying busy at school.  I got it oversized and it feels great!  Very thick, perfect for cold classrooms or individuals who are cold-natured, and great for both men and women."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,I own 3,5,"I wear this to the gym and love it. It's thick and just the right amount of warmth for me. A pity that the stitches by the wrist have become undone with some relatively light usage. For the price, I'll fix it myself and keep these for a good long time."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Teenager is happy,5,"Purchased for my teen daughter because apparently these are a fashion thing now? She loves it and has only taken it off to wash it. It’s comfortable, soft, and warm. Very happy with this purchase. I may even get myself one now."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Cotton Hoodie Great For Family Tie Dye!,5,Perfect for Tie Dye Night With The Family! These are the finished projects for my Husband and I. I’m 5’8” 190 and I ordered the Large and it fits Great! My Husband is 5’10” and around 260 and He ordered the 2 xl and fits great!
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Not a heavyweight hoodie!,3,"1st of all, this is not a heavyweight hoodie at all!!!!!!! It's very light weight!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was a little worried about size from what I read in the review's, I'm 5'11 165 lbs and the large fits me perfect.. Not baggy at all well maybe just a smig in the arms lol .. Again people this hoodie is not ment for being out side in the winter..this hoodie is perfect for spring weather..def a buzzkill!! Should of figured because of the prize... If They actually said lightweight hoodie I would give it 5 stars Since its  the opposite of  a heavy hoodie they get 3 stars.."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Great Fit From A Great Brand,5,"I really needed a new hoodie, this one replaced two cheap hoodies I bought at Walmart. It does surprisingly well in keeping cool Spring wind gusts from penetrating the jacket. Arm length excellent, very roomy hood, nice color blue. No complaints here."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Perfect - until I washed them.,2,"I loved the thickness and overall quality....But, I went to wash them and the length shrunk on them. They are now way shorter than I would like or use. It wasn't worth the trouble of returning them so I will unfortunately just lose the money paid for them and find someone that might be able to use them. Very disappointed."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Lightweight Full Zip Hoodie - NOT HEAVYWEIGHT,3,"NOT Heavyweight, but well constructed. If it was as heavy as described I would have gladly gave it 5 stars, bought more and even been willing to pay more. So WHY don’t they offer it like that?"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Very comfortable,4,"Excellent hoody, fit very well, 3XL without being super baggy like a tent, one person said made me look slimmer so that is always a bonus.Only draw back was the zipper is a regular, blue jean type zipper, I like a bigger, more robust zipper.  I find the bigger zippers work more smoothly."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Not High Quality,3,"Fit was good, until I washed it. Shrank a bit, but the main issue is after I washed it, a hole large enough to put your finger through developed at the seam where the cuff meets the sleeve. Only had it for a few days and had light use. Had to wash it cuz we crash landed in a lettuce field when we landed our hot air balloon ride. If that was what caused the hole, I wouldn’t be writing this review. But it happened when I washed it, so that’s pretty poor quality."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Cost Effective,4,It is worth its price in my opinion. It is quality enough without a ridiculous price tag. The only cause for alarm is that it shrinks/warps in the wash (SO WASH IT COLD UNLIKE I DID)
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Hoodies are enough with layering here in Pensacola,5,I love these hoodies. They are inexpensive and can be used for most winter days. I live in the Florida panhandle so winters are not very severe. When a storm blows in it gets cold but most days the hoodies are enough . You have to wear layers underneath but having 3 or 4 in different colors is enough 75%of the yime.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Great for Fall Weather,5,"Here in Arizona, fall weather varies from the 90s to the thirties on a day to day basis. This hoodie is light enough to wear, open, in the 60s and warm enough for the 30s when zipped up.Medium weight and very comfortable."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Great Black Sweatshirt,5,"Everyone of course wears these to death, and I was looking for a replacement for my trusty but far-too-worn fruit of the loom version. I was a little leery to change brands, but this baby is great. I can't speak for what the other colors are like, but this is the one you want in terms of fabric, size and feel."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,It's still comfortable but I feel quite tight,3,"I could rate a bit higher but there is no 3.5 stars rating. It is fair warm against chilling weather. It is not meant for freezing weather. I will not hold this jacket against that. I do think it's around 50 degrees. However, my major problem with this product is that it shrinks a lot. Especially around shoulders and sleeves. It's still comfortable but I feel quite tight. Order at least one size larger than you normally wear."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,It fits like a box.,3,I have worn a few of these over the years. Hence the reason I bought online and not in walmart where I could try it on. It doesn't seal at the bottom around your waste it seems to be shaped around the body model of an umbrellas top.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Two BIG Thumbs Up!!!,5,"I love it!!!  I use this premium (heavy) XXL to layer over my XL hoodie, for extra warmth, when needed, or removed when they’re too warm when combined.  I also like the economy (lite) hoodie for when it’s not too cold.  Oh, and I just LOVE-LOVE-LOVE the metal zippers!!!  I can’t stand nylon zippers!!!Two BIG thumbs up for Hanes hoodies!!!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Small is a large!,3,"Bought a small for my son.  With every other hoodie that I've bought for him on Amazon, a men's small with a high percentage of cotton could be washed in hot water and it would end up the perfect size for him.  But this one was huge!  Larger than a men's medium.  And it's listing on Amazon said it was 90 percent cotton, but this one was only 69 percent cotton.  So we tried washing it in hot and drying it on high several times, but it ended up being mine!"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Absolutely stylish,5,"Brought this hoodies zip up shirt for my son for Christmas. His eyes almost fell out of his eyesocket. From being so excited on how it fit, and the softness of the jacket when he comes home I told him to pick out more because he wants to have different colors. I did a good job picking it out for him👌🏽👌🏽Well done on the quality and the price👌🏽"
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,"super soft, thick fleece",5,"I'm another small woman who likes chunky hoodies, and this is a good fit. A fit tailored for a woman would probably be a little shorter in the overall length, but it's not weirdly long. Great for layering, wonderful weight -- I've been looking for a red fleece that didn't break the bank or display a company or team logo, and this one is perfect."
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,buy 10 of them!,5,Folks! A miracle has occured!  I love love love these hoodies! They are perfect! Rarely does this ever happen. I get to keep an item that i actually ordered because it is what it says it is.I ordered 3 and they were economical and perfect.Ty ty ty ty ty!
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,90/10 Heavyweight Hoodie,5,Exactly what I wanted.  This Sweat Jacket is a 90% cotton/10% poly blend which hopefully means that it will not pill.  The feel is soft but heavyweight.  Also the hood is lined.  Fit is correct for size.
Hanes Men's Full Zip Ultimate Heavyweight Hoodie,Not really heavyweight ... deep navy is on the lighter shade of blue side.,3,"Just received this sweater today. First the color Deep Navy is not that dark, it's more on the lighter blue side. If you're expecting the New York Yankees navy blue this is not it. Second this sweater is advertised as heavyweight which is far from it. It's midweight at best. I paid $10.99 for it so I'll keep it."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Great Piece Of Leather,5,"I have worn the Harley Davidson version of this jacket since the early 90's. This jacket is a serious upgrade from that jacket. The inside pockets are HUGE, which my older one doesn't have. I love how the pockets on the front vents is closed with a zipper. My old jacket uses a long strip of Velcro to keep the pockets closed when venting, which feels a LOT less secure. And this leather is so supple, much more luxuriant. And my old jacket doesn't have options for padding (I am going to pad this new jacket UP!)  I am 51 years old...6' 250lbs and I wanted a leather that will double as an outer layer for the winter months, so I ordered a size up (3XL) and I hit it out of the park with this jacket. Perfect sizing all around. Sleeves aren't too long, torso length is just the right length, roomy enough for layering, and this jacket looks amazing on me. Perfect!  There are a lot of nice touches to this jacket, the angle of the sleeve cuffs protects the outer edge of my hand, almost up to the bottom pinky knuckle and the cuff zippers go up the front of my wrists and into the center of the palm, providing a LOT of protection for when I fall on my ass an reach out with my hands to break the fall. My older jacket doesn't do that. Very smart design.  I love how anonymous it is. All the snaps and zippers are blank. My old jacket has Harley Davidson markings on all of that (I have never owned a Harley). This is a gorgeous, well thought out, luxuriant, attractive jacket. I am now an intelligent looking, sophisticated - man about town."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,A great choice for me...,5,"I was shopping for more than a year trying to decide what style of leather jacket, what manufacturer, and what size. I decided on this jacket, which is a nice combination of off-center zippers on traditional motorcycle jackets and the centered zippers of ""café"" styles. Also in my research I became convinced of the quality of jackets from First Mfg. over other brands. But I was not so sure about the third issue (size). Every manufacturer seems to have its own way of sizing, so it's a bit of a coin toss (if coins had ten sides). Fortunately, I trusted the chart posted for this jacket, which meant ordering the size of all my shirts and jackets—XXL—and it fits perfect! I think most buyers can trust the size chart here.The quality is there. The leather is heavy and should provide plenty of warmth and protection. The leather also feels soft enough that it doesn't need any breaking-in, though I expect it will become even softer with wear and develop a nice patina. The lining is the typical type and seems well made with quality fabric. The zip-out features are well thought out, with two snap tabs in each sleeve to hold it in place, and it zips in and out with little fuss. It provides an extra layer of warmth with very little bulk. Even the gun pockets will come in handy, though not for guns. Finally, the sleeves have the extra length for reaching the handlebars, but not ridiculously long when not riding, and the length of the coat itself is perfect, reaching just enough below my belt to give cover when sitting in the saddle.Living in western New England, this will jacket will be much appreciated on cool fall and early-spring days, as well as on those beautiful winter days when it warms up enough to ride and on my longer rides to Montréal and Maine."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Great Jacket,5,"My biggest concern when buying this coat was the sizing.  I have been looking for a good leather coat at local retail shops for a few months, but couldn't find anything that fit.  I am pretty large, wearing tshirts at 2XL, but any coat I tried on (even if it was listed at 5X) was too tight for me, especially around the shoulders.  After looking at the other reviews here and measuring myself with a tape measure from my garage, I determined 2XL should work, but 3XL would be a better choice so I bought the 3XL.  It arrived today and I tried it on right away, and it fits great.It is heavier and warmer than I was expecting, but there is a removable inner liner to help reduce that a bit.  The tradeoff is that it is a bit uncomfortable on the skin without the liner, but I expect that I'll get used to that in short order.This coat has A LOT of pockets and other zippers to allow/block air flow.  I don't think I'll be able to find them all.  There are tons of places to store things in the jacket and zip them up securely.  Overall, it seems to be a really good jacket and is worth at least twice the price I paid for it."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Excellent quality leather,5,Very nice jacket. This is a heavy weight riding jacket yet it seems to have enough ventilation to still be comfortable in warmer weather.  I haven't used it in warm weather yet so we will see how it works in a Tennessee sumer soon. I couldn't be happier with this jacket so far. Great quality and more features than any riding jacket I have ever owned in my 37 years of riding.
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Great Leather Motorcycle Jacket,5,Great motorcycle jacket for the price. Excellent workmanship and high quality. Why spend hundreds more? This jacket is made of high grade leather. Sizing is a little small. I wear a 2XL but ordered a 3XL and am glad that I did. The 3XL fits me perfectly. I recommend ordering one size up. The zippered air vents in the front and back make it comfortable to wear the jacket when riding on warmer days. I highly recommend this jacket.
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Sizing,5,To have a good look at the sizing chart I'm 175lb and 6ft with a 42in chest and a size small fits me snug. I have not had any problems with the overall quality of the jacket but I'll update this review if I do. I'm pretty sure these leather jackets were fitted for people who are avid beer drinkers because the mid-section is more round shaped than tapered and the small fits people who are usually a medium or a large but it still looks good. 10/10 would buy from again!
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Incredible jacket,5,Was worried about ordering without try the jacket on but the size chart was perfect. I am 6ft 235lb and the body was snug without being tight and the sleeves long enough to fit my “ape arms”. A really nice jacket that feels like it will last for decades
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Great jacket.,5,"You get what you pay for. This jacket is well worth it. Very comfortable and looks great. Plenty of big pockets and the vents really work well. I ordered a large but was swimming in it. The med fits me perfectly. I'm 6' 1"" about 195lb and always have trouble finding jackets that are long enough to the waist and sleeves but this 1 fits well."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,GREAT JACKET!!,5,Have owned the jacket for about two months. Put about 1k miles on the bike while wearing the jacket during that time. So far couldn't be happier.Definitely keeps you protected from the wind and warm in the crazy fall Ohio weather. I always go with layers so I can adjust to the temperature. In warmer weather removing the liner and opening the vents helps with temp regulation. I would say this jacket it best suited for cooler weather but can work in the warm stuff if needed.Luckily I haven't tested the jacket's crash/abrasion protection qualities yet. Have no plans to either.
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN!!!,3,"Today is the first day that I wore the jacket.  I was looking forward to that great tanned leather smell.  Nope, is smells like a fish market.  I like the jacket but the odor is nasty.  Now what I do???"
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Don't buy it,1,"The jacket doesn't fit well , too big for the size, I request the company to return and they ask me to pay for the return plus 20% restock fee , be aware this is just another company ripping off the customers . Pay $200 for the jacket and will pay more than $100 to send it back plus the restock fee."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Wrong size,1,The jacket is heavy but looks good. Unfortunately it is not true to size and was too small. My husband wears 5xl but in jackets he gets a bigger size and the 6xl was too small in the shoulders.
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Good jacket--terrible zippers.,3,"I'm not sure how much the manufacturer saved by cheaping out on the zippers, but it's a real shame they did.  The zippers are all plastic with painted alloy pulls.  My third time wearing the jacket I was pulling the wrist zipper closed and the pull split in half. (see picture above).  I'm contacting Amazon for a solution.  Without the zipper the jacket is virtually useless.  A motorcycle jacket should really have steel zippers."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,First Mnaf. Mastermind Cruising Jacket,5,"Well made and somewhat supple leather. As Soon as you receive it, condition the leather and you will be Very Pleased. Lots of storage and feels like it's going to last for a years or at least until I expire."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Worth what you pay for!,5,"This is my first leather jacket and I couldn’t be more happy with the quality and comfort of this one. Definitely a big purchase, but in my case it was worth the investment. I read the reviews of this product trying to find out what size to get and in my case I am 5’11 around 185 lbs. pretty athletic and I ordered a large and it fits great."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,"Yeah, this is the one to buy!",5,"I've been trying to find a replacement leather for 6 months now, this is the only one that's even close to the quality I'm used to.  Very heavy, fits great (XXL size was right on with what the chart says) and even comfortable in the arms.  This is NOT a casual jacket; this is a serious piece of outerwear."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,A little pricey,5,Nothing
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,top notch leather,5,"top notch leather. soft, heavy, and thick. while not being overkill. i wear a large vest in this brand but the large coat is a little big in the chest for me. im 5ft11in 180lbs"
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Best riding jacket!,5,"If you can find one, get it! These are hard to come by"
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Amazing,5,What a beautiful leather jacket. I didn’t expect as much from previous jackets and I’m impressed!
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Great jacket,5,"While I was put off at first by the price, this jacket had the features that I wanted. I definitely made the right decision! The ability to carry a lot of items in the jacket with its many pockets saves me from having to dip into my saddlebags for the small items I often carry. The quality is truly top-shelf and I am sure I will get at least a decade out of it. Very pleased and I would certainly buy from these folks again."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Does the job... But... Eh...,3,"Like most people, I had a hard time with sizing. I'm 6'2"" but my torso is short and wide. The XL gives me just the right amount of room... Until I sit on my bike, then it seems like an XXL. It pushes up into my neck and makes riding uncomfortable. I've been riding in 35-40 degree weather for about a week and it does keep me very warm. The vents/pockets combo on the front does seem a little complicated, but having so much space for your stuff is a plus. Also, after reading other posts, I tried to be very delicate with the cuff zippers, but it didn't seem to matter. Two days after the return period expired, both zippers came off. It's almost like they were designed to do so."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Go 1 size larger,5,"This is a good heavy leather jacket. Has large zipper vents on the front and the back for the hot days.  I went 1 size larger after reading the reviews and am happy that I did that.  Haven't had a chance to ride in it yet, but I'm confidant that this leather jacket will have years of use behind it before it wears out or I get to fat to wear it:)"
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Amazing looking jacket,5,"Great quality, design and features. Totally love it."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,"High Quality leather MC Jacket,",5,This Leather MC jacket is for bikes in the Harley Davison group for flying high and riding long. It's vented when riding through the back vents closed by zippers. This also meets in my opinion the Cal DMV safety requirements. I haven't tried wearing it in 95 degree weather but I will soon. Itf you want a very good Jacket this is it.
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Wonderful!!!,5,"Great Leather jacket!! I bought this jacket for my husband for his birthday. It was a little small when he tried it on, so I sent it back for an exchange. Great customer service and a fast replacement!  My husband loves this coat!  Great quality!  Great price! Great service!!  Thank you!!!"
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Nice but cheap fixture,5,"Very nice jacket, great fit,many pockets and indeed supple as described by others. Only problem I had is with a finger tab on one of the sleeve zippers and am expecting more as they are made of a cheap pot metal that broke. I am surprised that such a high quality jacket would have something that poor on it. I will have to get a small fob with a snap link or split ring like those found on key chains to put on the zipper traveler so that I can open and close the zipper"
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Greatest leather jacket ever!!!!,5,"Guys I gotta say this is just perfect, far beyond my expectations. Nice leather, great piece of work! the only thing go one size up. I'm 6 feet 210 lbs, I got the XL and it fits perfectly. Really nice feel wearing it, it will surely last for years. I had been checking and checking here in amazon for hours different models of leather jackets but definetely this is the one!!"
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Strange pocket design,3,"This is a very heavy, thick leather jacket, but the front pockets are very complicated. Unsnapping the pocket flap, and then unzipping the vent allows the front to 'peel back', allowing you to unzip the mesh and thereby access two interior pockets and a elastic cord whose purpose escapes me. You cannot access these hidden pockets from the interior of the jacket, so anything placed in these pockets may require a map to locate later.  Also, within two days, the zipper that tightens the left wrist area broke off in my hand. I don't consider this a design fault, so I won't bother sending it back, but it certainly reflects on the quality of YKK zippers.  The exterior hand pockets are on the small size, barely large enough to hold a smart phone. The two interior pockets seem to be of decent size and are accessed through vertical slits rather than horizontal ones.  Overall, this is a decent jacket but I really can't consider it as 'user-friendly', although it is rather ingenious in design."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,mens leather jacket,4,"great coat good value, BUT  the sizing runs very small, Ive just grown into a 4x and still is a little big, so ordered an 8x, and IT FITS even a little big, I can wear a sweatshirt under it, until it gets wet, and shrinks some"
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Husband loves it!,5,"Bought it as a gift for my husband and he is very pleased.  The jacket is made amazingly well; especially considering the very reasonable price.  This jacket is heavy, blocks all the wind while motorcycle riding, and has numerous pockets that all stay closed tightly while riding."
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,took awhile,5,"looked high n low before i found a coat that fit me the way i wanted,very good workmanship,price you cant beat it with a stick,ordered 1 size bigger as i have read from others who reviewed it.cant go wrong with jacket,would buy from again...Donny Lewis"
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,Nice riding jacket,5,I really like it fit is true to size well made and a lot of pockets
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,House of Harley Mens Utility Cruising Leather Jacket,5,Bought this leather jacket for my husband to wear when he was riding his Harley Motorcycle. For the price this is a great leather jacket. The inside shell can be removed on warmer days and added back in on cooler days. It was very comfortable.
Mastermind - Men's Leather Motorcycle Jacket,I love this jacket,5,I love this jacket! It's a tad short in the arms and when I ride it rises slightly in the back but I'm sure those things will change as I break in the jacket.

"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",AMAZING JACKET,5,Looks exactly like the photo fits perfect excellent quality excellent zipper quality very happy with this purchase
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Good for the price,5,Jacket fit perfectly I’m 5’6 160 pounds and I got a small and it fits like I expected.
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Awesome for men and women!,5,I bought this because women’s jackets are overpriced and usually have sleeves that don’t reach my wrists. Freaking loooove this jacket. It’s simple and light. It’s very well made and would recommend to any gender!
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Cheap windbreaker,2,"First, it's just a windbreaker, not a jacket.  No insulation.  Fit and color are okay.  The zippers are cheap metal.  The main zipper is backwards for a man's jacket, better for a left-handed person.  The zippered pocket on the sleeve has the stitching coming loose after just three wearings, I'll have to mend it soon.  Next time I'll shop more carefully."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Wrong Gender Sent,3,"I ordered the Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Jacket, but received a Women's Jacket-Lightweight Jacket. The jacket itself fit perfectly, with the exception of the zipping on the wrong side for me. In fact, I like the jacket so much that I will order another ""Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Flight Bomber Jacket"".  However, if I receive another women's jacket I will return the item."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",CHEAP QUALITY. DONT WASTE MONEY,1,The product has a very cheap quality. The zippers are very cheap and the material used is extremely low quality
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",SOOO small!,4,"Let me start out by saying I had to order 3 of these, each one a different size up in order to find one that wasn't made for a 9 year old.These run super small. My shirt size is a USA medium/large, I'm 5 foot 11 muscular build, and the large was terribly small.I might have fit into it when I was 14, maybe.If you're going to order this, think 2 to 3 sizes bigger. The one that I eventually ended up getting that didn't constrict my body into unconciousness ended up being  XL, and it still fits a bit slim.Otherwise, it's a nice little super ultra light jacket. Kinda feels like wearing a garbage bag with some thin cloth around it, which was great during summer."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Shiny Zippers ruin the jacket,1,"Everything is fine about the jacket but the zippers are obnoxiously shiny and bright compared to the muted base color.  Looking at it all a person would think is SHINY ZIPPERS.  Pretty dorky looking for a bomber, which is supposed to be low profile and minimalistic.  The zippers are shinier than the pictures represent."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",A really slick and good looking jacket with an athletic fit.,5,"I picked this jacket up due to the generally positive reviews, and because my wife and I both thought it looked sharp.  I am 6'2"", 190 lbs.  I have a fairly athletic build. 32"" waist and 44"" jacket, and I purchased the large.  It fits me like I had it made to measure.  Plenty of sleeve length, a good fit around the wrists and neck, and surprisingly, a taper to the waist that is not often found in inexpensive clothes.  It produces a leaner profile.  The zippers are of excellent quality with substantial all-steel pulls.  The left bicep pocket is actually useful at times, but I mostly keep candy in it. It would probably work well for an ipod.  This is a good light jacket for athletic use or in moderate weather.  I have had this jacket a little while and it does a pretty good job of stopping rain and wind from spoiling your fun, and is also stylish enough to wear casually."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL","Does not keep you warm but its light, stylish, high-quality and windbreaker-ish",4,"I bought this for my boyfriend.What i do like is the material its a wind breaker but its so smooth like, high quality material. The jacket is light but heavier than a windbreaker but i doubt you can feel the difference when you put it on. The zipper is so smooth too when you zip up and down. Doesn't make that nasty cheap zippers noise or stops you every inch. But I dont like how there's no patting or that criss cross patting to keep you warm like at least a little. I thought I bought a ""bomber jacket"" not a bomber jacket like that's a wind breaker. I will be keeping it though. Luckily I bought a bigger size on accident. I'll just have my boyfriend wear it over a hooded sweater."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Comfy well-make jacket,5,"Generally, I quite like this jacket and I think I got good value for my money. If I could make one small change, I wish there was a Velcro or snap closure on the inner pocket. I use it for my cell phone, but the lack of a closure means there is nothing to keep the cell from falling out if I, say, take my jacket off and set it somewhere. There is a zipper pocket on the left sleeve, but I prefer to keep my cell on the inside pocket. Even so, I'm not sorry I bought it; nice jacket for the price."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",It’s a great jacket!,5,"This jacket is great! You might want to order a size bigger though, unless you are super fit with six pack abs and not really broad shoulders. I usually wear an XL but I had to order the 2X. I’m 5’8” and weigh 220, so I’m a pretty big solid dude. Anyways, the color of this jacket in that green is awesome. Goes with my camouflage pants, some people even say it brings out the color in my eyes. I wore it out to dinner and received a few compliments and someone even asked me where I bought this sweet jacket at. You should have seen the look on their face when I told them I bought it off Amazon! Great Jacket, Great Quality, Great Color and Great Price!"
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Ran small,4,"I usually wear an XL in my shorts, and jackets, in order for them to be a little loose and comfortable.  This jacket was way too tight in the body, and too short in the torso.  I was surprised that the arms were an okay length, as that is typically where coats and jackets fail me.  I do think I could have gotten used to the zipper pull being on the other side of normal (zipper on the left, versus the right)... but I've no choice but to return this, and consider the next size up."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",My grandson has it,5,Very nice jacket. Appears well made. Sticking is great and without a flaw. Material is lightweight and very comfortable. So much so that my grandson decided he would wear it. So it was the week after his birthday so I gave him another birthday gift. I thought it really said something about the jacket the he tried it on and fit so well he didn't want to take it of.  It fit both of us well and for me as expected. I now am in the market again for me another jacket and considering the same jacket but probably a different color. Don't want to crowd his style.
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Very disappointed with the color - color (Royal Blue) is two shades lighter than image on Amazon,2,"Royal Blue - TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual - Fabric feels good (large size - I'm 6:2, medium build), but Royal Blue color is lighter color and sheen duller than advertised - I was hoping for the color in Amazon roll-over. Metal zipper is a bit harder to zip/unzip but still seems good quality. If you are buying dependent on color, think twice. Same was true from the Khaki #02 color was lighter and duller than representation on Amazon."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Solid jacket,5,"Fit as i expected, i have a shorter torso so maybe it was just me or my preference but the length was maybe 2-3 inches longer than id like but the length in the arms was perfect. The quality of the jacket is easily worth the price. Nice color as well."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL","Great looking, well-constructed, fall/spring jacket",5,"My son chose this jacket and has worn it every day since. It looks more mature than pulling on a hoodie and he hates the ""puffy"" look so this worked well for him. Warm enough for cool fall/spring days, simple lines, small details like the zipper on the sleeve all make it a good choice.  Well constructed jacket and the price was an added bonus."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL","Nice Jacket, but Runs Small",5,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He had been wanting it for a while and was on his wishlist.  However, when it arrived, I knew that it would be too small.  Overall he loved it and it was exactly what he wanted.  It just didn't fit.  It does run small."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Fitz just right,4,"Liked this jacket it fits just right. It was just what I was looking for.Only one but on the jacket, the zippers are on the left side, I don't know what is happening with today's manufacturers but they're making all these zippers  on the left side. Other than that I like the jacket. I have received nothing but compliments on the jacket."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL","Bought a size up, and the arms are too tight",2,"I purchased this jacket for my boyfriend'a starlord cosplay. The reviews from others suggested buying a size up, so I did. Quality of material is great and the color is perfect, but it is almost like they sewed the wrong arms on the jacket. The width of the arms was so tiny and tight for an XL. I wear a small and it just barely fits the width of my arms. I will have to return this one, and have ordered a size up so hopefully the arms are better on that one. But this cosplay needs to be done by the weekend so I was forced to pay for overnight shipping this time around... :("
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Fits great and very light,4,"Perfect lightweight spring jacket. It’s ad described and fits great reason for 4 stars is that there are a few loose strings on the inside of the jacket. I don’t expect it to last more than maybe this spring and early fall but it was pretty cheap so I didn’t expect much more. All in all, great fit but not the best quality."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Tacvasen makes GOOD stuff,5,"Hammacher-Schlemmer sold me a WWII bomber jacket made by Tacvacsen, total $119. Bought exaxt jacket for my wife here for $45. H-S told me it's not the same. I e-mailed ""Colin"" the PROOF. He didn't answer. GREAT jackets. Wanted one for my wife, FORGOT I'd already bought her a NB. I'm very high on this producer."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Looks more expensive than it is,5,"I get daily compliments about this jacket; despite it costing less than 10% of my leather jacket, this gets way more compliments. I love it! It’s not really meant for the rain even though it looks like it is — I still wear it and risk getting soaked :)"
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",I like,5,Light jacket is very well made.  I was especially impressed with the silk like liner that lines the whole jacket.  I’m really glad I bought this jacket and the fit is perfect!
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",This isn't a men's jacket. False advertising.,1,This is a women's jacket that they are selling as a men's. The zipper is on the wrong side and its tailored to fit women. It's also very thing and feels like it's made of a cheap tent. Do not buy.
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Two sizes too small,3,"I normally wear Large in shirts and jackets. I wanted a light weight jacket to wear over a fleece jacket, so I ordered X-Large in khaki. This one seems more like a Medium, too tight for me.Others have complained about wrinkles, and it's easy to see why. Mine came stuffed into an 11"" x 12"" Zip-Loc type bag. Those wrinkles might have smoothed out after washing, but who knows?The quality of construction, stitching, zippers, etc seems fine. Amazon made the return virtually effortless."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",fits perfectly,5,I needed a lightweight jacket that I could wear when it was slightly windy or when it was a little cool out without making me get overheated.  this jacket delivers and best of all does not look cheap.
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Nice light jacket,4,I use this to ride my cafe racer. I wear a hoodie under it and it does the job blocking the wind. I like the look of this jacket. Glad I ordered it. Looks like the picture. No complaints.
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL","Great, minus the pine fresh scent!",5,"Great product. Exactly what I expected and looks really nice in person. Pretty good quality considering the price, and overall happy with the purchase.One minor detail, smelled like pine all out of the package. I’m unsure what that’s about but otherwise satisfied."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Get larger size,5,"Normally I wear a large size, however I initially ordered an XL size.  Had to return as it was a little tight.  Ended up getting the 2X.  (Arms were a tad long but, the jacket fit better across the shoulders and chest).  Will keep the 2X jacket.  PS.  I really like the jacket."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Perfect!,5,"Great quality. Perfect in almost all weather.If you're looking for a nice quality, water resistant and stylish bomber to add to your wardrobe I absolutely recommend buying.It goes with almost every fit I put together."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Great value,5,I love this jacket for spring and fall type weather. It's not too heavy that you sweat on those days where it's just a bit chilly. Nice fashionable look. The zippers are nice and heavy duty and bring a nice pop of silver to the jacket.
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Great - especially for the price,5,"This is a lightweight jacket that is great quality. I am 6'0 and 174. Perfect Large fit, even the sleeve length. Have no complaints. This was a super buy."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Lightweight and comfortable,5,"I usually wear a L in jackets but glad I sized up to an XL. It is comfortable but definitely just a windbreaker, not especially warm, but does the job in mild weather."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Size up and you’ll be loving it!,5,"Definitely order a size up! My boyfriend wears medium shirts and I told i him to get a large jacket, which he did. And the large fits perfectly! He loves this jacket :) not heavy and thick (which he hates) it’s more of windbreaker material, great to wear over a T-shirt or long sleeve on a chilly day"
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Great Light Jacket,5,"The fit is great and I've gotten many compliments about the jacket.  The jacket is light and is meant to be worn on top of whatever your wearing.  It helps keep you warm and is water-resistant, but this not a sweatshirt (in terms of warmth) nor is it a raincoat (in terms of water-repellant).  I love it though."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Great jacket .,4,"I liked this jacket ,but will be returning it because it is a little small for me , its not as warm as i needed. If it would have fit I probably would have kept it tho."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Great buy,5,"Perfect size and style that I am looking for, comfort and warm enough for the climate. We love it, definitely will buy another color"
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Feels like wearing a garbage bag,2,"Feels like I'm wearing a garbage bag, and the quality is sub-par at best. I guess you get what you pay for, but it just feels like I'm wearing a $10 coat. Don't recommend."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Fitting was not good and the pocket inside was having torn,2,The size was big. Needed to return. Seller was good. Gave the refund earlier.
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Don’t waste your time or money...,1,"I was really looking forward to having this bomber jacket for those cool, breezy summer evenings. I am very disappointed with the product I received. I ordered a size larger than I needed, and it still is way too small. Jacket is cheaply made and is loud (swishing sound when you even think of moving your arm(s)). Will be returning and ordering a different brand."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Jacket,5,Bought this for husband to wear to gymHe loves the look an feelPerfect for the money
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",fits great. Looks pretty good.,4,Much better than I predicted. I do wish zipper was available male standard! But otherwise works well in the shop. Should be helpful for my motorcycle too.
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Nice and lightweight. Looks good!,5,Nice and light weight but still keeps a bit of body heat in. Good for style and fashion but when you don’t want to overheat with a heavy leather jacket.
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Returned next day,1,"All you see is zippers and its a woman's jacket. Will not purchase again, what a waste of time."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Nice,5,"Feels like good quality, light weight & not to puffy. Perfect to top off any outfit"
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Very plasticy.,2,"I wasn't expecting this to be quite as plastic feeling and looking as it was.  I'm sure it'll do it's job, but it looks like a garbage bag."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",I ordered the size I usually do and I wasn't able to zip it up.,5,"I gave it to my daughter and ordered the XXL, which fits pretty well."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",So comfortable,5,"Before my trip, Ill wear it often and comfortably. Worth price."
"TACVASEN Lightweight Jacket for Men Softshell Fall Thin Bomber Coat, Black 2XL",Zipper is wonky,4,"European zipper... Wrong side, but other than that, good."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,This is such a badass jacket!,5,"Anyone who is looking for a top quality m65 jacket this is the jacket for you. Look no further. Ive had rothco before which is pretty much the same kind of jacket but this jacket basically is the rothco m65 juiced up on roids. This is such a great jacket. As soon as I opened up the package I knew it was gonna fit right. The quality is thick. Its not thin and I was concerned the sleeves were gonna be longer than my arms and theyre just right. This jacket fits me perfectly and as expected. I am 510 170 lbs and the jacket fits perfectly all around and i ordered a medium, which is hard for me to find a perfect formed jacket that actually fits. The look is completely badass. This is gonna be my go to jacket for sure this fall. I collect jackets and this one will def be used. Theres a bunch of comments people have left about sizing being wrong. Disregard those posts because they had me concerned at first but fear not this jacket fits as expected..."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Ummm...,3,"How the hell do you people size your stuff?! I got a 3xl, the torso fits like an XL and the arms fit like a 3XL. Did you mix and match sizes or something? Other than that the jacket is beautiful. Returning it though..."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Deceptive photograph hides ""slim fit.""",2,"The quality of this piece is very good.  But worse, the seller's photography gives the impression that the jacket is blousy and so would fit most normal people, who, in the United States, are not slim 18-year-olds.  Well, it fit me okay, but too tight generally, and nothing like the windbreaker I expected from the photography."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Perfect fit and much better than expected.,5,"I almost never write reviews but this time is different.  This jacket exceeds my expectations. It's very hard for me to find a good it in anything but I liked the look so much I took a chance and I'm very happy I did. I'm 6' 3"" inches and 260 lbs. The 2xl is a perfect fit. The length fits like it was a tall size which is what I alway look for."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"This jacket deserves a 5 star rating, but .....",4,"The jacket is great! My husband is very pleased! Can't wait for cooler weather so he can wear it! And, if the vendor will finally answer a question I've now asked twice, I'll change my rating to 5 stars without hesitation. Question: How do we clean this jacket when we have to? There were no instructions in the package when it arrived. That's all I want. Should be simple, right?"
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,WOW!!  Incredibly Surprised!!!,5,"For the past few years I've attempted to buy clothing from Asian manufacturers and had very little luck do to vast sizing issues.  When I ordered this jacket (khaki), I thought it would be the same but I was WRONG!  This jacket is amazing!As soon as I took it out of the packaging I was in awe.  I couldn't stop smiling because the jacket was even BETTER than I thought it was going to be when I ordered it.  The khaki is a beautiful rich color, ALL the pockets (snap and zipper) are REAL pockets (even thought I read in reviews that some were fake), stitching and snaps look great, and the great surprise to me was the accent stitching down the sleeves.  I had no idea that accent was there when ordering but it's the perfect Star Wars look that I looking to achieve for a costume.Fit is perfect and is true to size.  I'm 5'9.5"" and around 205 lbs and the Large fits perfectly.This jacket has a really good weight to it and is perfect for cooler early spring or fall weather.  My only complaint is that the zipper pull is on the left side instead of the normal right side, but I think that's just how they do it in Europe/Asia.Overall, I'm elated with this jacket.  So much so that I just bought another one because I had originally planned on ripping out/hiding the zippers for the costume, but it's such a nice jacket I want to wear it a daily jacket.  Heck, the first time I wore it in public the first person that saw gave me a compliment on it.  It's really that nice.  An incredible value and I give it 5 stars which I RARELY give on product reviews."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,A note on size,4,"I'm 6' 1""-2"", 180-lb male slender male with 34""-inch waist and slightly broad shoulders, and ordered a Large jacket. If anything the Large is a tad long over a T-shirt with the waistband around mid-glute area ... sleeves, chest and shoulders fit very well. Over a sweatshirt or heavier clothing, the waistband comes up to just below beltline and fits perfectly ... which should be the case for larger-waisted individuals of similar height. Jacket looks great, left-side zipper is fine by me."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Great jacket and a great fit,5,"What a great jacket. It even has two top pockets. I'm 5'9"" and 190 lbs, 36"" waist, I got the large and it fit great."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,You'll look warm...but not classy.,2,"This product somehow looks much better in the pictures. In person it just looks...cheap. Usually I'm pretty pleased with my purchases but this just reminds me of shopping on Wish...stuff looks awesome in pictures, but what you get in the mail looks like it came from the Dollar General. The jacket fits alright, it just doesn't look impressive. Even the collar in the picture looks cool and flared out...the collar on the jacket I received looks stubby and curled in on itself. You could get something of this quality for cheaper at the derpmart."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Cosplay concept, but may have to add to Fall coat collection.",4,"I have been watching this style jacket through Wish and Banggood as well as Amazon. A significant proportion of the reviews related poor quality or numerous defects, but I was purchasing this jacket as part of a cosplay so was not entirely worried as long as quality was functional. I am looking to do a Power Loader operator or a colonial marine - still waiting for all the patches/parts to arrive to make a final decision. In the final calculation,  went with Amazon as they had the ability to return if there were issues with the jacket that I could not work around. They were significantly higher in price, but if I got a dud in quality then at least I had an option to return. All of the pockets are functional, they are a little small, but I did not have to rip any seams or make cuts to be able to use them. The material of the jacket is accurate to the pictures shown AND most importantly the sizing information provided was accurate to the size chart provided. The jacket is not at the same level of quality as I would purchase from a US coat store, but I was originally only interested in the army surplus look on the exterior for style. However, once I have finished adding design patches, this could become my new Fall jacket. An unexpected win. If there are issues with the jacket in the future, I will update my review."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,(See edit) Great jacket. Would have gotten a size M instead of L though.,3,"Really like the jacket. I'm 6'2 and weigh 170lbs. I ordered a size L based on the measurements in the photos and reviews. If I could go back and get a size M instead, I would. Then again, I like my clothes and jackets to be a little more form fitting. When I'm happy with it anyway, it's not worth the hassle of packing it back up and driving it the UPS store and await an exchange though. Just something to keep in mind when ordering.My only critique would be that the silky lining is really nice, but I would have preferred another kind of fabric for the inside of the main pockets. When it's below freezing outside and you stick your hands in your pockets, the silky material doesn't do much to warm them up. Other than that, great jacket.Edit: Taking 2 stars off. After having this jacket for 3 months, the stitching of the inside pocket has broken and a hole is widening. I'm gonna sew it back up before I lose the entire pocket, but I'm pretty disappointed that it needs to be done. All I put in that pocket is either my phone or my wallet. Nothing overtly heavy that would put stress on the stitching."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Good value purchase. But China needs to shut up.,4,"Pro: The materials used is very comfortable. Will make for a very nice Fall and Spring jacket. I may purchase another jacket so I can wear a couple more layers for additional warmth. I believe it is worthy of repeating my self - this jacket is very comfortable!Con: Made in China. Because of this, you will find that the zipper zips up on the left side (feminine). I am not at all familiar with this type of zipper. I believe the pro's and con's carry eqaul weight. Also, on one hand the Chinese want to sell this jacket. But on the other hand they are pushing propaganda on the United States and bad-mouthing U.S. buyers. Normally that would be enough to make me pass on buying, but I made the purchase before the childish communist propaganda got started."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Waist is  a narrow fit but I'm fit so it fits.,5,"Well, I love it ! Fits perfect on me. I usually fit a medium but the chart said I needed a small so I got a small.  Bam!  It fits.  I was worried but…Waist is a narrow fit but I'm  fit so it fits. BUT ! what I'm worried about is the shrink factor after it comes out of dryer.  Will it still fit or will it be a size for toddlers ? I gues I'll have to remember NOT to put in dryer but just air dry outside or something after washing in cold water.  No one has mentioned this factor so im definitely worried about that."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Nice and roomy but not baggy,5,"I'm 6'1-2"", 175# without clothes, and a 34"" waist. I wear 34"" waist pants, and normally take a medium shirt or jacket, but this jacket in a  large fits just right, with enough blousing to wear a sweater underneath without feeling too baggy without the sweater.  I think a medium would have fit like a slim fitted shirt with little room inside, so I'm glad I ordered the large. The lower elastic band pulled down rests about 4"" below the belt which allows for stretch movements while keeping the lower part of the jacket snug at or below the belt in a strong breeze, such as riding a motorcycle. The elastic cuffs ride slightly onto my hand and are snug enough to keep the wind out. Pockets with snaps have the depth of a dress shirt pocket. Zippered pockets above are deep enough to hold a 6"" cell phone when zippered. There is one deep open ended interior pocket on the left side. The jacket material feels rugged for its design, which is lighter weight.  I haven't washed it, but will probably wash it in cold water to keep the same fit."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Fits Nicely, Bit Tight In The Waist",4,"Ordered a large, I'm 5'5"" and 227 lbs, trans female to male. I have a larger chest but with my binder on or off, the jacket fits great. It's a bit tight around the waist, but I can still zip it up with a flannel shirt on. The lining material is soft and doesn't feel overly slick and uncomfortable.All of the buttons are snap buttons and it's light to mid-weight enough to wear out on a day that's going to start out around 'see your breath' temperatures and end in the 70s. Throw a sweater or flannel under it and you're good to go for chillier weather. The ribbed fabric around the bottom, wrists, and neck is soft and keeps snow out. Not too tight or too loose."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Actually a great medium sized jacket,5,"I was on the fence, expect the worst and be very pleasantly surprised. For most this will be a light jacket but I am a biker and I ride all year round and through Donner Pass on 80. I'm a cold weather person and this will be my liner for my leather coat and if actually gets cold enough I got a hoodie to use as a liner for this awesome friggen jacket. So far fit and finish is perfect. I'm  5'6"" 164 and it fits my shoulders and arm length it is right at the border for me and I could have gotten a Large and been just as happy. But my chest, neck and shoulders from work are a bit on the large size, if you work out with weights you'd better go large with out question but then you probably already know that. Very nice buttons feel solid to me yes the zipper is on the wrong side I guess  but I could give a rats rear end. Yes I strain to be polite and why I don't this much."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Buttons have already come off after wearing once,1,"Bought this for my 20 year old son. The color and fit were fine. What I am disappointed about was he wore it once for about 2 hours to run errands and a whole button and a half has already fallen off. It wasn’t from pulling it unbuttoned because he didn’t even have it snapped. This is just frustrating and disappointing! I know that ordering clothing online can really be hit-or-miss, but this is just frustrating. You might want to think about some quality control..."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Absolutely not what is advertised,1,Absolutely not what was ordered the pictures show a nice military style jacket what came was this super thin long sleeve shirt
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Fit issues explained, and some other impressions",4,"I am 5’9”, 180 pounds. Having tried the size L on, I now better understand the irregularities in sizing people are raising. For a jacket that seems inspired by the jackets worn by paratroopers in WWII, this fits a little more like an “Ike” jacket, with the size large hitting me pretty much right at the hip. I could have sized up for a more authentic-feeling torso length and a bit more room in the chest, but then the arm length would have been too long. So it’s simply a matter of proportion - this doesn’t have the cut of a true “field jacket.”Material is a little lighter than I would have guessed from earlier reviews - definitely not cut out for winter wear here in Vermont. A good late-spring jacket for this climate.One peculiarity of note: the zipper is on the left, like in an American women’s coat, though the flap covering the zipper is also on the left side. This isn’t terribly important, but it does mean you will probably need two hands to zip.Overall, it’s a nice-looking jacket, clearly inspired by - but not intended as a replica of - military uniforms of the mid-20th century. If you are looking for a fairly accurate knock-off of an issued field jacket, this isn’t it. If you want something that feels like an updated cousin of that jacket, and you are okay with the few issues above, this fits the bill."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Arrived with a hole in the back.,3,"There is a seam across the back that was not sown properly leaving an inch hole in the middle of the back. I elected to sew it rather than send it back. I'm 5'11"" 180lb and the large was a little too roomy. The oddest thing is the left handed zipper. I might get used to it but for now zipping takes more attention. The snap buttons have two protrusions on the side you press your thump against (not smooth). This gives the sensation, I'm pressing on the wrong side of the snap button.  The jacket looks as expected. The lapel zippers actually do have pockets which was a nice surprise. I hate fake zippers to nowhere."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Fits good, looks great!",5,"I usually wear a large but I got XL because I plan to wear a tactical fleece hooded jacket under it.  These run true to size and the XL is a bit big on me so I very carefully washed and dried it (less than 10 min in dryer) and it shrank.  It's perfect but I mainly mention this to let you all know that this will shrink!!  All in all I really like this jacket, It's pretty sharp looking and goes well with my coyote brown fleece, the coat alone is not real heavy.  On mine the zippers are real pockets, about big enough for a smart phone."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Good quality, fits well",5,"This jacket is very comfortable, it has plenty of pockets. It's a little baggy, but that's the way I wanted it to be. I bought another jacket that fits more slim. there are a couple of fake pockets that I was a little disappointed with. I thought they were real in the photo, but I didn't really read the description, so it's probably my fault. Either way the jackets are still good, I like the way they feel and look. I'm keeping this one for more of a dress jacket. The other one I'm using more for work, or times when I'm not worried about it possibly getting dirty. No need to post pictures, it's exactly what the page shows"
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Different than unexpected but a good purchase,4,"First I'll mention this isn't made in the US therefore the zipper is on the left however it's not a women's cut as many Americans think. The zipper on the right for men is just a US thing.Got it to replace a similar style jacket for fall and is warm enough for that purpose (I live in Northern Maine)I got the xl and fits pretty close to what I expected. It pulls just a bit around my shoulders if I say hug someone, but my spine is curved and tends to add extra width so it fits as it should for the size.Biggest draw back is the side pockets are shallow so can't really put much in there without risk of falling out. Everything else is fine. I did think it was more of a windbreaker but it's closer to denim.Goes down to waist so wearing a shirt that can be tucked in but isn't will show.Would recommend!"
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Very nice quality,5,"I am 5'10"" and weight 240 and I ordered a 3x to make sure it was going to be big enough since most of the time things seem to run small.  This jacket however, seems to be made to fit us Americans.  I can wear a hooded sweatshirt under it and still feel fine.  For just normal cool weather with just a shirt I could have ordered a 2X and it would have fit just fine.  Yes the zipper is on the wrong side for a men's jacket, but I am a man and I can adapt just fine.  I think it is a good value and recommend it."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Not men’s jacket.,1,I ordered xtra large because that’s the size I’ve been for a long time. It fits just a little snug across the chest. Otherwise I’m very happy with the material and weight. I would be able to wear this while driving several hours.Update I found that the zipper and flap is on the female side. Not a mans jacket!Update: jacket is a women’s not men’s. Zipper is on the wrong side.
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Size too big,1,"I thought I did my measurements right but I guess not. I ordered a M but it was way too big to I replaced it with a S. I guess a size S was better but it seemed still too big. I guess it wasn't made to fit the body outline of an Asian physique. I'm 136 lbs and 5'5. When I put on the small. It look really baggy, the sleeve around the arm just flapping.. I had other cargo jackets for example ""Superdry size M"" and it wrap great around my body and arms. So how does my previous jacket from Superdry size M which was a great fit so much different from this Eklentson in size S?"
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Isn't as good as the pictures are,3,"first off I may not have found the package if they hadn't sent a picture of where it was at. Second reading most of the reviews before I bought mine I decided to go with the xl size, too big all around the waist end comes down past my pants pockets, waist and chest much too baggy. and third it zips up as for a woman's coat (isn't there two sexes I china). and last the pictures you're looking at makes it look real nice, it's okay not real good. I keep it if for no other reason it'll make a good work jacket."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,My favorite Jacket for fall,5,"Fits me perfectly. I am 5'10, 160lbs and a 30inch waist and ordered a medium if that helpsThe length of the jacket is great, i wish the sleeves were a touch longer but it is great.It is also warmer than I expected. I bought for fall season here but I feel like I could wear a fleece or sweatshirt under it to make it be warm down into the 30F range.Also seems like good quality and makes me look cooler than I actually am. I get invited to a lot more parties when I wear this jacket. Love it!"
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Sharp looking, comfortable jacket",5,"I ordered an XL and it fit me exactly as I wanted it to.  I'm 6'2"" 200#, with long arms.  The sleeves go just beyond my wrist bone and the shoulders are roomy enough to let me cross my arms very comfortably.  I have a 36"" waist (no beer belly) and the knitted rib hem closes up fairly tight around me. Quality is very good - I really like the cotton shell and the metal zippers.  It's not super warm, but it's a good spring/fall jacket and a sweater fits under it very well.  Very pleased with this purchase."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Cool,4,"EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Lightweight Multi Pockets Zip Front Stand Collar Military Jackets Windbreaker: Unique, masculine, military somewhat but since dark blue, not to Army looking. Stylish, not for winter, but thin- so better for Spring or Fall.  Very light weight, but tough. Love the many pockets and that hands can go in when walking, standing for hand warmth. Fits a wee but tight so I ordered one extra size up. I normally wear a L, but I ordered XL and after washing in machine, it fits perfect.  Wish they had a second version for winter, thicker and or a water repellent version."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Good Buy,4,"This jacket is great! I needed a black jacket for my job and this works perfect. Had a lot of pockets and is light weight.The one thing I don't like, is that when I washed it, I can see all these fuzziness and lint stuck to it and it won't come off...also seems to pill easily.But other than that it's a good jacket.So I'm a female, 5'8"", 155lbs and the small is still a bit big on me."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Great looking jacket, at an affordable price",5,"The material quality and overall construction is great. The zippers and buttons work well. This jacket is heavier than a wind breaker, but not heavy enough on its own for snow. I put the jacket size as running slightly small due to the chest sizing. It's probably just me, but i found the jacket a little tight in the shoulders when reaching. I do have relatively broad shoulders. I wear a size XL t-shirt and got a size XL jacket. I dont think going up to XXL would help, as the rest of the jacket fitment is great. I would buy this jacket again."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Runs long, fits perfectly otherwise",5,"This was a gift. The recipient loves the jacket and it looks sharp on him. The fit is perfect except it's too long for an average sized man (5'11""); we thought it would sit at the waist but it hits at upper thigh. The detail and workmanship are top quality, the fabric is sturdy. The zipper, as the seller noted, is on the opposite side from what American men are used to, but that's not a defect or an inconvenience. The price was very reasonable for such a quality garment."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Nice build, but too small. Serious shrinkage after 1st wash.",2,"Very well built, little small, sleeze length is short for the size. After 1st wash shrunk at least a size and a half. Now way too small to wear."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Zipper on the left (like a ladies jacket),3,"Light weight jacket. See customer photos, they give you a better idea how this jacket will fit. The fit is more like how a shirt would fit, not loose. It is a nice jacket. It is just not a heavy jacket. The weight is more like a denim jacket. Also does zip from the left. Unusual for a man’s jacket."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,It's an ok Jacket (small size),4,"The material looks like carhart, but a little softer.I've got the small size, and it fits just right, but if I get a hoodie under than it's tight in the upper side. I got the brown color, but it doesn't look like in the picture, in the pictures looks way nicer than it is.I don't regret getting it, but it doesn't have the wow factor like I was hoping."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Seaming came apart.,1,"I really liked the style and the look of the jacket however, after only 2 weeks of wearing it the seaming began to come apart and I now have a hole in two separate places. On the sleeve and the hole. Though it looks good, I must say that its low quality."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Looks completely different.,1,Looks really good on the picture but is another thing when is on your hands lol poor quality and size is a little bit bigger and looks different. 👎
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Pretty good quality for the price!,5,I had been looking at similar jackets in stores and didn't really wanna pay over 100 dollars for one...So I rolled the dice on this one on Amazon and was pleasantly surprised! Just as nice as all the ones I passed on at the stores! Definitely will get good use out of this jacket!
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Nice style, but questionable quality.",3,"there's a pocket on the inside of the jacket, as well as various pockets on the outside. The inside pocket, however, fell apart before a single wash. It seems the stitching was incomplete on this particular jacket. Without this defect, the jacket would be 5 stars, as I've yet to find another issue in having it since the beginning of September. It acts as a windbreaker and is very warm, and I like that there's no breeze coming in through my sleeves or bottom of the jacket."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Awesome Jacket, just like new after a year later",5,"I have had this jacket for months, I have even put some iron on patches on it and it has held up just fine. I ordered my own size (large) and it fit just as expected. I would have to say this is one of the best amazon purchases I have ever made. I have tried on other name brand jackets and I would say they feel so much cheaper than this one for a marked up price. Overall, this is the best jacket I've ever owned, I would reccomend 100%.Edit: after more than a year the jacket still fits fine, the zippers work perfectly, and there are no signs of wear and tear. Would rate 10 stars if I could"
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,IMPRESSIVE QUALITY.  EXCELLENT STYLE!,5,"I ordered this jacket 1-size larger due to several posts.  It was too large, however I was impressed with its style and quality.  I sent the larger oversized jacket back, and reordered it to my normal size.  It fit perfectly!  Well made, stylish and I love the length!  Would highly recommend!"
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Sloppy sewing, liner separating from seam",3,"Worn casually maybe 20 times, not any reason to split open. If you look you can see where the sewing actually missed the liner entirely missing the material.  Not acceptable."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Wrong side for the zipper,3,"Great jacket, good color, too long for a bomber jacket,  too loose fitting, good quality, comfortable but I sent it back because the zipper is on the wrong side, it zips like a woman's jacket, not cool.  Otherwise I would have kept it."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Great buy - Fast Devilery,5,Bought it for my 14 year old and he loves it.  We received it sooner that we has been told at time of purchase.  The stitching was superb and the details were better than I expected.  Well made.
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Pretty Nice Jacket,4,The jacket is pretty nice. I would recommend getting a size larger then you usually take as it runs small. The one thing I don't like is the zipper and snaps work from the left instead of the right like most men's garments. If it was the correct way I might have given it 5 stars.
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Solid quality, fits to size.",5,Recently ordered this jacket for myself.  I'm 5'9 175.  The reviews and description led me to believe these coats run small so I went ahead and got a large.  I really think I should have got a medium.  The large fits with enough room for layering when it gets colder so I plan on keeping the slightly larger than needed version.  Highly recommend!
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Very good jacket for the money, just order a size larger than you normally wear",5,Jacket is well made and nice looking.  Just make sure you order a size larger than you normally wear because the size shown on the ordering chart is smaller than you would think.  I normally wear size XL but for this jacket I needed a XXL size which fits just right.
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Very Good Field Jacket,5,"I am a landscape photographer and I do not carry backpacks. I travel light with no more than three lenses. This jacket perfectly met my needs. It is a good weight for warmth without the bulk. The pockets are plentiful, the right size for glasses, filters, and a lens or two."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,watch out for return shipping.,2,"not as expected. Yes, did zip on wrong side but I have another jacket like that and it's ok. But I decided to return for refund and would have been required to ship back to China (where it's made) at a cost of $45. Not expecting that.So I donated to clothing bin."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Nice Jacket,5,I wanted a military type jacket as I liked the one I was issued while in the military.Its not exactly  the same as there does not appear to have buttons for a colder weather liner but that is no big deal to me. Jacket is perfect by itself but if your going to Alaska I Would layer it with long johns. I may buy another one if they come in camo.
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,very nice!,5,"i have a really hard time buying on line but this time i hit the jack pot,im 5'11 260 lbs and i ordered 2xl it fits perfect! no lie! i cant believe it! it looks sharp too. and for 50 bucks you cant go wrong"
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Good quality,4,"This coat seems very well made so far (have had it a couple of days now).The length is great, but the shoulders and chest are a little bit loose.I purchased a 2xl based on the seller's size chart, because I'm a pretty big guy (6'5"", and about 260lbs.)I think the XL would have been a more tailored fit, but I don't mind it being baggy, so I'll just keep the one I have now."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,A little too much slack in arms,5,"Nice jacket but a little too light, this wouldn't be my first choice for long term use in the cold/snow. The fit, overall was fine except for the sleeves. Also, beware the buttons. They're heavy and weird, and the jackets a little too flashy for my taste honestly."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,High quality,4,"It is a very high quality jacket for the money. The only drawback is that the zipper zips on the wrong side, what is usually considered the side for ladies. At least in my generation."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Zipper pull tag is on the left,4,"Jacket fit prefect as well sung fit..the only catch. The zipper pull tag is on the left. Instead on the right. I wonder if jacket they selling is woman.  Because,  my girlfriend stated all buttons and zipper tag are on the left."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Was shipped from China, but did get in Michigan in about two weeks.",5,"Fit and quality were very nice. I bought an XL, I am 5 foot ten 190lbs broad shouldered with a 34 inch waist and it fits me quit well if that helps anyone. Has a left hand zipper that seems a little funky when your used to right handed, but I can live with that.  Material is more like Carhart. Not for artic cold but will be great for fall/spring temps or shorter trips out in the cold. Pretty happy with it for the price though.."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Fits well after a wash,5,"When delivered this jacket was quite stiff and didn't really fit well.  After a spin through the wash it loosened up and fits quite nicely now.  I'm a physically fit person so it's a benefit for me, but the jacket is snug around the midsection, so not sure I would recommend if you've got a belly to accommodate."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Nice jacket of you like the style.,4,"Ordered grey but it is more a dark brown. Other reviewers noted the same thing. Rated thin because it is advertised as lightweight which it is.Like this jacket though.Good fit. One odd thing: zipper is on the left, typical of women's clothes."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Great look and style, not meant for cold days.",5,"Loved the way it looked and it fit to my surprise. I thought it would be a bit too large but, I got it in XL and it fit me. I’m a 5’8 healthy kind of guy and it fit me. I would say, not the best for windy nights in the desert. Pro tip, put a fluffy jacket underneath preferably one with a hood and you’ll do fine."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,You get what you pay for,2,"Cheaply made material, with little insulating factor.  Doesn’t quite look like what was in the picture. The material is very thin and doesn’t keep you warm. The only positive is that it fits well."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Great Light weight jacket for chilly to fair weather,5,This is a nice jacket for weather for those days where it's too cold to go without a jacket but not cold enough for something heavier. My husband also gets hot under most jackets but he loves this one
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,"Very good quality, reasonably priced.",5,This jacket fit perfectly. I ordered one size larger (XL) than my normal size (L) per other reviews. This is a great coat with the cuffs and waist that keep the cold out. This jacket looks great with plenty of pockets (some with zippers and some with flaps). There's an inside pocket that comfortably holds a smart phone. I am very pleased with this jacket as it's very reasonably priced with very good quality.
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Worthwhile,5,"This jacket is quite nice! It is light weight yet very warm. I was pleasantly surprised. The fit is great and stylish. It is probably not going to last five years, but a couple anyway. 5'4"" 130 lbs ordered a large. Fits a bit loose, but that's how I like it. Patches in the photo are my own additions."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Surprising Decent Jacket,4,"I went in not expecting too much from this jacket, and at first, was underwhelmed. The front pocket interior lining is weak, and started ripping on the first day.But since then, I've had zero problems with the coat. It looks nice, fits my somewhat  burley build well, and works for what I need it too. Asides from the pocket lining, I've had absolutely zero problems with this product, and have started wearing it almost daily."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Not a flattering silhouette,3,"The pic of the jacket makes it seem to have a rakish, flattering silhouette. It’s actually very straight and fits kind of “sacky”. Too bad I was looking forward to liking it."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Nice Jacket,5,Got this as a gift for my tall and slender fit son.  He loves it and it looks great to layer .  Awesome purchase for the price too.  Had to wash it recently and still looks great
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Looks Great but Runs Small,5,I love the way this jacket looks and feels.  It is very well made.  But I would order one size larger than you think you need.  They seem to run a little on the small side.
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Came with hole in it.,2,"I would have given 5 stars but the new jacket I recieved came with a large hole in the left pocket.  I wore it for the first time today, cutting the tag,  and it is past the return date to exchange for another so I am stuck with a ""holy"" jacket. -_-"
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Great jacket,5,Bought it for my grandson. He’s  6’3 and loves it!
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Pleasantly Surprised,4,"I wasn't expecting much with this purchase, but overall it's been a great light jacket. Looks very stylish, works with a lot of outfits, is comfortable and practical. My only knock against quality is that my outside pocket on the left had a small rip in it when it arrived, but it was easy enough to fix. The jacket was a little tight in my shoulders as well, but not enough that it's uncomfortable to wear. Excellent purchase!"
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Great Jacket!,5,"I'm 6'3, 328lbs. I bought 2xl. I need to lose 10-15lbs for it to look/feel they way I want, but I'll be there in now time. Really like the look/feel of this jacket. I'll be waterproofing it for winter!"

EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Didn't fit as in description,4,"I loved the material this product was made of.  I thought this product was made for winter and it doesn't keep you warm unless you have layers under it.  It also didn't fit as described, it was smaller than expected."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Top-most button came off in wash,3,"Washed my jacket when I got it and the top-right button at the neck came off. True to size, though I got a size too big since I winged it rather than actually measured chest and such. Looks like a good jacket otherwise, but losing a button the day I get the jacket is annoying as can be; not to mention it's one of those metal buttons and not a genuine button, so no sewing back on."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,So smart!,5,"I look so great in this!  It doesn't seem to matter my arms are freakishly short or my belly is the size of a woman's who is in her 14th month of pregnancy, this jacket looks very good on me.  The buttons really sell it!"
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Love it and glad I didn't go with the size chart.,4,I love this jacket. Thankfully I went with my instincts and ignored the sizing charts. Color perfect and it fits perfect. I'm between 5'8 and 5'9 and I weigh a 185 pounds. I ordered a large instead of the medium that the charts suggested.  Go with what you normally wear it'll save ya time. I don't ever give 5 stars cuz nothing and noone is perfect.
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Careful with the Size,1,"I should have fit a large jacket, but the chest was just a hair too tight. I returned it and got the XL and it fit even tighter around the chest the the Large. Very inconsistent construction, so be careful when ordering. I am going with a better brand. (not an ad, so I won't disclose what)"
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,GREAT jacket for the money,5,If you are looking for a winter jacket this is not the one you want. It's not really insulated. It fits really well though and was WAY nicer than I expected.

EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Great Jacket,5,"I am very satisfied with this jacket.  So far, only problem seems to be the zipper not catching quickly, but I have only tried it on and it remains to be seen if this will be a problem or not.  Jacket looks excellent and has a nice amount of conveniently located pockets."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Order It A Size Bigger,5,"I wear an XL, but I saw that everyone said to get it bigger. I ordered it XXL and it fits perfect. I am 5'9"" and 140lbs."

EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,very nice for the price,5,"I love this jacket. I love in a fairly warm place, so its perfect for early mornings when its just a little chilly. It is thin, so would not be great if you live in a place with very cold winters. The sizing it a bit off, I normally wear a mens medium, and I ordered a small. Which fits great. The only issue is the sleeves are just slightly too long. But that is most likely due to me having shorter arms and not the jacket itself."
EKLENTSON Military Jackets For Men Bomber Jacket Men Jacket Army Men Army Green Jacket Fall Jackets Men,Runs small,4,Jacket looks great but runs smaller than listed. Got a 3XL and it was pretty tight in the shoulders and waist. Not meant for broad frames

"TOTNMC Men's Casual Coats for men Slim Fit Softshell Jacket Winter Fall Jacket Mens Windbreakers Bomber Jacket,Grey,X-Large",Fits perfect,5,"Nothing to dislike about, I use it for work and on my days off. Matches my uniform, I can't wear loose clothing cause it'll get in the way when I'm doing work."
"TOTNMC Men's Casual Coats for men Slim Fit Softshell Jacket Winter Fall Jacket Mens Windbreakers Bomber Jacket,Grey,X-Large",Perfect for the price.,5,Love the color.
"TOTNMC Men's Casual Coats for men Slim Fit Softshell Jacket Winter Fall Jacket Mens Windbreakers Bomber Jacket,Grey,X-Large",Awful all around. Do not buy,1,"First off this ""Large"" is like a children's small. Thin cheap material. The fact the seller even put the words bomber jacket in there is insulting. This jacket is pure trash"
"TOTNMC Men's Casual Coats for men Slim Fit Softshell Jacket Winter Fall Jacket Mens Windbreakers Bomber Jacket,Grey,X-Large",Attractive Jacket!😎👌,5,LUV the Fit!Caint get Enuff of It!
"TOTNMC Men's Casual Coats for men Slim Fit Softshell Jacket Winter Fall Jacket Mens Windbreakers Bomber Jacket,Grey,X-Large",,0,"After reading the reviews I was quite concerned that it would be too small.  It took awhile to get here from China, & when it arrived today, 3 wks. earlier than expected, I noticed that the package was very small  for a man's XXL winter jacket.  We took it out of the envelope, shook it out & it fit my husband perfectly, even with  a little room  for a long sleeved Tshirt underneath.  He's 5'10'' tall/220 lbs. so the XXL fit him just right.  A very nice jacket for $50 bucks!"
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",50 Degrees was bone chillingly painful but this was the perfect solution,5,Warm and cozy. Being Cali born for 25 years n moving to DC was a shock to my body come winter time. 50 Degrees was bone chillingly painful but this was the perfect solution! even when it was 20 degrees outside it felt like a nice 70 inside the jacket which turned my 6am car warm up from a near death experience on a daily basis to a walk on the beach on a warm summer (cali) day. Totally worth the incredibly high price tag.
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Awesome!,5,"Runs slightly small. I am 5 ft8 165pounds and I like a tight fit so I got a medium and it fits perfectly.  Super warm in 25° weather.  Haven’t tried in the rain though. One thing that’s unexpect ed is that it jet black looks awesome.  Jacket has a much more European tailored look than the American jackets which I really like. Best winter jacket I have ever owned. UPDATE- I see some people taking a star off for the zipper getting stuck. This does happen rarely but it’s no biggie , takes 2extra seconds to get unstuck!"
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Some are fake,2,"So, I'm not reviewing 1 star because Amazon is taking care of it but CHECK TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT JACKET. I originally ordered the silver but decided I wanted black instead, but the jacket was AMAZING,  the marmot stockholm is honestly the best jacket I've ever worn. However, the ""replacement "" I got was not at all the same jacket, not even close. None of the softness, different style, heavier, way cheaper feeling. It does have marmot labels but no new tag, and it has definitely been washed a few times.  It might be a knock off. So yeah,  the real deal is the best jacket ever but be diligent"
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Extremely warm and quality coat,5,"This coat will keep you warm in any weather. It is a bit on the puffy side, but one of the warmest jackets I have ever owned. The quality is top notch with very nice zippers. There is a cord to tighten the waist are hidden in the front pockets, which I thought was rather innovative.Sometimes the zipper can get caught on the inside lining, but not anything serious enough to complain about."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Pretty,5,"And fits well. I would buy a size larger than you need though to make room for sweaters and bulky shirts or if you have broad shoulders, like me."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Jacket is very warm,5,"Warm coat, bought this jacket for my husband and right now it is very cold in Chicago . My husband stated he is warm in this jacket . Very well made for the very cold temperatures at -19 below zero."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700","Warm, comfortable, stylish",5,"This is a really warm and nice jacket. I can skip the usual layers and just wear this over my top. I live in the NY region, this jacket is great for that. However, when the temperature hits closer to 50, this feels a tad too warm. Not complaining, this is a solid down jacket."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Runs small. Not enough down on the arms,3,Chest and back have plenty of down the arms lack a bit. The sizing runs small. Fits well with a t-shirt but I struggle with a hoodie or sweatshirt under. The reviewers suggest ordering a size bigger which is true but I’m normally a 2xl and that’s the biggest size they sell. It seems warm enough with a sweatshirt but restricts your movement some.
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Perhaps the best down jacket I have ever owned.,5,"Perhaps the best down jacket I have ever owned.  Everything is just perfect.  I chose size small and the fit is perfect.  I am 5' 8"" and 155 lb.  Thank you Marmot for having a sensible sleeve length. I had a Marmot jacket in Small size with sleeve length 34 inches (only monkeys can wear it without alteration).  I want to buy it in white if I can find one.  I really look forward to wear it and go out side.  This is a keeper.  Really.  Just get it."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Like being wrapped in a cloud.,5,"This is a perfect winter jacket. Light, warm and great features like micro fleece on the wrists and a large hood. I relish the days when it drops below 20 degrees F so I can wear this jacket!"
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Great winter jacekt,5,"Pros: iight weight, yet warm; very comfortable around neck; sleeve cuffs keep wind out; good pockets; quality zipper that doesn't jam.Con: silver color not a great choice to avoid stains in active use, but looks a lot better than the white outfit this guy in the photo is wearing."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Sleeves were short,1,"I had to return it. I wear a small in North Face and went with a medium in this one to allow more room for layering. I don't know if I got a defective one, but the sleeves were two inches too short, maybe three inches. I'm 5'9"", 155 lbs, and wasn't close to getting it to work. My 5'7"" son tried it and the sleeves were far too short for him too.I didn't order a replacement since I needed a jacket sooner and had to go to a local store to find one that fit. (All mediums and most smalls fit from the local store, so hopefully this one was just a glitch in their process.)"
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Mala calidad.,1,"El tamaño es perfecto, solo que espere que fuera tan gruesa como se ve en la foto, y no lo es.La calidad es regular, se le salen las plumas o lo que sea que trae de relleno. Salen en todo momento, y la tela de las muñecas no es buena.No lo recomiendo."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Not very warm and zipper sticks to backing inside.,1,"A nice looking coat but I doubt it will hold up very well.  I tried it on a 35 degree breezy day and it did not keep me warm, plus the zipper kept binding to the backing inside the coat."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Not that thick!,3,"This is a great jacket with great material but it is way 2 then for a 200 price tag. I like the look and fill but thought for the price it would have a thicker fill. It’s just needs more filling to make it thicker but over all nice, not that great for 200 in my option I’d pay 100 for this jacket just because it is nice."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700","Packaging en mal estado, sucio y semi abierto.",2,"No tengo quejas sobre la calidad del producto, pero si sobre la forma en que fue acondicionada para viajar y entregarse.  He recibido la jacket en una simple bolsa plástica blanca con el logo Amazon, la bolsa estaba arañada seguramente se había atorado en algúna pasarela, además tenía marcas de suciedad y las cintas con las que se había pegado estaban parcialmente desplegadas, por lo cual se apreciaba parte de la jacket a simple vista sin necesidad de abrir dicho paquete.  Cuando extraje la jacket de la cobertura note algunas manchas de roce, es decir  por haber estado expuesta. No se debe entregar así un articulo que costo usd 220 tax Inc.!"
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Great for Chicago Winters,5,"This coat is very warm, and comfortable.  The hood is a little large, and I should have ordered a size smaller than I usually wear.  I'm 5'6 1/2, 155 lbs, and the medium is a pretty loose on me. But it makes Chicago winters more bearable."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Not worth it.,1,"People that thought up this coat, we're just worried about maxing price point. Giving you so little that they make the most on every jacket. I expect more than a garbage bag with feathers."

"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Zipper is not smooth.,2,"Zipped is really hard to slide to open/close. I worry that if I pull it any harder, the zipper knob is going to break.And I'm not sure if I'll be able to close it when I'm wearing gloves and cold. As a result I use it for gardening,instead of the mountains. There were cheaper options for a backyard jacket."

"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Looks very nice on the picture,2,"Unfortunately when I got this this Jacket, I saw feathers were sticking out in quite few places, so that says that once I put it on in a few weeks I'll get feathers all over these jacket. I already had this experience with cheaper jackets , but didn't expect to see it on the jacket in the $200 price range. Looks very nice on the picture, but quality is pretty bad."

It's warm, cozy, fits well, packs down small, and fits under a modern athletic fit parka without compressing the down insulation! I found the sizing to be exact, not at all restrictive but maintaining a nice athletic fit. It comes down to the middle of my butt. The XL fits me perfectly. I'm 6'2"" and 240 Lbs. I wear a mens 48 long suit jacket and dress shirts with an 18"" neck, 34-35 sleeve. In jeans I'm a 36 waist/32 inseam. I hope posting my measurements helps anyone who is unsure of the fit."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Feathers galore,1,"I purchased the Marmot Stockholm Puffer Jacket as a gift for son. In matter of 2 weeks time, a galore of feathers were seeping through the jacket's material. Abundance of feathers were on the car's driver seat, my wool coat, and all around the seat/floor of the car. We don't own any pets. I thought it was coming from my car's seat. Since every time I used the lint roller to remove feathers from my coat (the back area}, more would appear when I would get back into the car. I went to the car dealer to check it out and the service dept. assured me that it wasn't the car seat. They don't us feathers as a filling. Unknowingly it was coming from my son's jacket. Thereafter, my son said he became aware of  the feathers coming from his ""Marmot"" jacket. We share the car. My son wanted to own this jacket since it's trending now. Prior to this mess, He said he liked the fit and he didn't get cold while wearing it in 30 degrees temperature. As of this review, I'm in the process of returning the  Marmot Stockholm Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700 and getting a full refund. This coat cost $275. For this amount, it should not be affecting me, especially when I'm out and about, the car, and while my son is wearing it. I'm giving it (1) STAR."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Terrible experience,1,"I received this jacket in my mail and it didn't look anything like in the picture. I had ordered the Medium Jet Black but it looked like a beaten up black. It's hood was missing, the jacket had multiple small holes with down feathers coming out. The jacket looked very dirty and it had few tissue papers in its side pockets. The inside label was twisted and torn like it was machine washed a few times. I was seriously disappointed with the state of jacket and immediately applied for refund/return."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Poor design,2,Poorly designed. The face guard on the hood doesn't close properly. And the front zipper always gets caught in the fabric when you unzip. Disappointing because I like that it's goose down and the cuffs fit really nice to keep the wind out.
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700","Stylish, durable, and versatile",5,"I bought this jacket almost a year ago from another website and I am very pleased. As a college student in a cold, northernWisconsin university, I needed a jacket that would keep out the elements while being durable, stylish, and weather-resistant. After a long, 5-year search for the ""perfect one,"" I bought the Stockholm jacket. The outer fabric seemed a little thin but ended up being more durable than I had anticipated. On a little side note, this jacket has a double layer on the inside of the collar, which is also down-filled, but I have not seen any reviews that mentioned that. The zipper does not catch a whole lot but will occasionally do so; also, the down almost always comes out through the stitching. However, it doesn't come out a lot. The down may shift around somewhat but otherwise stays in the same general spot, and speaking of the down, the jacket could use more in the bicep and forearm areas as well as the shoulders. As a whole, the jacket is just the right loft while not being too bulky. It can be layered over two of my other jackets without making me look like an astronaut. I would not layer anything over it unless you need the added warmth of a parka, and even then, I would not go for a puffy parka. It is also wind- and water-resistant. Overall, I am very satisfied. The sizing does run a size large; I would order a size smaller."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",Just what we need for Alaska weather,5,If you want a coat to keep you warm in Alaska weather -35 below ZERO this is the jacket. It was perfect!!

"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",,0,"I just received the jacket today.The jacket looks really nice, it's too bad it arrived ripped right above the left hand pocket.It's leaking down & feather everywhere.I thought it was weird already when the package that came in seemed like it was opened once already.That being said after examining the hole, I realized the material used for the jacket outer wall was a super thin plastic. A supermarket plastic bag is thicker than this.This jacket is very light weight, but it won't be durable, these plastic bags will rip too easily being so thin.It's a single layer plastic, I don't see any other layer protecting the down feather.I'm not sure I can recommend this product, the quality is very questionable."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",,0,"Had bought a Marmot with 700 fill 2-3 years ago from a retail store and it was amazing so I was expecting this one to be similar. However, the bottom back, top chest area, and the head area are not as filled as the rest of the jacket. Today was an especially windy day in Toronto and I could definitely feel the cold on my lower back area. Not sure if I'm just unlucky and got a flawed product or if all the products are the same but, I'm a little disappointed. Other than that its a very good jacket, the hand area has an soft extra layer on the inside which prevent the wind from entering which is nice since my old one didn't have it. If the jacket was evenly filled I would have given it a solid 5 stars but over time, those skimped areas will only get worse through time and I feel I will need to buy another jacket next year so I'm gonna have to deduct a couple stars. I would probably spend a little extra for a better brand next time, or at the least by from a retail store to try them out before I buy again. Gl and stay warm ppl."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",,0,"These are not meant for Canadian winters. I wish Marmot would include a temperature rating on this jacket. It might be OK for -10C, but it certainly won't handle the -30C that most of us Canadians have grown accustomed to."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",,0,"Amazing jacket ... Unzipped you stay comfortable . All that is needed is a t-shirt when zipped up.

"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",,0,"The fabric on this jacket is unbelievably thin. It’s really thiner than the usual winter jacket that one would think about... I don’t think it would last long (plus, it came damaged with a little cut on it), so had to return it. Would not recommend it."
"Marmot Men's Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket, Fill Power 700",,0,"Can't say to much because I got this winter jacket in July, so no chance to try it out in the colder weather. It feels like it has lots of down and should do the trick for colder days. We live in southeast BC so we will soon be able to use this type of jacket. I have read a lot of reviews and comments about this jacket and feel it will live up to its reputation."

Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,"Warm jacket, feels great, nostalgic look.",5,"I rarely shop for clothes online--especially as a 2XL guy.  You don't know if it's going to fit, really. I ordered this jacket from Amazon and it was perfect!  Perfectly fit.You remember the sherpa jackets of the early 80s?  Yeah, this gave me all the feels.  I wanted something like this in high school, bought a corduroy version in the early 2000s which I grew out of, and now this version, sort of an 80s look, is back again!  So I was happy to be able to order something in my size.It's warm, and is perfect for shoulder seasons like a cool Fall, cool Spring, and a mild Winter.  But it's 20F outside right now and I'm okay going in and out of vehicles and buildings. I'd want something warmer if I were going to stay outside longer.  But you know this is perfect for campfires, being outside in cooler weather.I love the way it looks on me.  I don't feel fat, and the cut of the jacket actually accentuates the upper body, everything else looks proportional.  It's a very masculine jacket if that's the look you want, and you get a lot of compliments from friends.  All in all, a great purchase!  Worth every penny.The Best clothing purchase I've made online."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,I'd Give This Jacket 10 Stars,5,"Quality out the ying yang.  Arrived in pristine condition and packaged at the factory.  Had NOT been triedon and played around with ( other words sent back by somebody ).  This was a plus.  This jacket is made justlike the Wrangler jeans,  tough and durable.  The stitching is perfect,  craftsmanship immaculate .This jacket is heavy duty and very warm when the temp is in the 20's.  I cannot find any fault with this nicejacket.  If I could,  I would tell you.  If you like Wrangler jeans,  you'll like this.  The fit,  perfect.  Order thesize that you use.  This jacket is exactly as described and more.  I'm telling you,  this jacket is none lessthan 100% quality.  The buttons are metal and are put on tight.  Again,  nothing wrong with this jacket.Worth the asking price.  The lining inside the jacket is put in right,  no sagging,  sleeves and all.  It will fitwith comfort over a thick flannel winter shirt,  also machine washable just like the jeans,  with noshrinkage..."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,This is the one to get,5,"This is a great jacket. It is made of quality materials, especially, at this price ($59.99). It is a very warm jacket. It seems to run small. I'm between a L, and, XL on shirts/jackets, depending on the cut. I ordered the XL. It does fit, but certainly isn't loose. It would be uncomfortable to wear any garment under it that had any substance to it. Shirts, up to heavy flannel, would be fine. Also, for me(5'10"", 215 lbs), the jacket feels a little short, but, sleeves are fine. I prefer a jacket to land at hip length. This jacket hits just below the belt line. I would definitely order a size bigger than your usual jacket that has a tailored fit. As an example of cut, I also ordered the Wrangler Rustic sherpa denim jacket (Truckers jacket). It is not as heavy of a jacket as this one. I ordered it in L, and, it is actually loose on me, but, still fits very comfortably. Bottom line is, if you get the right fit on this fairly heavy weight jacket, you should be very happy with it. I ordered 3 different Wrangler denim jackets, 2 sherpa, 1 unlinked, and, all 3 are great. I am very happy with my purchases."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Finally found a trucker jacket that I really like!,5,"I've always liked this style of jacket but have not been able to find my size - XL Tall - anywhere locally.  In the past, I tried an XXL (not tall), but it was too loose in the body and the length was still too short for me.  I have also worn unlined trucker jackets, and they don't provide any warmth in cooler weather.  When I found this Wrangler jacket on Amazon, in my size, with the choice of fleece or blanket lining, I was hooked.  I ordered one with the blanket lining, as I prefer a less bulky lining that leaves room for wearing a sweater under the jacket, plus I like the look of the corduroy collar and red lining.  A couple of days later, the jacket arrived on my doorstep.Overall, I'm very pleased with this jacket!  It has enough arm and body length for me, and the blanket lining does indeed provide some warmth without being bulky, perfect for spring and fall weather.  It is not warm enough for winter without a sweater or fleece under the jacket.  As other reviewers have noted, it runs a bit big:  I have plenty of room in the torso to wear a sweater comfortably under the jacket.  Before buying this jacket, I saw that some reviewers complained about the material being too thin.  Mine is not made out of the heaviest denim out there, but the benefit of somewhat lighter denim (and it's not thin or poor quality by any means) is that the jacket lets me move more easily.  I had a trucker jacket once that was made from heavy denim, and no matter how many times I wore and washed it, it was stiff until the day I wore through the elbows.  The blanket lining is soft and provides warmth without being bulky or itchy.The only nit for me is that I have to undo the cuff snaps before removing the jacket.  With the cuffs snapped, they are snug enough that I can't pull my (large) hands out of the sleeves.  The upside of this is that this means my body heat will not escape as quickly from the cuffs.  To be clear, the cuffs are not uncomfortable when closed.  Also, the inside of the cuffs are lined with corduroy, so you can be stylish and roll the cuffs once to show the corduroy, or just leave the cuffs down and unsnapped if you want a loose fit at your wrists."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,amazing jacket!,5,"for the money i was honestly expecting to get a lesser quality coat. well color me impressed.  lets cover first impressions. first thing i noticed was how heavy and stiff it was. i have no idea what weight denim they are using but it is atleast twice as thick as any of my jeans (most of which are wrangler jeans) and the fabric itself is stiff. borderlining on raw denim stiff and feel.next was the stitching. there is some single stitching here and there but by and large youre looking  at double stitch on 80 percent of the coat especially across high stress points like the shoulders and pockets. meaning this thing isnt gonna pull itself apart any time soon. built to lastnext was the buttons. oh my god are these things strong and stiff. im sure they will loosen up and become easier to use as the fabric wears in but it actually started to turn my fingers raw and hurt after unbottoning the 3rd or 4th button.  i dont know if its this way across the board with all of these coats but it was like that with mine. i mean these things are on there theres no way these are going to fail any time soon. the buttons themselves are made of a solid metal that feels thick and sturdy. i could consider this a gripe just because it does quite a bit of effort to manipulate them but id rather them be on there really tough than for them to be all loose and fail after a couple months. even if they dont loosen up with use ill just get stronger fingers. not a gripe for me but it could be one for people with diminished hand strength.next was the sherpa lining. and this is really where my only gripe is with the coat. the sherpa does not extend into the sleeves. it covers the chest, shoulders, and back but not the arms. there is another thin soft fabric lining the sleeves so its not just rough denim in there but it would of been nice to have the sherpa all through the coat. but at its price point i cant really knock it. another thing about the sherpa is that its not very soft its pretty course almost feels like real wool thats still on the sheep. only reason i mention it is because i know with a lot of faux wool like sherpa people expect it to be as soft as a babies ass. again doesnt matter to me but just a heads up in case you are expecting it to be super soft.next is fit and feel. i am 5'8 about 170lbs with a 40 inch chest and slim/fit body type. i ordered a medium and it fits me like a glove. just enough room that i could layer on a light sweater or long sleeve shirt underneath if need be. this is more mild jacket in terms of warmth. it works great for me most days in these very mild virginia winters. except maybe late at night or very early in the morning some days if it drops to or below freezing. if you live somewhere, where there are really heavy cold winters like those in the northern midwest this is not something i would recommend for winter use unless you plan to layer under it. otherwise its a perfect fall/ early spring jacket and depending where you live could be a full 3 season cold weather coat.could not recommend this coat more highly if youre in the market for a reasonably warm denim jacket. looks great. feels great. built to last. honestly cant ask much more than that!"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,"Great fit, great value",5,"I decided that I wanted the Levi Trucker Sherpa jacket until I tried it on.  I am 6’3 and 215 and always wear an XL. The Levi jacket in XL was too short in length and the sleeves were too short and too tight.  The XXL was too big in the body and still short in length. I found the Wrangler jacket on Amazon and after reading reviews, ordered it in XL. I’m very pleased. The jacket fits great and looks great, too. I was a bit concerned that the color would be too dark and am pleased that the “pre-wash” look is just right. And the price was about 40% less than the Levi jacket. I highly recommend it!"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Lightweight Denim,4,"I ordered this jacket to replace an older Wrangler jacket that is wearing out.  This jacket doesn’t look like it will do the job I bought it for.For me, the main problem with this jacket is that the denim is lightweight cloth.  I need a jacket that will stand up to heavy-duty work, like logging or crawling under a pickup to change the oil.  The cloth on this jacket appears like it would tear if it snagged on something.  My old jacket may be getting holes from wear, but it never tore.Some comments that may help you decide:This jacket has six buttons to close the front.  I prefer snaps, but you can’t find a denim jacket with snaps anymore.  The buttons work fine and are strong, metal ones.  The two outside breast pocket flaps are held closed with snaps, which is nice.There is another pocket on the inside, just behind the left breast pocket.  It could come in handy for lots of things.  The two pockets at the lower sides are big enough to stick your cold hands into, but not any too big.The jacket has standard tabs at the bottom hem to allow you to draw the waist tighter by buttoning the tabs to the other button along the hem.  Most denim jackets have these tabs.The lining is nice, but not too thick.  The lining didn’t seem to be of high quality and was sparse enough that I could see the underlying fabric without spreading the pile apart.  This notwithstanding, I tried on the jacket outside in 30-degree weather with a very light breeze and the it was warm enough by itself.  It didn’t require an additional layer to keep me warm.The jacket size seemed to be about right.  I ordered a large-tall and the sleeves were not too long.  The body of the jacket had enough space for me to wear it over a sweater if I chose to.  I am 6-feet tall and weigh 200 pounds.  My shirt size is 15-1/2 x 34.  I would expect that this jacket in large-tall would easily fit someone who weighs up to 220 or so.  The sleeves should still be long enough even if your arms are an inch or so longer than mine.The denim isn’t the color of new blue jeans; it’s more like ""stone-washed"", although not blotchy.  The color is even throughout.  This seems to be a nice jacket if you don’t need it for uses where it will be scraped against rocks or trees.  It just doesn’t look rugged enough for me."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,"Nice Look, Low Quality. Not worth the price or time.",2,"This jacket is MADE IN BANGLADESH.I really tried to like this jacket and I am really disappointed.The tags inside the jacket are placed at the back of the neck and in a way that they stick out and up and are very irritating. A problem easily solved by removing them.The second problem is that while the jacket fits well overall, the wrists are made unproportionately small and fit skin-tight with no adjustment other than to completely unbutton the single button on each sleeve.The major problem is with the quality. The first day wearing the jacket I discovered the pockets (BOTH POCKETS) were not sewn together in the bottoms and were open to the inside of the blanket lining.I recommend saving your money and finding a better product."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Tall size fits right,4,"It is next to impossible for me to find shirts, coats and jackets that fit my long sleeve size.  Many extra large tall sizes I have tried didn't come close to fitting.  This jacket/coat it right in the Extra large/Tall size.  If you have very broad shoulders and long arms this will probably work for you too.  The jacket looks nice, although the denim is not quite as heavy as you would expect from Wrangler.  I also want HEAVY material on the inside of the pockets, and this isn't quite as heavy as I would like.  Too often the inside of the pockets tear out due to very light material being used.  Will have to wait and see how this holds up.  But I like the look and fit and will keep the jacket."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Perfect gift for an outdoor enthusiast.,5,"I bought this for my husband last Christmas. He used to have one like it when we first met, so I thought this would be the perfect gift for the anniversary of the day we met. It fit him well & he wore it through all of last winter (in Wisconsin). Though not warm enough for below zero weather, even with a sweater, it was warm enough to get him through most of what we got last winter. He's a 6 foot guy, with a long body & this jacket came just below his waist. We've found no problems with this jacket & would buy it again."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Finally a western jacket for tall guys,5,"I'm 6'5"", 230lbs and this fits me perfect, especially in regards to sleeve length, which was always a problem with other jackets. It's not too baggy, and not too tight. Literally the perfect extra large tall size. It does not feel as heavy as I thought it would; it's actually a little light, but it looks very sharp and I have already received many compliments on it."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,SIZING IS IN MY OPINION SUBJECT - PERSONALLY USING AMAZON NUMBERS RUNS  S M A L L !,3,"NICE JACKET PERSONALLY I THINK THEY RUN SMALL . MY BIGGEST COMPLIANT IS AMAZON JUST TO SAVE A COUPLE BUCKS TAKES A $ 100.00 JACKET THROWS IT IN A PLASTIC BAG AND THE POST OFFICE WHO COULD CARE LESS JAMS ITS IN A MAIL PARCEL BOX . MY FEELING , THESE WRINKLES AND CREASES ARE NOW PRESSED INTO THE MATERIAL AND WILL ""NOT"" COME OUT.  I HAVE OWNED THIS JACKET IN THE PAST AND THIS REPLACEMENT IS MORE THEN DISAPPOINTING.  BUTTON HOLES WILL TAKE FOREVER TO OPEN AND BECOME USABLE.  IF THIS WAS A 29.99 JACKET I WOULD BE MORE UNDERSTANDING"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Be careful with sizes while shopping online!!!,1,"I always buy 2XL same style jeans jackets (Levi's and others and usually from the USA).I ordered same 2XL and got a jacket of 4-5XL (though writing 2XL on the label...).Sending it back from Cyprus would cost a fortune (around €50)so I gave it to a tailor and had to pay €40 extra.Was it worth all the bother, discomfort, losing time and disappointment???Well, I am not sure.Usually and even if an item isn't perfect, I am trying to be positive with my reviews - not to hurt others...But in this case I feel very very bad."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,A little snug,4,"I initially ordered a XXl.  It was way too big, so I exchanged it for an XL thinking it would fit perfectly.  While it does fit while it is brand new, it is unexpectedly snug under the arms and across the shoulders; the sleeve length is bare minimum.  The snugness is acceptable but I am very concerned about how much it will shrink when it is washed.  I decided to keep the jacket despite my reservations but I will probably have it dry cleaned when it needs cleaning.  The workmanship, material and style were good as expected."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Fiance loves it!,5,Bought this as a birthday gift for my fiance and he loves it. He wears it pretty much all the time. I got the XL and he wears L to XL in shirts (he likes them a little loose not tight) and 38 in pants and it fits him perfect. He had been wanting one and we always went to a store every weekend checking to see if they got them in yet and never did so I ordered it 😁
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Nice color and western look,5,"I like the more uniformly shaded, deep blue denim on this version. It isn't as thick/heavy as the Levi's sherpa jean jackets but has a much more distinctive western look. The fit is old school, somewhat boxy and not form fitting in the least. Be careful - the version on the Wrangler website is similar in color but a more ""modern"" cut. It uses much less material and is tighter - I sent that one back and got this more traditional cut jacket. Very happy with it. Buy your normal jacket size."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,A stylish well-made jacket.,5,"Absolutely love this jacket, high quality workmanship and materials, this jacket is very warm and fantastic for cold nights! I would highly recommend a sketch of anyone, very stylish."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Don't buy this jacket,1,It is fit for a fat person. The inner lining is kind of scratchy. They charged me $6 to return it. There was no free drop off for this item either. So I had to spend another $10 for packaging. I feel completely ripped off. I ordered this for a present... it didn't fit and generally sucked... it cost me a total of $16 to return it. So I just pissed money away. Avoid the same mistake and avoid this product and this vendor!
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Great jean jacket,5,"This is a jacket I always wanted to have. Great quality denim, very thick, I love the fact it made in Mexico from US garment. I usually wear xl but having read reviews I decided to go for xxl. It fits quite right, I can put on a sweater or even hoodie underneath, and wear it on cold sunny day. It should last years to come. Happy with the purchase."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Wonderful jacket!!!,5,"I love this. Well made despite it being made in China which I have never favored but what is not made in China. I have been looking for a denim with Sherpa lined jacket for a couple of years and I cringed when I saw some in a western store near Youngstown, Ohio. They were cheaply made, so I was leery at first prior to ordering this, but very happy once I received it."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,GREAT JACKET !,5,"I really love this jacket. I have  loved this style since my teens. I wear a XL ,I'm 5ft9 218 with a weight lifter build. It fits nice ,I had to use the  side buttons to bring in the waist. I bought the same style from Levis. I had return it . It was way too small. I had to buy the XXL. It fits, but it's extremely stiff. The Wrangler feels like I been wearing it for years."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Decent Coat,4,"Overall I like the coat and would purchase it again. The two (2) issues I have are; the wrists are snug and the pockets are tiny! A 3""x5"" notepad will not fit in the front pockets without sticking out! Really? It's a LT and the pockets aren't even 5"" deep? Otherwise, it fits nice and keeps me warm. Not sure how layering will work with the snug wrists but I'll give it a shot with the buttons undone when it's cold enough."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,This is the denim jacket to get,5,"This is a great jacket. Per comments about the jacket running big, I ordered the L. I'm between L & XL on shirts/jackets, depending on cut. The L is  a little loose, but, feels really good. It's the perfect size for me. This Truckers jacket runs larger, including body length, than the heavy weight sherpa lined Wrangler deep blue denim jacket, and, the unlined denim jacket. I ordered those 2 jackets in XL, and, they are just on the line of fitting, however, the next larger size on them would've been too big, since I don't layer with heavy weight garments.  I ordered 3 different Wrangler denim jackets, 2 sherpa, 1 unlinked, and, all 3 are great. I am very happy with my purchases."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Jacket Fits Perfect!!,5,"I'm a big man, 6'1""  and 270 lbs, but built pretty solid, like a refrigerator, straight up and down lol....i don't buy many jackets online because of the fear that they will not fit, but  took a chance on this Wrangler Denim Jacket. I've always like the Western style.  Kept my fingers crossed as I opened the package and tried this XXL on, IT FIT PERFECT!!!!!! Great quality, pretty soft actually, does not need much breaking in! Great product!!"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Better than I expected!,5,"Saw some reviews that said the material was thin, or that the fleece material was coming off.  I am very satisfied with the quality.  The denim is nice and thick.  I ordered the large fearing that it might not fit.  I'm 6 ft and 215 lbs (after having lost 50 lbs in the last 6 months).  Fit me perfectly.  It will still fit as I continue to lose weight as it has buttons to cinch in the waist."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Perfect fit !,5,"As I'm always leery of ordering Imported clothes I was really surprised with the perfect fit ! Being 5'8"" and 130 pounds I can wear a Small or Medium. I decided to go with the small as I like a snug fit. This fits just the way I wanted ! The only negative with this jacket is the small Wrist size and difficulty snapping the wrist up. It would be perfect with a 2 position snap to accommodate different size wrists. All in all I'm very happy with the fit and quality !"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,"Great jacket, though it contains plastic",4,"Good jacket, warm in the winter and a great windbreak.  Though do be cautious that like a lot of clothing, this company chose to include plastic in the manufacturing. So plastic fibers will degrade in the sun, end up in the dust you breathe, and end up in the waterways if ever you wash the jacket."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,So disappointed...Fits way too big!,1,"Just received the Wrangler Western Rustic Sherpa jacket and am VERY disappointed.  I am a size large in everything I own.  So, I ordered a size large (42-44) in this jacket.  I immediately began laughing hysterically when I tried it on for the first time.  It was so big on me that it completely looked ridiculous. The size was so off, that I'm wondering if the Medium will even fit!!  As much as I like Wrangler and this jacket, I may have to pass on this jacket."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,"An ok Jacket, but prefer the quality of my old one",2,"Not a bad Jacket, but not the quality I’d expect from Wrangler. The sherpa fluff stuff feels and looks cheap, as does the liner in the arms. The buttons look different from the ones they use on the pants which seems odd. Sadly will return this and continue to use my old denim jacket (made by another brand that won’t be mentioned)."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Love this jacket,5,"This is a great jacket for the money - I was very hesitant to buy it because I don't have much luck buying clothes online- but after reading lots of the reviews I decided I'd give it a shot - so I am 6'3"" and weigh 225 - 44"" chest - 35"" waist - I ordered the large tall and it fits like it was custome made for me - not too short or long - not too tight in the chest - no issues with the buttons being too tight - its heavy and warm - looks great for country or urban wear - I love it"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,The Original,5,"My wife bought this jacket to replace my old jacket.  It was a perfect match, I got the XL and it fit me perfect at a cheat measurement of 46 inches.  It leaves just enough room for a sweatshirt, or sweater underneath.  I’m 5’8” and sized regular.  The jacket is so nice in a rich blue, like a new pair of 501’s. The fleece is a sufficient and very warm, perfect for cold winter days/nights.  Great product!"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Order size up,4,Great quality jacket but it was too small for my father especially in arm length and it came up above his belt line. I plan on ordering a large this time instead of a medium. I really thought with him being a really small skinny guy it would fit him but I guess not.  The material is very good though and I can tell would be good for winter.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,You Need One of These!,5,"One of my favorite jackets and nice and warm. Well made, sturdy and looks good. I am 135 lbs and 6’1” and the medium is loose on me but still looks good. Washed it in hot washer and then in hot drier and it didn’t shrink. Great jacket."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Replaced 25 year old Levi jacket.,4,"I shopped everywhere for a new winter work jacket for my husband when a new puppy destroyed what was left of his very old fleece lined jacket.  He loves it except for one thing, BUTTONS.  His old jacket had large heavy duty snaps that he could close with gloves on.  These buttons are very difficult to work on such thick material.  It's a beautiful jacket, I worry that the dark denim will fade on the fleece when I wash it.  We shall see."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,"Great Fit! No ""Orangutan"" sleeves.",5,"i hesitate to buy coats online as it's too hard to get an exact fit. This one fits perfectly. I ordered an XL and it's like it was made for me. I am 5'9"", 200 lbs., with a 47 chest and (honest) 38 waist. Usually XL's give you ""orangutan length"" sleeves. These are just right, extending barely an inch onto my hand if I unsnap the cuff. Haven't washed it yet, but there's enough room to make me believe it will be no problem."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Classic Jacket - Cowboy Style,4,"I am giving this FIVE stars  because I really like this jacket and the shipping was extremely fast . ---- I did have a couple of concerns though . The first -- I am a pretty big guy . 6 ft tall -- 240 pounds . I was not quite sure of what size to order cause just like everybody else - I hate returning something . Just a hassle !! --- So I followed the size chart and read all the reviews .( I wish that some other folks would of shared with us what their height and weight were in these reviews) . -- Anyway -- My chest is between a size 48 and 50 . -- I settled on the size XL in this jacket . After it arrived I tried it on and it looks great ( without buttoning up ) . When I do button up the jacket , it is very relaxed in the front . I have a nice size gut as well but you would never know wearing this jacket . Plenty of room for a hoodie or thermals or flannels . --- Now -- I don't know if I like that ?!?! I don't want to wear a hooded jacket underneath because I don't think that will look right . If it was a plain collar than yes . But the collar is sherpa-like and that I wouldn't want to obstruct the jackets collar . Does that make any sense ??? -- Another concern of mine was the quality of the denim . ---- I remember having this jacket when i was in my teens ( 3 decades ago ) - and for some reason that jacket seemed a heck of a lot thicker . This denim seems thin . --- OH-- I did wash and dry the day I received it ( I wanted to actually try and shrink it a little ). I don't think it shrunk at all . ( I couldn't tell because the front still seemed big  in the gut area ) . ---- I still like the jacket overall .  The price is good as well . If the denim was thicker no doubt this jacket would be selling for $100 some odd dollars , right ?---"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,I love this coat!!,5,It is a roomy coat--allows space for a sweater underneath. Its great coat for doing outdoor chores as well as wearing it for form. This has quickly become my go-to coat. It is well built and the denim feels thick-it doesn't have that cheap/thin denim feeling. They were so popular in the 80s--I'm glad to see that they are coming back.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Must have,5,"Love love love. I had this on this winter in about 16 degree weather and I was sweating but it is so comfortable. Will buy again when I need another one. I will buy the ""dirty"" Sherpa next time though."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,fat guy in a little coat.,3,Im am almost positive I got sent a Small with a Medium labellike my sleeves short me by 3 inches if I keep my shoulders straight and raise my arms. and it barely goes to my hips.Im 6 foot 155. Im not a big guy. for you. Ive never had a medium jacket not fit me. this is like asia sizing.honestly I just got it today and Im gonna return it. Ive never returned clothes before. I mean if I can return it? I took the tags off already. I still love the jacket I just want a large.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Nice jacket,5,My husband looks hot in this and it’s super warm. He let me wear it the other day when it was windy and the wind did not come through. It kept me super warm. I’m glad he bought this and I’d recommend it to friends.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,American sizes should be made obvious,4,"The quality of this jacket is great and the delivery quick. However, it was listed as ""medium"" and the associated size given in inches matches a medium size but when delivered it was much larger than expected. I have seen this before and it is obvious that American sizes do not match the rest of the world when it comes to sizes. Fortunately, this jacket will be worn over jumpers so it can work but still a little disappointed."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Awesome jacket at a better price than Levi's!,5,"This jacket is exactly what I was looking for. I searched for the levi's sherpa-lined trucker jacket for some time without any success. I decided to try this guy out as an alternate choice and I'm glad I did. The sherpa lining feels like it'll last for years. The denim is a nice rich color that I anticipate will fade nicely over the years. I'm really happy with my purchase and the quality of my new favorite jacket. I've worn it basically everyday through a colder-than-usual Portland winter and it's done well to keep me warm. It's well constructed too, which is a plus considering it's got a timeless style that I think will hold up well over the next decade. It's definitely worth a look. I wear mine with a similar washed jean for that ""Canadian tuxedo"" look. Overall it's a great jacket that provides an urban take on a 70's staple."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,This jacket is awesome,5,"It's a cool looking jacket that keeps me nice and warm. I love the sherpa lining and buttoning it up instead of zippers (my beard especially loves this). My only qualm is the nylon on the inside of the pockets that doesn't quite keep my hands as warm as it could if they had put a little sherpa lining on the front part of the pocket. To remedy this i just put a fleece glove in each pocket to provide a warmer barrier between my hands and the front part of the pocket. But, the jacket feels well made and I look forward to having it for many years!"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,LT is XXL,1,"The coat is not a large tall, which means the size of the chest and waist are simply a size large but the arms and waist are longer, hence the name ""large tall.""  This is just huge, it fits like an xxl sweatshirt. If I needed an xxl and not a lt, it would be a nice enough coat. As it is, I cannot wear it and I cannot return it."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Great jacket in tall sizes,5,"I have purchased two of these jackets for two of my sons.  One is 6’6”, and one is 6’7”.  They both love this jacket.  It is available in tall sizes, and they both need an XL Tall.  It fits them perfectly, and the lining is not too thin and not too bulky.  Shirts and hoodies can be comfortably worn underneath.  It is perfect for someone who needs a casual, durable, comfortable jacket rather than a heavyweight coat."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Really Well Made,4,"Really nice and well made jacket, especially when you see what else is out there.. This particular model was very much to short... I realize its a jacket and is supposed to be shorter, but I happened to need a tall... There doesn't seem to be very many tall's out there... I see it comes in a tall, but they seem to be sold out.. Great looking and seemed to be really warm as well.."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Worth the money!,5,"Love this jacket!!! Denim isn’t as heavy as it was back in...well a while ago but, still a quality product. I run a 46 regular and the XL I purchased fits great with enough room for a heavy sweatshirt or vest underneath."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Happy with it,4,"People have been having some hit and miss experiences with this, which is typical for clothing bought online. For reference, I ordered the darker blue.  My medium fit me very well, and the quality of the jacket is top notch. The collar is a little funky, but not important. Warm and comfortable."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Fine jacket,5,"Love the jacket. I'm a tall and wide kinda guy and this jacket fits fine. Material and workmanship is great. It's a little better insulated than I was expecting which should widen the temperature range where I can use it. It looks great. I bought it to be a ""work"" jacket, but now I'll wear it as a real jacket until I mucky it up somehow and can then use it as a work jacket. The brown corduroy collar goes very well with a leather Australian ""Crocodile Dundee"" style hat I own. Well satisfied. [Don't get me wrong. You probably won't be wearing this to any formal black tie event, but for every day, around town use it's swell.]"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Great,4,I got my husband this coat and he likes it.  I think he doesn’t love how white the fluff is but I’m sure it’ll get dingy over time.  He said it’s very warm.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Awesome,5,"This is the first of this type jacket I have bought, and absolutely love it. Perfect fit, I ordered a large."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Great for cool to cold weather wear,5,I wear this jacket for every day wear until it gets extremely cold. It great for layering and it just feels good. Western wear at its finest
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Very warm and comfortable,5,"The jacket is as I expected and I rate it high. The only issue I have is with the small button holes for the metal buttons. They are slightly smaller and tough to get the button through until they stretch out. Simple cut of 1/8 inch more of the hole and it works fine.Material is very good and is very warm, you won't want to wear it in a warm room for too long, but out in cold temps it is perfect."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Cowboy style,5,"This jacket is well sized. My son is tall and slim, but likes things that fit loosely. He is 6’2” and 146 lbs- the medium is perfect for him. He could wear a light sweatshirt underneath if he needed."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Wanna look just like Walker Texas Ranger?,5,"I chose the Levi’s jacket for my beau but he wanted to look just like Cordell Walker so we HAD to get the Wrangler one. As soon as he put it on, he was roundhouse kicking bad guys! This purchase was definitely a winner!"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,A nice jacket that didn't fit.,3,"A nice jacket but it did not fit me, a 5'2"" 130 lb athletic, busty  woman. I liked the lining, and the color, and the quality. The women's version of these jackets are made for runway models not for my type of build. I was hoping that this would work, but it did not. I can wear many men's smalls, as they fit my chest and shoulders well."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Amazing quality for the price. Follow the fit guide,5,"Really impressed with the quality of this jacket. It is very warm. Highly recommended.For reference, I'm 5'8, 175lbs. 42"" chest, 31"" waist. Medium was perfect with a little room in the torso to add a layer. Arm length was perfect, and width at the shoulders was spot on."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Wrangler Sherpa Lined Denim Jacket 2X,5,"Just received this jacket in the mail and on a Sunday too. Debated for a couple months as to which manufacturer to purchase from. I'm not sorry for my choice. Being 6' 5"" and 250 lbs., I was concerned with the fit. However once I put it on those concerns were forgotten. Just like a new pair of jeans the material is stiff but I know once this jacket is broken in it'll be very comfortable. Sleeve length is perfect, stopping right at my wrists. The bottom of the jacket just covers my belt. Had a Levi's jacket like this back in the early eighties. This one is a fair replacement at half the cost. Couldn't be happier."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Best of Sherpa Lined Mens Jackets,5,"We shopped Wranglers, and Levis and a few others.  This was the only brand where the fit was like the unlined and the lining performed.  Also, collar is fuller adding to look of quality.  For temps that are cold but not much below freezing, its a great jacket - good looking and warm while casual."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Love it,5,"Purchased for my husband alittle heavier than expected, however we live in Florida and temps were in 30's and it was perfect the added insulation just right."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Snug As A Bug....,5,We just returned from a 4 day camping trip in Central Oregon. Because this was a bit too early in the Spring it tended to be a bit chilly. My Wrangler Sherpa Jean Jacket did the job. It kept me warm and very cozy throughout the 4 day period. I'll never give this one up. Thanks Wrangler & Amazon.com.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Iconic Denim Jacket,5,"I normally don't wear alot jackets when driving, but this one perfect!! But gotta rock w/ ""Bandito"" hat cowbow or ""High Plaines drifter hat!! And slim jim or dog chew in mouth for effect.."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,LOVE,5,"Perfect jacket.  Love everything about it BUT...the buttons are hard to button.  This is due to the stiffness of the jean material, I think, and will get easier over time.  But the jean jacket look and the warmth are top notch.  BEST rating!"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,High quality,5,I bought it for my son for his birthday. Perfect fit and he wears it all the time
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,heavy duty and very warm jacket,5,"Just received a jacket. The jacket It is made of quality denim , very warm perfect for spring season ,feels really good. It's the perfect size for me. This jacket is exactly what I was looking for, I really love it."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,the best,5,"what you'd expect, high quality materials and construction."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Real thing,5,"I was concerned that I might end up with a knock off. But no, this is a real Wrangler. I had a 2XL in this same jacket, but have lost weight so needed to go down a size. Fits great, is comfortable and warm."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Would buy again,4,"Bought this for my son for Christmas. He really liked it! I bought a large, (which is the size he normally wears in coats and jackets) and it fit him perfect. It sits right at his waist, which he liked. He says it's very warm, and he loves the color and the feel of the lining."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Jacket,5,High quality jacket you would expect. I tried on a few at a local western store to find my size before ordering off of Amazon. For was perfect. This jacket is also super warm and withstands the wind. Looks great
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,he looks great in it (a lot like the flashback scenes of ...,5,"Husband is 5'10"" 180 lb - got the Large for Christmas '16 and fits him perfectly.  Shipping was quick.  He loves it.  Even though I feel it's not as substantial as the ones I remember from the 1970's, he looks great in it (a lot like the flashback scenes of Jack Pearson's character on This is Us  -hubba hubba) and our weather in Louisville is mild enough to wear this most of the fall and winter.  Very pleased.  Now planning to get one for our teenaged son."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Xtra large is more like an XX,4,"I'm 6'4 and 250 lbs. I usually take an extra large everything, so I ordered this jacket X-large. It was WAY to big. I returned it for a large, and am very happy with the fit. It's still a little big, but in a good way. The tall size fits my arms and hits my waist just right. I wish the denim was a little heavier, but all in all I am happy."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,"Fits well, denim pretty light weight.",3,"Bought this for my wife.  Fit and finish were fine, and as far as description the product was as delivered.  However it seems that the weight of denim has changed over the years since we last bought a jacket.  The denim is very light, not at all like jean jackets from even 5 years ago.  I guess for some this is fine, and maybe even more comfortable, but we thought it was a little cheap and flimsy."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Great jacket!,5,This is the second jacket I bought for my boyfriend. He’s rough on clothes and absolutely ruined the first one! So he got a new one for his birthday this year. He absolutely loves it. I just ordered another for my dad for Christmas. We love wrangler!
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,"Best light weight jacket ever,LOVE it.",5,"I love this jackets lining, it is right in the middle of my other jacket and sheepskin lining and one without any lining, It also doubles as a throw over for my dog when she is sleeping. Perfect jacket."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Nice jacket,5,Still summer but winter is around the corner. Can’t wait to wear it on horseback this winter. Just wish these Iconic western wear companies still made their products in America. Wrangler should be ashamed.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Love this jacket,5,"Love this jacket.  You might want to buy 1 size smaller.  I'm usually a Large but this medium fit me perfect.  I'm 5'10"" and 175lbs.  Good luck buttoning the thing though, the buttons are a pita.  But who wants to look like this guy in the picture does?  Wear it open like a real cowboy."

Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,"Versatile Jacket, Comfortable....",5,"Better than Levi one in my humble opinion.Like inside pocket a lot.Feels so right, like a denim hug."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Great Product,5,"Jacket fits very well by itself. If adding a light hoodie it will still fit perfectly. Used this jacket as casual and at work (cattle work/auction stuff) and messing with cows and getting dirty, it has held up very well. In all, great purchase and very durable under the conditions i’ve put it through this far!"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Must buy,5,I love this jacket! The quality is top teir and it feels right when you put it on. I have a rough time hanging it up for the summer months.

Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Cowboy Cut Love,5,"I absolutely love this jacket. The Wrangler quality is in every stitch. This ain’t no big box store Wrangler either.

Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Nice,5,Looks very good
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Fits women great too!,5,"Bought this jacket because the women’s was on backorder. It fits great, except the cuffs only have one snap adjustment and it’s almost too tight to wear a pair of gloves under the jacket. Other than that, it’s great!"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Great for style and work.,5,Wrangler Diffently has my vote for this authentic Jean Jacket.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,I would advise you to order a size bigger then ...,5,"I would advise you to order a size bigger then you normally wear, l owned one already and new to do that."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Great Jacket,5,This item was just as described.  A great fall or spring jacket!
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,"Great jacket, but dreadful shipping experience",4,"The jacket is great, but Amazon really let us down this time.  First, the jacket: it fit well (xl for someone who normally wears that size) and is much closer in weight and styling to the very old favorite one being replaced than we expected.  Like the old one, it has sizing buttons on the waist, one good open interior chest pocket, and good side pockets.  The outer chest pockets are much smaller in both width and height (just barely wide enough for a smart phone but not tall enough to close over one) and have sturdy snaps instead of buttons - we'll see how these hold up.  The sleeves have one snap instead of a button.  I would give 5 stars if the chest pockets weren't so small.Now for Amazon:  we ordered this jacket prime for a particular need and it took SIX calendar days to get here.  What?  Normally our items (and we order a lot) come UPS and arrive like clockwork.  Happy customer.  This one came FedEx and the tracking notes are very interesting, starting with ""Processed by shipper and loaded in trailer said to contain package"".  Then the regular status continues showing it took 6 days, including going from California to Portland and then back to us in Southern Oregon.  We don't know if the fault was Amazon's or FedEx's, but either way, what is the remedy for this failure of service for our prime membership?  Either way, Amazon, please go back to using UPS!!"

Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Runs a little large. Or maybe spot on you decide.,5,Im in that in-between size between 42-44 (L) and 46-48 (XL) so the XL is just a might loose but not bad. If you go and shrink it with a hot wash and hot dry the fit was then perfect. :-)

Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,The best deal I've found for these,5,"Although I absolutely love this jacket and gave it 5 stars because I've searched for tjhis jacket for a long time (it is the most simular to those of the 70's I had  and loved and wanted again badly) I was so psyched when I found it on from wrangler  and bought it.  Pros- very well made. Has the bright white sherpa lining over chest section  which most others only have that cheap looking dull white or yellow lining the arms are lined with another lining all combined for a warn jacket that looks great.  It has a great price!! where as most brands sell their lightweight jackets for the same price (or higher?!)  The outside pockets are roomy enough Con's- runs small by at least a size and doesn't provide inside pockets like their lighter weight denim jackets do, also because it is not rewashed when you wash it for the first time it will Run and that means the bright white sherpa will become duller"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Great fit,5,This jacket fits just the way i wanted
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Super fun,3,"This jacket us super fun, but we had to exchange it for a larger size. Normally wear a medium, but this medium was too tight around the back and shoulders."

Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Great lookin cowboy jacket,5,"Great fit, a little shorter than a more modern version (see, Levi's Trucker Sherpa jacket) but it still looks really good. Bought it as a gift, he wears it every day. A size L fits 6'2"" man, who's probably about 200-220 lbs. Again, if he raises his arms it comes up above his belt buckle, but it still works."

Picked this particular jacket because the lining, while ""plaid"", the coloring is subtle dark red-ish color, and the style is not ""too country"".

Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,I like the coat it is very warm,4,I like the coat it is very warm. Buttons are hard at first but you will get use to it. I ordered a size bigger and I should have ordered 2 times the size so I can wear a sweater under it.

Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,"Good quality, very warm jacket.",5,"My husband loves this jacket. It's been very cold here, below freezing for weeks now and he says it's very warm.  Loves the style and quality."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Wrangler Sherpa Denim Jacket,4,"Significantly more lining than expected in both sleeves and torso, so fit is a bit tight (fittings for me are typically too large). Heavy duty denim cloth, heavy duty construction...much better than expected for domestic brand."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Warm and comfortable,5,Very warm and it will take some really cold days in Texas to be able to wear it. The wrist snap for one sleeve was crimped when it arrived but I was able to straighten it without replacing the snap.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Great Fit,5,My husband loves this jacket! Great fit and appears to be well made.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Not made like it used to be...,3,"First off, it does seem to fit a bit on the large side. What I don't like is that it compares poorly with my 12 year old ""identical"" jacket. The material just doesn't feel as heavy duty. It just doesn't have the ""body"" my older jacket has. The older jacket still, after innumerable washings, will still stand up in a corner. Since I plan to use it as an around-town jacket rather than a around-the-house work jacket I suppose it doesn't matter. I just prefer the old one and feel it was of a higher quality. By the way, I still have my old jacket to compare to."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Jacket,5,"Fits great, real warm, great quality... bought it to dress up as Tommy Jarvis for Halloween but plan on wearing it regularly bc it’s an awesome coat."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,"It's a great jacket, built for wearing on those cool and ...",4,"Does run a little larger per the other reviews but I'm okay with this. It allows me to layer underneath for the colder weather. It's a great jacket, built for wearing on those cool and cold nights. I love it."

Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,What can you say...it's a Wrangler.,5,What can you say...it's a Wrangler.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,This was perfect. There's plenty of room for an extra layer ...,5,"I purchased this jacket in medium. I find that medium sizes tend to either be a bit large or too snug (I'm 6'1"" and about 160 lbs). This was perfect. There's plenty of room for an extra layer or three. It's comfortable and warm."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Great jacket,5,"This ""Canadian tuxedo"" is just what we were looking for..."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Can't beat Wrangler,5,Upgraded my old Wrangler jacket with this one. The new one is awesome but I still won't part with the old one. This one is much warmer because its lined. Can't beat Wrangler in my opinion.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Happy with the coat,4,"Happy with the coat. It is just a bit big but would not go smaller. I had one of these years ago and even pasted it down to my son, this one does not feel as thick as the old one was but will see how it holds up. I would buy another one though for the price."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Order a size up,5,"Got this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. He is 6'1"" and 170 so i ordered the large and it fits perfect. So i would order a size up from what they normally wear because the inside is so thick. But he loved it :)"

Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Nice Jacke,5,Great Jacket....just make sure you order it based on shirt size.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Great buy!,5,This jacket met every expectation and fit true to size.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Very nice in every way,5,The jacket was a gift for a grandson. he is medium tall and slender. The jacket was a little large around. I would like to say the jacket is very attractive and well made. I would not hesitate to recommend it. Excellent jacket for the price
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,"Warm, Western-Style Denim Jacket",4,"This is a great-looking jacket, with enough Sherpa lining to keep the wearer warm in the coldest weather. The white lining is a bright and clean white, which looks especially nice around the collar. I ordered a large, and it fits well, but there's not enough room for an additional sweater layer. Fortunately, the lining makes this additional layer unnecessary. The sleeves close with metal snaps, which makes the jacket easy to take on and off; the remaining buttons--including the cinches on either side of the waist--are metal buttons, which can be difficult to get in and out of the button holes. When the denim relaxes a bit, this problem may go away. Overall, I like this unique jacket a lot."
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,poor quality,1,Cheapest jeans at Walmart have better quality (both material and made) than this Wrangler jacket.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Wrangler Sherpa jean jacket scoop!,4,"I got this for my father who has 2 of these type of jackets in older versions. He needed this jacket in a LONGER length to cover his backside in the cold because these sherpa jean jackets are always so short, usually to the waist, which he has now, but he froze a bit in the bitter cold! This jacket has some length. He would have liked the sherpa lining to be a bit thicker but it is ok. This product seems to run bigger, which is fine because you need room in the arms to wear sweaters underneath the jacket, but I had no real idea how to gauge the size properly and returned it twice until I got him the right fit. His old ones were XL but he took a MEDIUM in this version. It has fashionable brown courdoroy trims behind the collar and on the inner cuffs ( so you can flip up the cuffs) and the cuffs have snaps, which is good. The bottom of the jacket has adjustable tab buttons on each side to make the hem have a tighter fit if you want..The jacket has metal jean buttons -- I hope the binding on the buttonholes holds up. The jean finish is softer and jacket has alot of great stitching detail. The color is a good darker to mid- blue. Maybe I will get one myself!"
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Five Stars,5,Love this jacket. Fits perfectly and is very warm.
Wrangler Men's Western Style Lined Denim Jacket,Excellent jacket for winter.,5,Perfect. I like this jacket more than I thought I would. it is warm and stylish.

ARIAT Men's Vernon 2.0 Softshell Jacket,Shipping issues,3,"I have zero problems with the quality and fit of the jacket. However the seller rolled it up tightly so that it could be shipped in a relatively small shipping envelope. As a result of that the jacket had severe wrinkles in it that washing and steaming hasn’t gotten out, the jacket label says not to iron or dry clean. Shipping in a flat rate box would have avoided the problem with wrinkles."
ARIAT Men's Vernon 2.0 Softshell Jacket,Really nice fit,5,"Im 6ft 195, and the large fits really nice.  Not too big or small, perfect fit, arms move well too.  I really like the jacket."
ARIAT Men's Vernon 2.0 Softshell Jacket,Great fit,5,Bought this for my son and he loves it. It looks very expensive but was extremely affordable. Highly recommend this jacket. Beautiful fit too.
ARIAT Men's Vernon 2.0 Softshell Jacket,Quality product.,4,"Good quality jacket overall, fits a little large for me, but it's due to my own frame. I am 5'6"", 190lbs...tried a medium, and it was tight. Not wearable at that size. The large fits a little bit on the arms, and shoulders. Everything else is good. Cool jacket."
ARIAT Men's Vernon 2.0 Softshell Jacket,High Quality Jacket !!,5,This jacket is great in cold weather and a quality product.

ARIAT Men's Vernon 2.0 Softshell Jacket,The Real Deal,5,"Its Legit And Fits True To Size, Feels Good And Durable !"
ARIAT Men's Vernon 2.0 Softshell Jacket,Excellent Jacket,5,"First of all, I haven't bought this Jacket yet, but I will.  I tried it on in a Cabela's store and it fit me like a glove.  It looks very elegant, yet tough.  I came across this jacket as my mindset has been on getting a tactical jacket.  After purchasing several made-in-China tactical jackets on Amazon that didn't fit me correctly that I had to return (large was too small and XL was too big on 3 separate purchases),  I stumbled across this jacket as I was walking through the mens department in a Cabela's in Omaha.  I decided to try it on.  As I already mentioned above it fit me perfectly and I could tell it is a very warm jacket. Of course, Cabela's price was upwards of $100...so I will buy it on Amazon."
ARIAT Men's Vernon 2.0 Softshell Jacket,You find good things in odd places I guess..,5,"This is the first jacket my husband has owned in years. He always just wore hoodies, but walking through a casino gift shop, this jacket was hanging there. He liked the style, and decided to try it on, and it fit great! I did end up buying the exact same one on Amazon and saved a couple bucks, but it’s a really nice jacket for the cost. I’d recommend to others"
ARIAT Men's Vernon 2.0 Softshell Jacket,"Worth the cost, maybe",5,"This is the best jacket I've ever owned. Perfect for mild Texas winters. Mine was unfortunately stolen out of my truck. It was a gift, and I'm not sure I can justify paying $100 to replace it, but I'm definitely thinking about it. And I'm a cheap ass, so that should tell you a lot about the quality of this jacket."
ARIAT Men's Vernon 2.0 Softshell Jacket,Great product,5,This was a present for my husband’s birthday and he loved it it fits as expected!
ARIAT Men's Vernon 2.0 Softshell Jacket,,0,"Es una chaqueta bastante bonita, de un material de calidad y genera una gran vista como accesorio vaquero, me quedó perfecta puede usarse en ambientes fríos por su material térmico aunque por debajo de los -3 pierdes protección"

The North Face Men's Grays Torreys Insulated Jacket,,0,"Super light, thin, soft, perfect for cool evenings in summer."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",AMAZING JACKET,5,Looks exactly like the photo fits perfect excellent quality excellent zipper quality very happy with this purchase
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",Good for the price,5,Jacket fit perfectly I’m 5’6 160 pounds and I got a small and it fits like I expected.
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",Awesome for men and women!,5,I bought this because women’s jackets are overpriced and usually have sleeves that don’t reach my wrists. Freaking loooove this jacket. It’s simple and light. It’s very well made and would recommend to any gender!
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",Cheap windbreaker,2,"First, it's just a windbreaker, not a jacket.  No insulation.  Fit and color are okay.  The zippers are cheap metal.  The main zipper is backwards for a man's jacket, better for a left-handed person.  The zippered pocket on the sleeve has the stitching coming loose after just three wearings, I'll have to mend it soon.  Next time I'll shop more carefully."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",Wrong Gender Sent,3,"I ordered the Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Jacket, but received a Women's Jacket-Lightweight Jacket. The jacket itself fit perfectly, with the exception of the zipping on the wrong side for me. In fact, I like the jacket so much that I will order another ""Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Flight Bomber Jacket"".  However, if I receive another women's jacket I will return the item."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",CHEAP QUALITY. DONT WASTE MONEY,1,The product has a very cheap quality. The zippers are very cheap and the material used is extremely low quality
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",SOOO small!,4,"Let me start out by saying I had to order 3 of these, each one a different size up in order to find one that wasn't made for a 9 year old.These run super small. My shirt size is a USA medium/large, I'm 5 foot 11 muscular build, and the large was terribly small.I might have fit into it when I was 14, maybe.If you're going to order this, think 2 to 3 sizes bigger. The one that I eventually ended up getting that didn't constrict my body into unconciousness ended up being  XL, and it still fits a bit slim.Otherwise, it's a nice little super ultra light jacket. Kinda feels like wearing a garbage bag with some thin cloth around it, which was great during summer."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",Shiny Zippers ruin the jacket,1,"Everything is fine about the jacket but the zippers are obnoxiously shiny and bright compared to the muted base color.  Looking at it all a person would think is SHINY ZIPPERS.  Pretty dorky looking for a bomber, which is supposed to be low profile and minimalistic.  The zippers are shinier than the pictures represent."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",A really slick and good looking jacket with an athletic fit.,5,"I picked this jacket up due to the generally positive reviews, and because my wife and I both thought it looked sharp.  I am 6'2"", 190 lbs.  I have a fairly athletic build. 32"" waist and 44"" jacket, and I purchased the large.  It fits me like I had it made to measure.  Plenty of sleeve length, a good fit around the wrists and neck, and surprisingly, a taper to the waist that is not often found in inexpensive clothes.  It produces a leaner profile.  The zippers are of excellent quality with substantial all-steel pulls.  The left bicep pocket is actually useful at times, but I mostly keep candy in it. It would probably work well for an ipod.  This is a good light jacket for athletic use or in moderate weather.  I have had this jacket a little while and it does a pretty good job of stopping rain and wind from spoiling your fun, and is also stylish enough to wear casually."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M","Does not keep you warm but its light, stylish, high-quality and windbreaker-ish",4,"I bought this for my boyfriend.What i do like is the material its a wind breaker but its so smooth like, high quality material. The jacket is light but heavier than a windbreaker but i doubt you can feel the difference when you put it on. The zipper is so smooth too when you zip up and down. Doesn't make that nasty cheap zippers noise or stops you every inch. But I dont like how there's no patting or that criss cross patting to keep you warm like at least a little. I thought I bought a ""bomber jacket"" not a bomber jacket like that's a wind breaker. I will be keeping it though. Luckily I bought a bigger size on accident. I'll just have my boyfriend wear it over a hooded sweater."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",Comfy well-make jacket,5,"Generally, I quite like this jacket and I think I got good value for my money. If I could make one small change, I wish there was a Velcro or snap closure on the inner pocket. I use it for my cell phone, but the lack of a closure means there is nothing to keep the cell from falling out if I, say, take my jacket off and set it somewhere. There is a zipper pocket on the left sleeve, but I prefer to keep my cell on the inside pocket. Even so, I'm not sorry I bought it; nice jacket for the price."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",It’s a great jacket!,5,"This jacket is great! You might want to order a size bigger though, unless you are super fit with six pack abs and not really broad shoulders. I usually wear an XL but I had to order the 2X. I’m 5’8” and weigh 220, so I’m a pretty big solid dude. Anyways, the color of this jacket in that green is awesome. Goes with my camouflage pants, some people even say it brings out the color in my eyes. I wore it out to dinner and received a few compliments and someone even asked me where I bought this sweet jacket at. You should have seen the look on their face when I told them I bought it off Amazon! Great Jacket, Great Quality, Great Color and Great Price!"
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",Ran small,4,"I usually wear an XL in my shorts, and jackets, in order for them to be a little loose and comfortable.  This jacket was way too tight in the body, and too short in the torso.  I was surprised that the arms were an okay length, as that is typically where coats and jackets fail me.  I do think I could have gotten used to the zipper pull being on the other side of normal (zipper on the left, versus the right)... but I've no choice but to return this, and consider the next size up."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",My grandson has it,5,Very nice jacket. Appears well made. Sticking is great and without a flaw. Material is lightweight and very comfortable. So much so that my grandson decided he would wear it. So it was the week after his birthday so I gave him another birthday gift. I thought it really said something about the jacket the he tried it on and fit so well he didn't want to take it of.  It fit both of us well and for me as expected. I now am in the market again for me another jacket and considering the same jacket but probably a different color. Don't want to crowd his style.
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",Very disappointed with the color - color (Royal Blue) is two shades lighter than image on Amazon,2,"Royal Blue - TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual - Fabric feels good (large size - I'm 6:2, medium build), but Royal Blue color is lighter color and sheen duller than advertised - I was hoping for the color in Amazon roll-over. Metal zipper is a bit harder to zip/unzip but still seems good quality. If you are buying dependent on color, think twice. Same was true from the Khaki #02 color was lighter and duller than representation on Amazon."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",Solid jacket,5,"Fit as i expected, i have a shorter torso so maybe it was just me or my preference but the length was maybe 2-3 inches longer than id like but the length in the arms was perfect. The quality of the jacket is easily worth the price. Nice color as well."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M","Great looking, well-constructed, fall/spring jacket",5,"My son chose this jacket and has worn it every day since. It looks more mature than pulling on a hoodie and he hates the ""puffy"" look so this worked well for him. Warm enough for cool fall/spring days, simple lines, small details like the zipper on the sleeve all make it a good choice.  Well constructed jacket and the price was an added bonus."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M","Nice Jacket, but Runs Small",5,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He had been wanting it for a while and was on his wishlist.  However, when it arrived, I knew that it would be too small.  Overall he loved it and it was exactly what he wanted.  It just didn't fit.  It does run small."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",Fitz just right,4,"Liked this jacket it fits just right. It was just what I was looking for.Only one but on the jacket, the zippers are on the left side, I don't know what is happening with today's manufacturers but they're making all these zippers  on the left side. Other than that I like the jacket. I have received nothing but compliments on the jacket."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M","Bought a size up, and the arms are too tight",2,"I purchased this jacket for my boyfriend'a starlord cosplay. The reviews from others suggested buying a size up, so I did. Quality of material is great and the color is perfect, but it is almost like they sewed the wrong arms on the jacket. The width of the arms was so tiny and tight for an XL. I wear a small and it just barely fits the width of my arms. I will have to return this one, and have ordered a size up so hopefully the arms are better on that one. But this cosplay needs to be done by the weekend so I was forced to pay for overnight shipping this time around... :("
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",Fits great and very light,4,"Perfect lightweight spring jacket. It’s ad described and fits great reason for 4 stars is that there are a few loose strings on the inside of the jacket. I don’t expect it to last more than maybe this spring and early fall but it was pretty cheap so I didn’t expect much more. All in all, great fit but not the best quality."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",Tacvasen makes GOOD stuff,5,"Hammacher-Schlemmer sold me a WWII bomber jacket made by Tacvacsen, total $119. Bought exaxt jacket for my wife here for $45. H-S told me it's not the same. I e-mailed ""Colin"" the PROOF. He didn't answer. GREAT jackets. Wanted one for my wife, FORGOT I'd already bought her a NB. I'm very high on this producer."
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",Looks more expensive than it is,5,"I get daily compliments about this jacket; despite it costing less than 10% of my leather jacket, this gets way more compliments. I love it! It’s not really meant for the rain even though it looks like it is — I still wear it and risk getting soaked :)"
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",I like,5,Light jacket is very well made.  I was especially impressed with the silk like liner that lines the whole jacket.  I’m really glad I bought this jacket and the fit is perfect!
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",This isn't a men's jacket. False advertising.,1,This is a women's jacket that they are selling as a men's. The zipper is on the wrong side and its tailored to fit women. It's also very thing and feels like it's made of a cheap tent. Do not buy.
"TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Thin Sportwear Varsity Jacket, Green M",Two sizes too small,3,"I normally wear Large in shirts and jackets. I wanted a light weight jacket to wear over a fleece jacket, so I ordered X-Large in khaki. This one seems more like a Medium, too tight for me.Others have complained about wrinkles, and it's easy to see why. Mine came stuffed into an 11"" x 12"" Zip-Loc type bag. Those wrinkles might have smoothed out after washing, but who knows?The quality of construction, stitching, zippers, etc seems fine. Amazon made the return virtually effortless."

"DISHANG Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Softshell Flight Bomber Jacket Coat for Spring (Dark Grey, S)",Zipper Pull on Left Side,3,I purchased a men's jacket.  The zipper pull is on the left side while the zipper pulls for almost all mens' clothing are on the right.
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Just another cheap and poorly made jacket,3,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   Okay it’s not a winter jacket. No wind breaking as advertised. It’s barely good for 50 degree weather and a t shirt. The fit is that sort of odd not meant for anyone except ultra narrow people. You know the fit—you tried ordering unbranded clothes from amazon. Same crap. Sort of tight in the chest and worse when you move your arms forward. The length is kind of long and just feels off. The zipper is on the left so you know it’s just some factory excess. Friggin buttons look stupid as crap. One button doesn’t even button down. Cool feature! Zipper on chest goes to nowhere unless you want to put a small toothpick inside. If you’re reading this and hotly debating a $39.99 jacket just do yourself a solid and buy something from a real name or go to a store. Or screw it, but this garbage and enjoy your cheap jacket I don’t care. I used the shipping bag to pickup cat vomit so I guess I’m sticking with this thing. Maybe some kid at goodwill who tall and starved with abnormally short arms will enjoy this jacket for a season then die of exposure to the elements."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Not exactly as described,3,"Fits well, seems to be of decent quality and is comfortable. My only negative comment would be it's not exactly as described/ shown in pictures. The buttons are supposed to be black, they came in a stainless/chrome sort of finish. Had I known this would be the case I wouldn't have ordered."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Great with a caveat,4,"Overall, the jacket is well-made and a great value for the money. Some notes: The zippers over the breast pockets do not lead to actual pockets. They are decorative. They'd be useful for carrying around some toothpicks, perhaps. Also, the metal zipper sometimes puts up a bit of resistance. I wish they'd used nylon zippers throughout. The zipper zips on the opposite side Americana are used to. IOW, the traveling part of the zipper is on the left side (as you're wearing the jacket).The handwarmer pockets are rather small. Most men won't be able to get their whole hand in up to the wrist. If you're one of those guys with cather's mitt hands, fugetaboutit."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Very good quality for the price. Not a bad fit.,5,I'm 165lbs and 5'10 and ordered size US Large. It fits pretty good with just a tad bit extra room that I expect will shrink slightly in the wash. The material doesn't fee cheap and it looks like a jacket one could buy at the mall for much more money. I've gotten a few comments on it from friends about how they like the style. Will upload a photo for visual reference when I get some free time. Good buy overall.
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,NOT a warm jacket,3,"The jacket appears to be as advertised. I am 6'1"", 185 lbs, and am sure glad I ordered an XL, although I don't normally wear XL. The sleeves fit my long arms which I am grateful for.When I purchased,  the ad stated this was a ""Winter"" jacket. They changed the ad description now and it says ""windbreaker"" which it is. It has only 1 fabric layer and no insulation. It is suited for a summer night and that is about all.Also, the zipper is reversed so it is slightly confusing. But it fits, so I will keep it."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,"Crysully... ""You done good""!",5,"I had been looking into getting a Crysully jacket since last fall. I bocked at the opportunity because it just wasn't the right time but I landed (what I consider) the ideal jacket for my personal taste. Comfort, fit and durability were all in this jacket the moment I received it. Crysully has put together a solid product in this jacket. No frayed seam lines, no shoddy assembly I could see. As a customer, if you know your measurements and choose according to your comfort, the size chart gives you an accurate result that will leave you satisfied in the end. Keep in mind this is a Spring/Fall jacket so don't expect to gain total warmth in winter conditions. The stretchy cuffs and bottom of the jacket help to lock in heat, essential for preventing unwanted drafts from drawing heat from your core! And pockets... If you want a jacket where every zipper or buttoned flap leads to an actual functioning pocket and not just some fake pocket - look toward Crysully! As for color, I ordered the dark grey and was happier that it is darker than advertised on Amazon. The inner liner of the jacket is a nice nylon material (I think) that helps when putting the jacket on/off... prevents sleeve bunch-up and such. In time I may order another Crysully jacket but the one with the hood."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Slim Cut (Not for Pauncho!),3,"This appears to be a quality jacket. It’s much heavier than a wind breaker, more like a denim jacket. It’s fabric & zippers/snaps certainly feel substantial though I’m not sure if they, or the threading, would hold up over time. I’m returning it because though I ordered an extra large, which in American measurements would have been more than adequate, it’s a very narrow cut. Before ordering I did check all the pertinent measurements as reported in their chart but the delivered item was much tighter than expected. This is for slimmer builds."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Label size refers to Asian sizing system,4,"My only negative comment at this point (just received) is that the online description doesn’t clearly outline the definition of size. I was initially shocked and irritated that the label says 3XL when I ordered L. Only after thoroughly reading the online info did I discover the explanation that the label refers to the Asian size, where 3XL is equivalent to US size L.I’m generally pleased with the fit and construction and consider this a good value, providing that it proves as durable as it seems."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Very Pleasantly Surprised,5,"I have to admit I was sceptical, but with the offer of free returns I was ready to try it.  The jacket fits perfectly.  I wear a large and ordered a large as suggested.  It also looks great and I've worn it in mid 40 degree weather and it's perfect for that.  Exactly what I was looking for."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Really nice jacket,5,"I ordered an XXL. I’m 5’10”, have a 46 inch chest and a 38 inch waist, and this jackets fits perfectly. It’s not a super warm jacket, but it’s good in the chilly mornings. It does collect/attract tiny particles, pet hairs, wife hairs (those really long ones you can’t grab on the first time), and dust. So, have a lint roller/hair remover at hand every time you go out with it on. Pockets are good in size and placement. It’s manufacturing/stitching is sturdy and feels strong."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Great for the fashion forward time traveler,4,"The sleeves are a little short but it appears that this was an intentional design choice. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not at first, it's very ""busy"" with lots of buttons, military uniform style shoulder straps, etc. But if you don't mind looking a little bit like an 80s pop star it's pretty cool, and you definitely can't beat the price."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,"Great Choice, Well Made Jacket",5,"My husband selected this jacket. And because of his beer belly, I didn't think it was the best jacket for him. But I went ahead and ordered it for his Xmas gift. Wow to my surprise it was the best selection he's ever made. I've been a seamstress the majority of my life and This jacket is very well made with very warm insulation. The fabric is durable and the color is perfect for him. He's been very very pleased with this selection. We will buy another color soon."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,"Stylish, warm, and well-made with many pockets. My favorite jacket!",5,"My picky sweetie thinks it looks great on me and I agree. It's perfect for late fall and early winter temperatures in Wisconsin, down to about 15F = -10C over a tee, a flannel shirt, and a cotton sweater vest. Sturdy construction and materials. Men typically carry no purses, so I like having all the pockets. It was instantly my favorite jacket as soon as I put it on the first time. I will always look for a chance to wear it!"
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Junk. - The fit is bizzare,1,"I am 5'10"" tall, 148 pounds and have a 31"" waist.  Pretty normal and proportional dimensions...I generally can cope with ""asian"" sizing... but this was more like ET sizing... the arms were cut for guys who have twigs for arms! I dont have giant bicepts... hell I wish I did! but even a normal guy like me could hardly get his arms into these things.The wasit was also absurdely long..like the thing was cut for ""String Bean"" off of Hee-Haw..."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Way too long,3,"This jacket is way off on the length. I mean like 10"" longer than it should be. I bought it to fly in airplanes, but it's not usable.  But, I  didn't return it because for the money I  can keep it in the trunk, just in case some of my passengers forgot a jacket on a wi dy day.Quality of construction is good though, that's why 3 stars instead of 1."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Great jacket,5,"The feel, comfort, and quality of the jacket are great. I really like it, so much so that I'm not sending it back even though it is *slightly* too small. I mean barely, it's just barely a bit tight around my big ol' gut, so if you want form fitting I'd say get the same size. But if you want it to be a little loose-fitting, maybe go a size up. Otherwise, I absolutely love the jacket."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,"Get it here, not through FB",5,"This jacket is awesome, i got the xl, probably could have gotten away with the large, but this jacket is sweet. Its a medium weight i would say, and it feels and looks great. I keep seeing ads for them on FB at other places for $80. Buy it here. *update, the zipper pocket in the tan version is fake..but on the green jacket its a real pocket. Just FYI"
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Nice,4,"Nice jacket, not to heavy, so if you're expecting to survive a winter blizzard with this jacket, that's not going to happen. I ordered the Khaki an it's a little lighter in color then the picture but not a big deal for me. the zippered top pockets are faux but all the others are usable. The only thing is the zipper is on the left which takes a minute or two to get used to. Other then that, I'm pleased with the fit and style of the jacket."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Decent quality but short sleeves.,3,"This jacket is of decent quality for the price. I am 6 ft. Tall and about 175 lbs. I am slim with a used to be in shape, softer, dad bodish type build. I ordered a medium, and everything fits good except for sleeve length. If I stretch my arms out the sleeves are about 2 in. too short.  The zipper on the left is weird, but not as big a deal as some are making it out to be.  If the sleeves were longer, this would be a 4 star. Great for T-Rex type arms."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,"All and All this was an ""Awesome Purchase""",5,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   This jacket fits so well, it's my style and it's very affordable, the only issue I have with this purchase is that it wasn't the color I ordered. The packages label said blue but the jacket on the inside of package was Dark Grey."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Great jacket.,5,Great jacket material around wrists is nice and thick has a good stretch to it. Well made jacket goes a little over the butt which is great. Put a t-shirt on and lift up the collar and you are good to go.  Very cool.. I also love all the zippers and all the pockets. Fantastic value.
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,"Nicely made, lightly structured",5,"A little darker blue than the picture and the pockets are a tad shallow. Otherwise, fits well and nicely made. Exactly what my husband wanted. Lightly structured and slightly fitted."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,The sizing chart is a joke,3,"Previously ordered a large,tag 3XL, It fit like a US extra large,huge in the chest,baggy in the waist, returned . got medium,tag XL, it fit like US medium, chest real close and sleeves too short. I have a US size medium china made jacket and it measures out very close to the medium  on the sizing chart, but the jacket I got was closer to the small on the sizing chart. I think the china tag 2XL may be closer to a US medium . I love the jackets, but I have returned 3 of them because of sizing issues, I am 6,3. 190, slender build. I think I have given up on ordering , its too frustrating.I hope chrysully reads this and actually measures their jackets and get them close to the sizing chart"
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,All the pockets are functional,5,"I bought this a size smaller than I expected to fit me for incentive to drop a few pounds. This worked out perfect. It's a little tight and uncomfortable at my current weight, but not so much that I can't wear it. I got the XL and I'm currently pushing 250. I'm impressed with the quality for the price. Feels like it should last a couple of seasons of regular wear."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Coolest jacket ever,5,Personally I love this coat I'm 6-2 195 lb and I bought a large it still fits more than good enough but I would have bought an XL if I knew better just for people in the future. Regardless I'm still very satisfied with how it fits and the purpose it will serve. It's a great code to throw underneath perhaps a big winter coat like a Carhartt. It's also a great cool weather jacket and I believe it could work well in winter if you're well layered with thermals. But besides the high-quality aspects it just looks super cool and it's my favorite coat now.
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Buy it large.,3,"It isn't very warm, so buy it large enough to layer.  The zipper tab is on the left instead of the right.  It isn't my favorite coat, but it's good enough to keep."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,"It's nice, but a tad big.",4,"The jacket is nice and my husband loves it. However, it seems to run just a bit big. My husband wears only size Large in clothing, so I of course ordered the Large. But it seems to be just a tad big. He's 5'8 and 190-200lbs (more muscle weight and the jacket was still a tiny bit baggy)."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Size is as depicted in chart.,4,"Little early to start wearing jacket, but my first observation is I was impressed with appearance.  Size was according to chart.  Color as shown in pics.  My climate is such that I have no need for heavy outer wear so don't anticipate a problem in that area.  So far so good.......good price."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Surprisingly comfortable!,5,"I've got broad shoulders, long torso.  Average going on muscular build.  Never get good fit in chest/shoulders and things that do fit are usually exceptionally 'baggy' around the midsection.  This is a very good fit!"
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Goood quality,5,Good quality jacket.  Even more so for the price range.Fit is a bit tight around the chest but that was expected.Cloth so far has proven durable.May or may not serve your needs in the colder parts of winter but worked fine for mine (minimal time outdoors in cold weather).  Wearing this any time I need a jacket but not a heavy coat.
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Can't Wait for Cool Weather to wear it!,5,Seems to fit quite well and love the overall style so am looking forward to cold weather to wear it!
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,"The shipping process is very,very slow, which is not GOOD!!!",4,"Four star's due to the long time for the item to be shipped, since the seller was in New Jersey. I had to call Amazon for an explanation, which when given was not very good, however when ordering, get a size larger. The inner liner is very thin. The jacket fits well and the pockets are good, nice color."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Not quality of photo,2,Not as pictured in photo. Disappointed in the quality they sent. It was not the item they had photoed. Disappointed.
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,"Order a hair larger than you think. I’m 6 foot and 175, large was perfect.",5,"Other than the chest zippered pockets are a fake. Chest flap, hand and interior pocket... real and functional. Nice fit and good looking gear."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Buy one size smaller then you normally wear.,5,"I'm 5' 8"" 164 lbs and normally buy a large in stores but here it's best to buy one size smaller then you are. Fits perfectly around my chest and waist not to tight not to loose, I'm able to wear a hoodie with no discomfort."

CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Sweet!,5,I wish the zipper was metal.  Other then that it's a great jacket.
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,"Great product, amazing find.",5,I am 6’1” and weigh 190 lbs. and so I ordered the jacket in Medium and the fit wasn’t as snug as I usually wear my jackets or sweaters. I may buy another one in SMALL just to compare. The quality is GREAT though. Thick and warm and all around such a nice buy for the price. Diamond in the rough for sure
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Nice quality jacket,4,I really like the jacket.  It's a tiny bit smaller than I expected.  Good quality looks very nice. Great for fall and spring.

CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Looks good but has poor craftsmanship,4,"Measurements are good and accurate.

CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Poor quality,1,"I'm 5'8"" 170 lbs. As soon as I pulled it out of it's zip lock bag a button rivet came flying off.I bought the large but the right arm was as if someone twisted the lining 360 degrees THEN sewn it to the sleeve, I couldn't even get my arm through. Made in China, go figure."

CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Decent well-fitting cool weather jacket,4,"This jacket LOOKS GOOD, especially when you get the right fit, and it fits well. It seems to be well made, and it should last a number of years. This jacket is more stylish than pragmatic, since it only has a few pockets and they are a bit shallow, but it is a nice jacket. It is best suited for spring or fall, definitely not a winter jacket unless you layer underneath it. All in all very satisfied and I now have a nice ""going out"" jacket to put on when I want to look extra nice with my hunny on a date or social event."
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,It’s good,5,A little brag but I was expecting it to fit bulky people more. A little tight on the chest and loose on the waist. Also wish it was longer. It’s a great jacket overall and looks great
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Buying on line,5,Haven't had it too long to really judge it  but the quality seems decent. The extra large seems a bit too large for me. I am 6' 180 lbs but without trying on the large I don't know which is the correct size. The dilemma  of buying on line.
CRYSULLY Men Cotton Multi Pocket Stand Collar Outdoor Coat Lightweight Military Jackets Navy/US L/Tag 3XL,Quality jacket with good style but not too much warm.,4,is great for casual wearing.

"Nautica Men's Hooded Parka Jacket, Water and Wind Resistant",runs very large,3,"jackets runs a size to 1.5 sizes too big.I run between a large and medium so I ordered a medium and theres about 6 inches of play in the jacket. Its the first jacket where i physically said out loud ""this jacket needs a belt"". it feels like an xl almost on me.Im about the same exact size as the guy in the ad photo for the navy blue jacket.

Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Buy it!!!,5,"It is a loose jacket so I’m not sure if we should have taken that into account when we purchased it. It’s definitely baggy if you order the size that you usually order, even if you wear something under it. Other than that, the jacket is fantastic! Love the material and the warmth and the style! I actually kept the extra large and gave it away as a gift and re-purchased my husband a large because we loved it so much!"
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Love it (People are CORRECT about the size)... ZIPPERED POCKETS,5,"Picture doesn't look like it but the outer side pockets have zippers. I dont see any inner pockets inside the jacket as some review mentions. Maybe it was for a different style..I have the other UA jacket that looks like this but has a third zipper pocket on the chest. Its a Large. This medium is slightly bigger than the large of that jacket variant. It still fits great and nice material. I almost didn't buy this one since they didn't offer a Large Size (only Medium and XL), but then I read reviews and everyone said Medium is Large. YEP. I've tried all the brands of jackets in this style and I think UA is one of the best in fit and material."
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Great fit and keeps you warm,5,"Great jacket. Keeps me warm during morning walks when it’s 30-40 degrees Fahrenheit outside. If warn with multiple layers it gets hot very easily. For example, I wouldn’t wear it over a shirt and sweater. Also a good choice because it can still be used for business casual wear—doesn’t look overly sporty or too informal. I wear it to the office with a button down shirt and it looks fashionably acceptable."
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Black is not Black,3,"I gave 3 stars because for some reason Under Armor has no clue what the color black is. Black is black, but to Under Armor black means kinda blue but kinda gray sorta black with a hint of purple. When I want a black jacket I want a black jacket not one that changes colors. The jacket is nice but the color is horrible does not match the photo at all."
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Keeps the heat in.,4,"Really great jacket, I work in a grocery market so it's cold ALL THE TIME. Also, I have to go in the freezer sometime and this jacket really keeps me warm throughout the day. The only issue is the inside lining of the pockets. Obviously sometimes I place my keys in my jacket pocket and I noticed that they've already poked a few holes in the jacket. Other then that really great jacket."
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Ok But Not a Woven Fabric as Appears in Photos,3,"From the pictures, I thought this was going to be more of a softer woven light jacket.  The shell is more like a stiff windbreaker - very synthetic but not as flexible as a standard windbreaker.  I expect I'll find a use for it someday, but I'm not using it for a light jacket in my chilly workplace as intended."
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Runs a size too big,2,I am 5 ft 11 165 lb I ordered a small and it fits like a medium. The jacket is relatively warm but it is unattractive to look at. Looks much better in the photos
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Great Soft Shell Jacket!,5,"This Product was a little big! However, I took it to a tailor and they were able to take it in just right for me! Great product! I even got it embroidered!"
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Inside Pockets could be higher,4,Jacket is niceWish the inside pockets here higher chest level for walletsThe lower inside pockets are only accessible when unzipped and or reaching into deep. Plus add to bulk i adding more stuff in outer front pockets
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Runs true to size.,5,The Jacket fits my husband perfectly.  True to size. He is very happy with it.
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Forget This Jacket If you Have a Paunch,4,"I would regard this jacket as being slim-fit, which I am not. I returned it. Otherwise, a nice jacket."
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Sexy,5,"Very nice, really liked the pattern . Gave it a little dressier look than plain black"
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Waterproof and aclimates to your body temp,5,Keeps you warm bit if it warms up you dont sweat. Love it
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Comfortable & warm happy fit...,5,Great price fits & looks great!
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Not impressed,3,Nice looking jacket but I’m not in love with it.  I have long arms and the arm length is too long (I purchased a size medium). Only other compliant is the shell doesn’t block wind too well.  I have a jacket I purchased from Costco a few years ago for $35 that fits better and blocks wind better than this jacket.
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Size is off,1,Item was too large.  I ordered a medium and it fit like a large.
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Beautifully designed.,5,Beautifully designed.  Waiting to test these in the fall/winter
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,UA Jacket doesn't disappoint,5,"Very good jacket, and keeps you warm in the rain/wind."
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Amazing,5,"Jacket sizes run loose. Usually a Large in jackets, I ordered a Medium and it fits perfect. I wear this jacket every day nowEasily my favorite jacket now"
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,He loved it! (a little long in the sleeve) but GREAT fit,5,Just right as an XL no need to buy a sz up! looks great and it's warm enough for Minnesota. Love UnderArmor brand feel&fit!
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,"Good, Not Great",3,"Somewhat disappointing. For one thing, the Minimalist name is a misnomer.  It is not minimalist in weight. Weighs almost a pound in the XL size. Heavier than I expected. The jacket runs a little large and the sleeves run way too long. Also, the sleeves are sloppy with room. And not enough velcro on the main front zipper; only one velcro at the top and a metal snap button at the bottom. Needs a couple more velcro up and down the zipper to make sure no water leaks in during a windy rain. Also, the front chest pocket doesn't have any protection over the zipper for rain protection. It's only water resistant, not waterproof. I wouldn't put an ID or passport or cell phone in there in rainy weather. The hood cannot be hidden. But it has a nice stiff brim to keep water off your face. And the jacket doesn't fold into a stuff pocket. It is large when folded or rolled up to fit into a pack or luggage. I did the shower test on it to see if is absorbed water or leaked. The first test it was wet inside in the upper back. I re-tested later and it was dry. So water may have leaked in around the neck the first time. This jacket is just a rain and wind shell. No lining. The inside has plastic like cold feel if you don't wear a warm long sleeve shirt underneath. My size according to the manufacturer's size chart is in between a Large and Extra Large. I opted for the extra large so there would be room for layering. But the sleeves are still way too long. Covers my complete hands and fingers. I had thought about returning it for a Large, but I think a Large might be too tight with layers of clothing. In cold weather it would be good to wear a fleece jacket under this rain shell. There are a lot of nice features such as  storm flaps over the side pockets and arm pit zips for ventilation. I haven't used it in rain yet, so don't know about breathability. The Minimalist is a basic Gore-Tex Paclite design. A step up from that would be much more money. All in all it's not the best jacket, but is pretty good. Better quality would be a lot more money. Still, I expected better for the money. There are budget alternatives for less money and I have one from REI for summer use. But I wanted a step up from that. I hope I got that. I will know after use in some wind and rain."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Great rain jacket (so far),5,"The first thing I did when I got the Marmon Minimalist jacket was to pair it with rain pants and stand under my shower for about 2 minutes. I emerged completely dry; so far so good. I like the hood design with a good-sized brim which kept the wet from my face, and the medium fit was good for my 5'11"", 180 lb, 42"" chest body. The sleeve length was perfect, and I like the velcro closures at the wrist.The next thing I did was use the jacket over a polar fleece as I used my snowblower to clear my driveway in the latest east coast blizzard. The main reason I wanted a new waterproof jacket is that I always get completely covered in blown-back snow when I use the snowblower, and none of my previous jackets kept me dry. This jacket was perfect at keeping me dry and warm during the 90 minutes I spent clearing the property.I am very happy with the jacket so far and will update as I have more experience."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,WOW WOW!  QUALITY JACKET!,5,"The photos and description of this jacket absolutely do NOT accurately describe how well made and cool this jacket is!!!  First thing that surprised me on opening was how vibrant the color was!  The pics show the Navy to be washed out, but its a very nice, deep blue color, and the brighter blue accents and embroidery really contrast well!  Had purchased a North Face jacket for an upcoming trip to London (Fingers Crossed!) but this Marmot is absolutely making the trip with me!  Every detail says quality!!!  So VERY HAPPY I tried this jacket as an alternative before my return window closed on the North Face jacket!Note:  I am 5'9"", 188 LB and the large fits well...if you were over 210-220 LB you might find the large too tight in the stomach and chest."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Still dry despite heavy rain during my trip riding a scooter home,5,"I'm impressed with the material, unlike my old Marmot, which was thin and the seam lining has fallen off after 3 years of wearing it daily.I'm still bone dry when I reached home after my 30 minutes ride home by my motorbike. Although this rain coat is not meant for motorcycle riders, but it works fine and the material is gortex which is thick, when the heavy rain falls on my raincoat, it beads off which means the gortex really repelling the rain effectively.I thought I will eventually get wet because I didn't zip up all the way up, I just let the zipper zipped to my throat level and surprisingly I'm still dry , the zipper sealant is really good."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Great GORE-TEX Jacket for a Great Price.,4,"Overall, this jacket is a wonderful purchase for the price point. The reviews that critique the GORE-TEX seem to be more about the DWR (water-repellent coating) which is not part of the GORE-TEX water-resistance. Admittedly, when I first got the jacket and tested it, watching the water bead up and fall off was extremely satisfying, and when it stopped working after a few days, I myself was concerned with if the negative reviews were correct. However, it was important to note that just because the DWR began to come off and wasn’t causing the water to bead off, water still wasn’t permeating the GORE-TEX. This jacket most definitely lives up to it’s promise, as I have worn it extensively in heavy rain and snow and have yet to find myself even the slightest bit wet.As far as sizing, the fit of the jacket was very nice (I typically wear S/M hoodies and got a Medium) it was very clearly an over-jacket. Although the jacket could be worn for everyday use on it’s own depending on the size purchased, it works the best with a nice under-layer.Overall, great jacket, definitely deserves 4.5 or 5 stars."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Love this jacket,5,"I've owned this jacket for a few months now. It's a little bulky, which makes it difficult to pack down if lightweight is your priority. But the material is solid, and the jacket is comfortable. I bike to work and hike a lot, so I'm exposed to the rain a great deal. I've been poured on while commuting or hiking through the woods many times now, and there is no better endorsement of this jacket than how well it held up in these experiences. I'm having a hard time imagining my life before it. It's been a wonderful investment."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Don’t buy this jacket! It is not waterproof.,1,Don’t buy this jacket!My left arm was exposed to light rain while in an open taxi on a recent trip. I had done my research and used Marmot and goretex items before so when I read some negative reviews about this jacket I thought they were just exceptions to their generally good quality. Unfortunately the negative reviews were very accurate. When I got to the hotel I found that the light rain had soaked through my sleeve. That should not happen with goretex and Marmot quality.  I’m extremely disappointed! The biggest bummer is I bought the  jacket to be prepared for the trip and returned yesterday to find I’m one day too late to return It. Don’t buy this jacket! If you are sold on Marmot (I was) buy it from a store where the manufacturers may return or replace the defective jacket.
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Excellent rain jacket,5,"Smartly designed jacket with quality fit and finish.  Hood protects face well and is adjustable.  Medium size is loose enough for insulating base layers but not too large without them ( I am 5'10"" and 160 lbs).  Drawstring waist, adjustable velcro cuffs and zippered hand pockets, also with velcro closures.  Single zippered chest pocket and underarm ventilation with zippers.  This is just what I was looking for in a Gore-Tex product especially since it was on sale at 41% off list of $189.00."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Great fitting jacket with the quality I expect from Marmot,5,"I picked up this jacket when it was on sale, I wasn't quite sure what to expect but the quality far exceeded my expectations.The seams are fully taped for water resistance.It's a little heavier weigh than some of my other rain jackets so I'm not sure how it will be for summer weather but it has vents under the arms to let heat escape.I'm 5'11 190 and a large fits perfect, the cuffs are slim but give you enough room to not restrict movement."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,A Terrific Replacement and Packable,5,"I originally purchased this Jacket in a Medium. I'm 5'6"" and 170 lbs. The medium was too small. This Large fits great. I've had this type of GORE-TEX jacket previously and know that they're great in the rain and wind. I found this jacket is also packable into the small stuff sack that came with my previous jacket. The pockets zip and the zipper is sturdy. This will be a great addition to my travel wardrobe."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,"Quality, Well Designed Shell - Very Fast Shipping.",5,"The Marmot Minimalist shell is well designed and attractive jacket.  The extra large is about 25"" pit to pit and about 29"" from the hood seam to the rear hem.  I wear a size 44 sport coat and it fits well with room for a layer.  The fabric is light weight and thin.  It does repel the rain (tested for 30 minutes in a moderate rain storm), but I would be careful of wearing it in thick brush or skiing if you are concerned about falling.  The vendor shipped very quickly."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Good Rain Jacket,5,"This is a nice fitting and nice looking Gore-Tex rain jacket. It has a quality to it that makes it a bargain at $130.Given that I live in Southern AZ, rain is not an issue, but heat is. I wear this for winter hiking and find that it doesn't build a ton of heat. The pit zips also help."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Not very waterproof,1,I have only worn this jacket twice. The first time was just in a light drizzle so didn't notice water coming through. The second time was a pretty good down pour. The jacket leaked at the front zipper and several seams were damp. It didn't seem to do much better than a regular nylon jacket. I also wore a pair of old Gore Tex pants that did a better job of keeping me dry and they were over twenty years old.Unfortunately I didn't wear the jacket right away so I am past the time to be able to return it.
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Beware of Defects,3,"I purchased this a number of weeks ago but just wore if for the first time recently and was disappointed to find a hairline scratch on the back. Not sure if it will really make much of a difference or if I’ll send it back but make sure you inspect it very closely when you get it. Otherwise, I really like it."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,My son loves it,5,Bought it for my son and he loves it. Nothing beat Gortex tbh. If you take care of it it will last for many years. And since it’s so expensive you will take better care of it. The only thing more waterproof might be rubber
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,This jacket looks really good,4,"This is a good-looking and well-made coat with a good quality zipper. Fit is fine (large) but the sleeves are a tad long. The velcro cuffs make that manageable. Haven't been out in a soaker, but no reason to expect problems. Seams are neatly sealed, and it does have a Gore-Tex lining. If it had a stowable hood it would be perfect for me."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Super lightweight and breathable,5,"This is the perfect rain jacket for typical late winter/early spring weather. It’s very lightweight, great for hiking, normal activities and is very breathable. True to size as well."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Very nice lightweight rain jacket,5,"This is a great lightweight shell rain jacket with hood. It fits a little oversized, so if you’re looking for a more fitted “urban” jacket I’d downsize. I’m 6’ 170 and it was pretty loose fitting me. Well made. Nice fabric and color. Will last many years."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,It works,5,This is the real deal. It's a great rain coat.
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Solid Build Quality.  I feel so cool in this Jacket!!,5,"Love this jacket.If you're in the market for a solid rain jacket this one is great! I was lucky enough to get it on sale around $80, but would easily pay $100+ knowing the quality now"
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Best Quality Raincoat be none,5,"This is the best raincoat. I bike around NYC and need to go out rain or shine for work. This coat, paired with a good pair of rain pants, in a the best I’ve ever had. Dry and warm (though I am a polar bear and always warm) even in a downpour. Get this coat even if you have to pay a little more."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Runs large,3,Runs extremely large. I got a small (my normal size) and it fit like an xxxl. Huge.
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,So far So good !,5,"I haven’t had my jacket in a all day down pour , but had it in a cold rain ( 50s) kept me warm and dry. If you want a good reference, Feathers and IB tat ( trail names) are both using this jacket on the PCT in Washington"
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Great jacket!,5,Very nice rain jacket. Definitely good at repelling rain. Love the adjustable cuffs. Very lightweight. Rain just beads off and doesn't let rain go through the jacket.
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Great shell for Walking/Hiking in rainy conditions,4,"I can walk in all kinds of weather, just add or reduce layers depending on temp.  The shell, with Goretex fabric, is very water repellent versus shells with the spray-on type of repellent.  My only criticism is that I initially ordered a Medium for $113. It was a little small so I exchanged it for a Large, and the price increased to $183.  $70 for an upgrade in size seems a little steep."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,returned because sleeves were too long,2,My husband liked the jacket except for the extra long sleeves.  He demanded that I return it.
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Win like a warlock,5,"Nice California coast activity shell. Chest pocket wins, underarm zipper perfect for cooling, Gortex for real. Winning."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Jacket fits great - Great protection against rain/wind,5,This jacket is pretty lightweight and fits great. The waterproofing is amazing as it's GoreTex. I play a lot of golf in the rain and hike in the snow/rain as well and this jacket is built perfectly for the wet elements.
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Great jacket!,5,My brother wore it to the snow and it’s waterproof and warm!
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,You husband wil love this!,5,"I bought this jacket as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He loves it.  It keep the wind and water from bothering him.  He has worn it several times on the golf course and every time he comes home he raves about it.  He is tall and the Extra Large Tall size allows him to put a heavy layer underneath on cold days.  The sleeves are a perfect fit for his long arms, and the hood keeps him sheltered from wind and rain.  He loves this, so I am happy!"
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Gift,5,This was a Christmas gift and pleased my grandson. He loves it.

Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Best parka ever,5,"I've been skiing for over 50 years, and this is the warmest, best parka I have ever owned.  It is very light, yet will keep you warm as a bug in a rug, and, so far, it is surprisingly waterproof.  It was worth all the trouble and hassle I went through in their online ordering and customer service issues."

Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,gore tex paclite,5,"cumple la funcion de proteger contra lluvia ligera, pero lluvia fuerte no, creo que la chaqueta absorbe el agua acumulado y se pasa al interior por eso se mira mojado despues de la lluvia, por el precio esta bien y por ser la version paclite"

Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,High quality Gore tex Rain Jacket,5,"I've had two of these. One I got maybe 5 years ago and It was excellent enough that when I came across the very same jacket here on Amazon I jumped at the purchase.In that 5 or so years literally nothing about the jacket has changed. Lining it up alongside my first only revealed how much use I had gotten out of it. They are identical. This is not a bad thing. I do like upgrades and new fixes or whatnot but as it is there aren't any needed.The fit is complimentary, a bit longer would be alright but not a deal breaker. The jacket is thin sure however layering it appropriately for your conditions makes it more than adequately warm. If I've anything I don't like it's that it can be too warm for me here in the MN winters with a thin down jacket underneath I'm sweating within a short time especially when shopping inside. The trade off for a completely dry, fully waterproof shell is well worth it. I have really put these through the ringer in real world conditions. Summer torrential downpours to heavy, wet long nights doing snow removal and never have I had any problems. This idea that a shower test is even close to a good idea is crazy. The psi driving warm water directly through mechanisms in your plumbing and plumbing fixtures (showerheads) designed to increase the pressure of said water while standing inches away from the source is in no way shape or form similar to anything you'll ever actually come across in natural conditions. I'm sorry but I really find it humorous to think of you guys doing your ""shower tests"" at home then jumping online to leave your findings. Yikes...Anyway Marmot is quality stuff. You really can't go wrong with anything Goretex which when used actually comes with its own tags and warranties attached which ought to inspire confidence on its own. Not that it doesn't have it's unique properties one may or may not like but it does what it says period.Bottom line this is a high quality, highly specific type of waterproof shell style jacket. It works well, looks good and takes a beating while maintaining its integrity. Fit and feel are always subjective but you know this already.I recommend this product fully"
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Gore-Tex is water proof,5,I got my usual size and it fits well.  I am happy with the color and the cuffs that Velcro to keep out the cold and the pit zips that let out heat. Gore Tex is military grade! We used it in the service.

Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,Marmot,5,Really like rain jacket
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"I bought this jacket in summer 2018. It is look nice, it is big enough to layering and the feel is nice.  Because a dry summer I did not use it for months, trusting that a well known brand like Marmot would have strict quality test.First time I used in light rain, I noticed after 15/ 20 min that in parts of the jacket the textile start to saturate, so you could feel it dump and the inner layer become dark in colour meaning it was getting wet. it is mostly in hood, shoulders and arms.I gave it another chance and this happened again.I called Marmot Europe Customer service and nobody reply that phone...ever. So I wrote them explaining the issue.I received a extremily condescendent reply, stating it was condensation what I could feel and see. I never did any effort to sweat wearing this jacket and if after 10 min walk to my bus stop it created condensation it means the Gore Tex membrane is rubish when they are trying to sell its brathibility. I gave it another chance making sure it did not have a chance to generate condensation. the Jacket got saturated because the rain in 10 min. Wrote Marmot again and this time......not even an answer. Even more annoying, I tried to write a review in their website and they refused to publish it. So now, I am stuck with an expensive windbreaker( this jacket is not waterproof) and the feeling that Marmot do not care about their customers. For sure it is the last time I am buying Marmot. I hope this review will help people in case they are doubting if buying it or not."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Already had a heavy Gore Tex coat with fleece lining for winter use. Wanted a light weight coat to be worn over T shirt for the wet summer days walking my dogs. This coat is perfect in that role, fits exactly as expected and has faced some heavy downpours already and is 100% waterproof. My advise to anyone wanting to wear a fleece or similar under the jacket is to choose a size larger than you would normally go for."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"After buying a Gore Tex Paclite jacket when they first appeared, I never thought I would buy one again. The original Paclite was very prone to wetting out. Whilst the material was breathable, it was very easy to overwhelm the material to the point it could not expel moisture quickly enough, so it ended up condensing inside the jacket.This jacket is using a much newer version of the material and I haven't experienced the issues I had with the original material. Also, price was very good on Amazon, which is why I took a chance on this jacket."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"I Like the price,the minimalist look,being Gore Text,breathable,wind prof, light wait,well made,nice rain hood & its adjustable.Don,t like that it's a bit to long in the arms,no pockets inside,unable to hide hood would of been nice if you were able to tuck it away,no carrying bag to put it into.So after all this I Still like it am 5 foot 8 inch or 1.72cm I got it in size L good fit."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"At the time of writing this review in Apr 2021, there are two listings for the men's Marmot Minimalist jacket with Amazon.ca as seller:The older style Marmot Minimalist can be found by searching  ASIN B078WFHR5Y in the Amazon.ca search.The newer style Marmot Minimalist can be found by searching ASIN B07V5R1XH2 under the Amazon.ca search.This review was posted under the old style, ASIN  B078WFHR5Y, but includes info on the new style as I purchased both to compare.The old style Minimalist is the much superior jacket. The fit of both (old and new style) hasn't changed, but there are design changes that make the old better.Pluses+ The Minimalist (old or new style) are one of the least expensive, if not the least expensive Gore Tex jackets you'll find. (Mar 2021 purchase time)+ Main zipper closure on the old style Minimalist is meatier and better than the new Minimalist, and the old style is a right handed (men's style) closure.+ Old style Minimalist breast pocket is on the wearer's left side (for right handed people) and is seam taped.+ Both old and new style have pit zips+ Branding logos and writing on the old style Minimalist is sewn on, not stamped / printed on like the new style+ Sleeve length is generous in L / XL sizes for both old and new style. Great for guys 6' and over.+ Waist on both old and new style has an elastic closure that can be cinched up.+ The hood has an elastic that can be cinched up at the rear of the hood. Hood peak is also generous, great if you wear glasses.+ It's kept me dry in my initial tests in BC rainy weather. Water beaded off.+ Relatively breathable (more on that below)+ The name describes it. It's just a 'minimalist', nice looking jacket. Both old and new style Minimalist.Negatives- No inner pockets on old or new style Minimalist- No way to store the hood on old or new style Minimalist. Not even a roll up stow or closure.- Hem length is just below hip height on old and new Minimalist (not 3/4) and this might be too short for some. I found it no prob for me on Lrge or XL size @ 6'Details:The old style Minimalist has what I consider to be the much better zippers compared to the new style Minimalist. It uses a thicker, meatier (albeit plastic) main zipper that catches and closes easier, and zips up / runs easier. So helpful when wearing gloves. The new style Minimalist has a thinner main zipper that is unfortunately a more common trend on newer jackets; I find they tend to be prone to closure problems over time and can be finicky if you're wearing gloves.Neither the old or new style Minimalist main zipper is seam taped. Both rely on a flap closure for waterproof protection of the main zipper and the flap does a good job of staying closed over the zipper and providing water proof protection. The zipper flap stays in place no problem even without velcro or snap closures.The main zipper on this old style Minimalist closes right to left, the usual norm for most men's clothing and is considered a right handed closure. Contrast that with the new style men's Minimalist jacket zipper that closes left to right, more common on women's clothing, and is considered a left handed closure.This old style Minimalist has the breast pocket on the wearer's left side, which means the pocket and it's zipper are more accessible for right handed people. This old style has a seam taped zipper which works here as it's easily accessible and it runs / zips easily. No fuss. The new style Minimalist breast pocket is on the wearer's right side (better access for left handed people) and it's not seam taped. It's got a flap closure. Again ...  the zippers / closures on this old style Minimalist are just far better all around.The pit zips are the same on both the old and new style Minimalist and both work fine. They are not seam taped and don't need to be as they're out of the way.You can see the hem length from my attached pics. I found the hem length on the Lrge or XL was fine for me @ 6'  205lbs, especially because it has an elastic that can be cinched if needed. I found hem length fine even riding my bike.I've owned other Marmot jackets and I find Marmot's are generous on sleeve length, including this Minimalist, which is great for guys 6' and over.A word on fit:For reference I'm 6'0"" tall and 205 lbs.The fit is 'regular' (non tapered).I bought the Lrge and XL in both old and new style intending to compare and just keep the one that fit best.The best fit for me @ 6' 205 lbs was the Large size (old or new style). The sleeves were about perfect, even with arms raised. The chest and waist fit well. This was with a medium or thin layer / layers underneath. I think any guy that's 6', or even up to 6'2"" ish on the lean side (200lbs or under) would easily do well with a Large.That said, I kept the XL. Why? Because at 6' 205 lbs I'm a little on the heavier side in the waist and chest. When I added a thicker fleece or puffer vest underneath in the Large size, the natural hang fit was still good, but as soon as I got active it was slightly constricting in the chest / underarm area. And I do mean slightly. I wanted it to be completely non-restrictive with a thick layer underneath. With a thin layer underneath, the fit of the XL is slightly bulky on me (not bad just slightly), but I don't mind that at all. It's still perfectly fine using the waist and sleeve cinches. This is purely a matter of personal preference. I still think most lean fit guys in the 6' - 6'2"" range would be happy with a Large.A word on the Gore Tex / DWR / water proofing protection:Marmot uses their Pac Lite Gore Tex technology. Product pictures show three overall jacket layers, but it states: ""A protective layer on the inside of the GORE TEX membrane makes a separate lining unnecessary. The result: minimum weight and pack volume"".The Minimalist is also a DWR garment (durable water repellent). DWR is a thin layer of liquid applied to the exterior of garments to to repel oil, grease, dirt and water. The theory is that DWR is less prone to 'wet out' or saturation. I won't speak to the science of this but I do know that to test it, just drop water on the jacket and see if it beads up. If it doesn't you need to restore the DWR. It's a simple process.To restore DWR:- Machine wash the jacket no hotter than warm. Double rinse.- Line dry the jacket- Once it's dry, tumble dry on a warm, gentle cycle for 20 minutes to reactivate the DWR.This jacket is relatively breathable. If you're active in the rain eventually you'll get wet due to sweating, even with outstanding breathable rain protection. Best you can hope for is to mitigate that and use really good wicking layers next to the skin. Yes breathable gore text garments help to prevent / reduce wetness, but it's relative. For short or non exerting walks I'm bone dry in this jacket in the rain. Once I get active I sweat; but overall this jacket seems as breathable as any other gore text jacket I've had. No more, no less.I love this jacket so far. Price to performance you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal in a gore tex jacket, either online or in a brick and mortar store locally. The XL I kept was Amazon used warehouse that arrived in mint perfect condition with all new tags still attached.It came to $141 CAD after taxes shipped. That was more than $100 cheaper than any other gore text jacket I could find in my small city locally.Hope this helps. Happy jacket hunting!"
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"An effective waterproof as you would expect from Goretex/Marmot. My only complaint would be that the zips don't seem to be of the same quality as the fabric. Also the Men's jacket appears to fasten on the front zip on the women's side, or maybe I'm mistaken? It's certainly lightweight so it's ideal for summer and useful all year."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"AN excellent jacket at a good price! True, only the black option is available at this discount but I was ok with that. The hood has great adjustment allowing for fit and visibility with or without a hat; overall fit allows good movement and it's waterproofness is exemplary. Sleeves are perhaps a touch long but that's probably because I needed a slightly larger body  size now I'm no longer a youngster! Never used the pit zips (and probably won't!) so can pass no comment."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Great design and wind/shower proof, but certainly not waterproof. I have two which after a few uses have both begun to wet out even in light rain. Following GoreTex and Marmot's care ,  washing and reproofing instructions doesn't fix the issue. Avoid buying for hiking/backpacking - even in summer."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Superb jacket, already been used and abused in North Wales and it delivered!"
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,great lightweight waterproof coat. just what i was after
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,Very good. Im tall with broad shoulders and long arms. Fits me perfectly 👌
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,Well made. I use it to go walking on a rainy suumer day. But a bit too long in body.
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,Like everyone else says it fits big. I was trying to decide between a medium and large and I am very glad I went with the medium. Otherwise it is a great simple jacket and true to the colour
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,Fits well with lots of adjustment available for hood and waistline
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Really waterproof (goretex) really stylish the only problem, minor one, is its breathability after long walks or hikes"
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,it kept me dry even when the rain was heavy. can be folded to small volume. 3 pockets.
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,Top class. Can’t recommend enough
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Great jacket, very waterproof, good hood, good breathability, windproof. Looks good and lightweight."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Da poco ho cominciato ad andare al lavoro con il monopattino elettrico e nel giro di poco si è presentato il il problema della pioggia.Ho così cominciato a cercare una protezione valida contro la pioggia, non il classico poncho o k-way,ma qualcosa che fosse elegante, funzionale e che mi garantisse anche protezione per un'escursione giornaliera in totale tranquillità dal punta di vista meteo!Ecco che mi sono imbattuto su Marmot brand Americano tra i più quotati sull'outdoor che ha risposto pienamente alle mie esigenze!Traspira bene ,tiene il vento,il tessuto e molto resistente anche se vai adosso a rami nelle boscaglie ecc, e molto idroreppelente , in inverno al freddo conviene indossare un layer termico ulteriore, ricordarsi che veste grande io porto una m e ho dovuto prendere una S e già mi e lunga di maniche..."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Giacca molto bella e funzionale. Nonostante la leggerezza complessiva, le qualità che saltano subito all'occhio sono qualità e robustezza. La cerniera da un senso di solidità mentre scorre e una volta chiusa la sensazione che si avverte è quella di avere indosso un vero guscio protettivo. Il cappuccio avvolge molto bene, le tre regolazioni consentono eventualmente di fare aderire meglio il goretex alla testa, che nel caso di pioggia poco intensa può essere utile perchè consente di avere una visuale migliore. Tuttavia mi è capitato di usarla solamente in condizioni piuttosto estreme con raffiche di vento forti e fredde e pioggia battente che si evolveva ogni tanto in forti acquazzoni e ho preferito quindi tenere le regolazioni lasche per avere un riparo migliore. Veste larga per consentire un layer caldo al di sotto ma senza esagerare troppo: traspira ma è pur sempre impermeabile al 100%. Se usata per la corsa in montagna va bene anche una maglia a manica lunga sottile. Avendola usata spesso e molte ore di seguito mi sento di consigliarla, e se fosse possibile darei 6 stelle, non 5."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Ho preso questa giacca hard-shell per alcuni trekking in montagna. La qualità è ineccepibile, le finiture sono eccezionali, il materiale è robusto ed i dettagli sono curatissimi.Purtroppo l'ho restituita perché ha un taglio un po' strano ed ho optato per una The North Face Dryzzle che è quasi identica a questa giacca Marmot.La ragione di questa scelta? La TNF Dryzzle ha un materiale più leggero, è decisamente rifinita peggio ma veste meglio. La giacca Marmot è stretta e un po' corta sul busto mentre ha maniche molto larghe e lunghe, la The North Face veste un po' più comoda sul busto ed ha maniche meno abbondanti.Dovendola usare anche come giacca da città ho scelto di sacrificare la qualità per una vestibilità migliore, ma è stata una scelta assai sofferta perché la Marmot è palesemente più curata. Oltre ad avere un tessuto più spesso, la Marmot ha sigilli termosaldati all'interno delle cerniere per evitare infiltrazioni d'acqua e tanti altri piccoli dettagli che la The North Face non ha anche se ad uno sguardo superficiale le due giacche sembrano quasi identiche.In sintesi: Marmot Minimalist Jacket ha un eccezionale rapporto prezzo/qualità, la consiglio vivamente a chi ha intenzione di usarla principalmente o esclusivamente per le escursioni. Ha una vestibilità un po' strana, un po' fasciante sul busto e con maniche molto abbondanti che credo possa stare meglio a chi ha ha un fisico sportivo e braccia grosse o muscolose. Per chi come me fa sport solo occasionalmente e vuole una giacca da usare anche per la città forse la The North Face Dryzzle è una scelta più azzeccata anche se non ha la stessa qualità e impermeabilità."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Qualche info:Il primo Marmot modello Minimalist lo presi 9 anni fa circa, presi una M.Ora dopo vari anni il modello Minimalist è stato leggermente aggiornato sia come estetica (ad esempio la chiusura dei polsini ed il logo posteriore che prima era centrale, ora è laterale) e sia come taglio/vestibilità. Infatti la M provata in negozio qualche mese fa non mi vestiva come la M che indossavo in quel momento (quella di 9 anni fa), cosa confermata dal negoziante. Qui su Amazon ho preso la L ed è perfetta. E' un ottimo guscio per proteggere da vento ed acqua, ovvio dire che dopo 4..5 anni comincia a perdere quell'effetto che vedete subito dopo averlo acquistato dell'essere idrorepellente, MA E' NORMALE. La fibra del tessuto è formata da microscopici ""peli"" che stanno dritti (come quella del castoro ad esempio) in questo modo respingono l'acqua....dopo 4...5..6 anni il ""pelo"" si piega in basso...si ""affloscia"" e diminuisce questa caratteristica , ma come ripeto è normale. Dipende anche dall'uso che ne fate. Io il vecchio Minamalist l'ho usato sempre..montagna ...bici...uno spettacolo!!!"
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,It’s all good. Great lightweight jacket to keep the wind and rain off.
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,Fits well and so far has met my expectations
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Non ho ancora testato la giacca ""sul campo"", ma sembra un guscio solido e ben fatto. Molto bella la linea pulita ed il colore azzurro. La Marmot Minimalist è dotata di due tasche frontali molto ampie (una delle quali arriva fino ad altezza petto) ed una tasca pettorale con zip impermeabile , oltre che aperture di aerazione sotto le braccia apribili tramite cerniera.  Le regolazioni possibili sono moltissime, è un capo che sembra perfetto per proteggersi dalle intemperie.Si deve solo da fare attenzione alla taglia in quanto veste abbastanza abbondante. C'è infatti spazio per indossare strati sottostanti come pile e piumino se la si acquista della propria taglia. Sono 187 cm per 76kg, fisico asciutto ed ho scelto la taglia M."

   Jacke ist an sich gut verarbeitet, alle Nähte super gut getaped und Nähte und Reißverschlüsse sind auch sehr gut. Die Paclite Membran ist extrem glatt von innen, womit ein an und ausziehen super einfach geht. Jedoch musste ich nach einem Jahr gelegentliche aber nicht extreme Nutzung als Fahrradjacke nun feststellen, dass die Jacke undicht ist.Ich nutze sehr viele Outdoor Membranen im Sport und kann eine fehlerhafte Nutzung ausschließen, die Membran ist weder mit Weichspüler noch andere Chemikalien in Kontakt gekommen.Gepflegt wurde Sie nach Vorgaben nach dem mitgelieferten Goretex Booklet.Im Video ist zu sehen wie das Wasser dich die Membran diffundiert, was nicht sein dürfte da nur dampfdurchlässig.Schade. Ich hatte mir von der Goretex paclite Membran mehr erhofft."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,Superb!
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Zunächst war ich direkt nach dem Erhalt der Jacke etwas zwiegespalten: Zum einen ist sie erstklassig verarbeitet, macht insgesamt einen hochwertigen Eindruck und passt vor allem am Körper für mich (1,81 m, 86 kg) in der Größe L perfekt. Auch die Materialdicke ist für mich in Ordnung: nicht zu dünn aber auch keine LKW-Plane. Zum anderen fand ich die Ärmel etwas zu lang.Nach dem Kauf habe ich im hiesigen Handel noch einige Jacken von Mitbewerbern der Marke probiert und festgestellt, dass die meisten noch längere Ärmel haben bzw. am Körper nicht so gut passen. Nur wenige hatten Unterarmreißverschlüsse. Mittlerweile habe ich mich mit den etwas zu langen Ärmeln, es geht auch vielleicht um einen bis zwei Zentimeter, aber arrangiert, zumal die Bündchen mit den Klettverschlüssen so eingestellt werden können, dass sie nicht zu weit herunterrutschen.Ich habe die Jacke nun drei Wochen und inzwischen auch im Regen ausprobiert. Bei mir ist sie absolut dicht. Auch die Kapuze ist so geschnitten, dass sie gut vor der Nässe schützt, man aber nicht behindert wird. Die Dampfdurchlässigkeit konnte ich bei den derzeitigen Temperaturen noch nicht beurteilen, da die Jacke aber über eine Unterarmbelüftung verfügt, ist dieser Punkt für mich aber auch nicht so wichtig. Wind- und Wasserdicht ist sie allemal und mit geöffneten Achselreißverschlüssen ist sie auch bei etwas anstrengenderer Betätigung und schlechtem Wetter sicher gut geeignet.An dieser Stelle ein kurzer Einwurf meinerseits. In einigen Rezensionen ist die Meinung zu lesen, dass eine Funktionsjacke die Körperfeuchte auf jeden Fall abzutransportieren habe. Das kann die Membran aber nur, wenn ein deutlicher Unterschied bei Temperatur und Luftfeuchtigkeit zwischen innen und außen besteht, sprich es draußen trocken und kühl ist. Warum sollte die Feuchte durch den Stoff nach außen dringen, wenn dort die gleichen Bedingungen herrschen? Im tropischen Regenwald wird die Funktion zum Beispiel nicht gegeben sein Zaubern kann das Material auch nicht, es gelten die physikalischen Naturgesetze.Aber zurück zur Jacke: einen Aufhänger im Kragenbereich hätte ich, wie einige andere Rezensenten schrieben, auch gern gehabt. Allerdings ist die Jacke auch leicht genug, um sie an der Gummizugverstellung der Kapuze an einen Haken zu hängen, wenn man keinen Bügel zur Verfügung hat.Die Farbe ist sensationell (arktic navy), sie sieht hochwertig und sportlich aus, passt mit kleinen Einschränkungen bei der Ärmellänge prima und hat genau die Features, die es braucht. Auch dass sie kein zusätzliches innenfutter aus Meshgewebe hat gefällt mir ausgezeichnet. Für meinen Zweck die perfekte Jacke, deshalb fünf Sterne."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Esteticamente molto gradevole, i materiali sembrano robusti e le finiture risultano impeccabili, avendola pagata meno di 130,00 € mi sembra un'ottimo affare.Ad un primo test l'impermeabilità è totale, vedremo come si comporta sul campo.La vestibilità è abbondante, in inverno può essere indossato tranquillamente sopra un piumino.Ottime le tasche per le mani dotate anche di velcro oltre alla cerniera, comoda anche quella sul petto.la giacca non è ultraleggera, la vedo indicata per la mezza stagione o l'inverno con uno strato isolante sotto, per l'estate preferisco un antivento più leggero."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Il rapporto qualità/prezzo mi sembra molto buono per una giacca di gore-tex (pagata 118 €), la userò spt in bici, vedremo la tenuta sul campo nel tempo. Estetica piacevole e pulita, buone finiture, bel blu. Veste comodo, per me, 185 cm, 90 kg, va bene la L, posso indossare una giacca leggera imbottita sotto. Come da foto la lunghezza, secondo me, è comoda per andare in bici ma qualcuno potrebbe preferirla più lunga. Fatta in Vietnam."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Io ho usato il prodotto in montagna sotto la pioggia e mi ha riparato perfettamente. Avendola usata ancora solo d'estate non so dire quanto e se ripara anche dal vento e dal freddo ma credo che il prodotto sia stato pensato sopratutto come antipioggia da indossare quindi avendo sotto un altro indumento per le altre esigenze, tempo freddo, umido, etc."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Very satisfied with this jacket. I use it as the outer layer when I am cross-country skiing or snowshoeing. It’s breathable which is why I bought it. I usually wear a Large size and I bought a large. It left a bit of room for the layers I wear underneath it. This is the older model which has more features, that have since been removed."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Ich habe die Jacke erworben nachdem meine bisherige Jacke bei einem Regenschauer nicht richtig dicht war. Die erste Probe war nicht so schön, da die Jahre zwar dicht war sie dann aber von innen schweißnass war. Beim nächsten Mal trug ich dann einen langarmigen Pullover , da ging das besser. Atmungsaktiv ist wohl eine Auslegungssache.Badauerlich fand ich allein eine fehlende Innentasche, um zum Beispiel Briefe zu transportieren. Dafür waren die vorhanden  sonst recht großzügigen Außentaschen leider zu klein.  Auf jedenfall ist die Jacke dicht."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Ho preso la taglia s di questo marmot minimalist e nonostante il torace e le maniche siano ok, il busto è un tantino corto rispetto le altre misure. Aderisce perfettamente ma mi piaceva avere il busto più lungo per coprire meglio dall'acqua.Ho scelto il reso dell'articolo e di acquitare il salewa puez gtx taglia S perché è uguale di torace e quel poco più lungo di busto perché è perfetto per me.Consiglio a chi è indeciso sulla taglia di prendere un metro da sarta, misurare il torace, la vita e le maniche e verificare sulla tabella delle taglie dei siti ufficiali la taglia adatta."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Giacca molto morbida con una buona vestibilitá; il tessuto esterno non fa scivolare via le goccia di acqua sotto la pioggia e tende a rimanere bagnato.L’impermeabilità del capo NON  è in discussione.Ho spruzzato un prodotto specifico per questo tipo di capi per avere l’effetto desiderato sulle goccia di acqua e la situazione è decisamente migliorata.Comunque soddisfatto dell’acquisto ad un prezzo ottimo per un capo in Goretex.Servizio di consegna e reso Amazon impeccabili.Essendo io alto 1,85 avevo preso una XL ma era un po’ troppo larga per i miei gusti; la L è perfetta nonostante io sia abbastanza muscoloso."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,Giacca di buona qualità. Ripara molto bene dal vento e dalla pioggia. Ha cappuccio con piccola tesa che ripara gli occhiali in caso di pioggia Quando fa un po’ più caldo tende a far sudare. Puoi chiuderla in borsa o in valigia e quando la riprendi è comunque perfetta. Regalata a mio marito che aveva una giacca di marca simile (la fuma) ed è soddisfatto
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Hatte sie neulich am WE bei einer Ganztages Sportveranstaltung bei dauerregen an, hält, es kommt auch kein regen durch.aber die wirkliche stärke zeit sich ohnehin erst nach paar Waschdurchgängen, dann werden wir sehen ob es die 5 Sterne auch halten kann."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"È una vera porcheria. Impermeabilità fasulla, con una pioggerellina in 15 minuti mi sono inzuppato e mi ha distrutto uno smartphone per l'acqua che è entrata. La traspirabilità è più ridicola dell'impermeabilità, se non ti bagni per la pioggia ci pensa il sudore... State alla larga dai prodotti Goretex, oltre questa ne ho provate altre di marche diverse e ho capito che è diventato solo un riferimento commerciale senza alcun costrutto qualitativo diversamente di quello che era un tempo."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Molto leggero, cerniere YKK di alta qualità, molto utile le cerciere ascellari come anche la tasca anteriore. Il cappuccio è comodo, non cade sulla faccia quando si tira su anche se non si tirano le cordine, parte anteriore dello stesso rigida e dunque utile come visiera. Assolutamente impermeabile e anche antivento (per quanto ho potuto provare).L'unico ""difetto"" se si vuole guardare al pelo nell'uovo è il fatto che può ""scricchiolare"" un po' durante i movimenti. Io personalmente non lo considero un difetto perchè a me non crea problemi, ma so che alcuni lo trovano fastidioso. A questo prezzo difficile trovare di meglio."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Very impressed by this Marmot jacket, the workmanship and attention to detail is top notch.  The stitching is impeccable,  quality hardware and zippers, I'm hard pressed to find a single flaw.  I'm 6'4"", 240lb and the XL fit perfectly, not too tight around the torso, enough room for a warm long sleeve shirt underneath.  The sleeve length was also perfect (something that is always a problem with a 7' arm span), more of a European cut with longer arms and narrower waist.  The waist length could use another inch as pointed out but it certainly isn't a deal breaker.  The hood fit is amazing even with my big head and the fabric has a nice durable feel on the outside and not too sticky or clammy inside.  These are all my initial impressions, time will tell once I test it out in a rainstorm."
Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Marmot è una garanzia. Prodotto leggerissimo, impermeabile e caldo. Per le giornate invernali di Roma è più che sufficiente. Se si vuole utilizzare in inverno in montagna o in città del nord Italia ritengo che sia necessario indossare al di sotto un’imbottitura di “rinforzo”. Anche il cappuccio è imbottito e piacevolmente caldo, per nulla fastidioso. Calza molto grande. Normalmente indosso XL e a volte XXL, in questo caso ho dovuto  sostituire la XL con una “”L” !!!!!"

Marmot Men's Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,,0,"Ho comprato questa giacca pensando alla qualità del marchio.

The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Gets the job done.,5,"I recently moved to NY and this was the perfect jacket to keep me nice and dry. It is very lightweight, easy to pack, and keeps me pretty warm, too ( worn at around 55F / 12C). It is not a ""slim"" fit. It's definitely a comfort fit. I am 5'9"" of athletic body, sitting at 160lbs, (39""/ 99cm Chest) and the XS fit me just a little too big for my own liking, but it deserves the five stars, as it accomplishes what it is meant to do, and will allow you to layer underneath. It works real well against the wind; nothing gets through. There are zippers on the side on both armpits, and the hood has good coverage and allows me to wear my over-the-ear headphones(Sennheiser's HD 4.50)."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Tested in heavy rain by a ski patroller and ...,5,"Ski patrollers have to show up for their shifts, no matter what the weather. I've been looking for a rain gear solution for many years, using everything from Gloucester fisherman's duds to ponchos to plastic bags. After extensively reading reviews, I decided to buy The North Face Venture 2 Jacket and Rain Pants.Yesterday was the first chance that I had to put this combo together. I had a 9-hour shift in continuous rain (1.15"" during that period). Temps about 35degF.I donned the gear in the locker room and headed out to the lifts to start the day in downpour conditions. While water was beading up on the surface and shedding nicely, I wasn't sure if it was still seeping through. About 3 hours in, I went inside of the top house and took off the jacket and pants. My patrol parka, worn underneath, was only the slightest bit damp, and only at the outermost surface (warm and dry within). Same for the pants - my regular Gore-tex bibs were just a bit damp on the outer surface (they are old bibs and haven't had a DWR treatment in a long time). Anyway, 6 hours of rain later, and in the locker room at the end of the day, the gear underneath the Venture 2 jacket and pants were in the same condition - lightly damp on the surface and dry within. I could feel a light dampness to the interior of the Venture jacket and pants, but clearly they were not letting water through in any significant way. Note also that I had a backpack on all day and nothing came through where the straps wear against the jacket.  I don't think that the interior moisture came from inside (i.e., sweat condensate); I vented the gear.So, this system works. Note that I had my standard ski gear on underneath. If you are using this for rain protection in non-winter conditions, I would advise the use of an insulation layer as it does get a tad moist on the inner surface, and that would not be comfortable, say, with only a cotton tee shirt on or with just shorts. You're going to feel moisture and likely feel cold, but you won't get soaked. I'd say you could use these with jeans/hiking pants and a thin Merino summer top and do quite well in wet and warm conditions.YMMV, but this system worked for me in serious rain conditions.Sizing... 5'-9"" and 150# with full winter gear including a ski patrol parka ... size medium worked well."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,RUNS VERY LARGE!,4,"Fabric and quality was as expected but it runs SUPER large.  My husband is a tall, big man.  He had a North Face in a size XL that had worn out so we ordered this since he needed a new one quickly fior a trip.  He’d gained some weight and we’ve been buying size 2XL tees so we ordered size 2XL in this, even after reading other reviews that it ran large.  The awful thing is I almost ordered a 3XL, thinking *what if they actually don’t run large?* as he was visiting friends in PA and would be wearing layers.  When we received it, it was HUGE!  If there had been time to order another and return it, I’d have ordered a size XL which is smaller than his normal size.  ORDER A SIZE SMALLER!!!"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Disappointed,1,"I purchased this jacket after the great reviews, and like the other reviewers, it fits one size larger (which was great advice from the reviewers).However the quality of the jacket is less than expected. It repelled rain for the first 3 days of my hiking trip in Alaska (12 days total, 8 days of rain) but failed me after that.I’m fine being cold because the outside of the jacket is wet (but still being dry inside) versus being cold AND wet inside because the jacket is not stopping moisture. That is where I found myself after the first 3 days with this jacket.If you like a jacket that looks good but is not very weatherproof, this is the jacket for you. If you are serious about rain protection, I’d recommend something else."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,COMPACT/travel - Wash cold/hang dry. Standard fit. Layers over fleece to make fall/winter coat. Even use as summer rain coat,5,"This is my third such coat. If you wash it in cold water and hang to dry, it will last years. I like how this can combine with a fleece for a winter coat. I also like how it can be worn in the summer as a rain coat on a boat. It is the most versatile jacket ever. I never crush it, some do. I notice sitting on it a lot will damage the impermeable layer. I noticed this with a lazy colleague. However, I have crushed mine and compacted it for travel (rolling) with zero issues. This has a sturdy not soft and weird feel. That's a plus! It also packs well. Opt for this over any rain coat saying it compacts well for travel, especially considering it oddly seems to adjust it level or warmth to the weather. A trusted classic."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Excellent Rain coat for the price,5,"Material is light, but feels very durable and comfortable to wear. I'll have to update when it rains, but this jacket feels and looks very nice!Also, I saw some reviews that mention it doesn't come with a bag, I feel like Northface/Amazon probably didn't clarify properly but you roll the jacket up and pull it through the left pocket. There's a strap in your left pocket that says stow...hope this helps some of you looking for that functionality."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Waterproof; breathable; lightweight; packable,5,"Best raincoat I've worn so far. Layer it over fleece and it's good enough for most winter weather as well.I chose the Venture 2 over the more popular Resolve for the velcro-adjustable cuffs (vs elastic), armpit zips, and the inclusion of an inside pocket. The only tradeoff, wrt to the Resolve, is that the Venture's hood doesn't pack into the collar.My more-perfect raincoat would combine the velcro-cuffs and pitzips of the Venture2, with the packable hood of the Resolve."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"Got a Medium, I'm 5'9"" 160lbs and stockyish. ...",4,"Got a Medium, I'm 5'9"" 160lbs and stockyish. Medium in most things but this is a bit big, sleeves a bit long too."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Durable and bomb-proof,5,"This jacket is great. We've had nothing but torrential downpours here in MI the past few weeks and it has kept me dry. I love it's lightweight feel, breathability, and durability. The pit zips on each side do good to help it breathe more."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Great jacket for under $100!,5,"Great jacket for under $100! High quality material. Fits as expected. The relaxed fit isn't snug, but feels good and allows for extra layers, which is perfect for colder climates. Not insulated, but works well for a shell. The hood fits very well. The drawstring allows you to tighten the waistline. Also has armpit vents. I'm 5'8 170 and the medium fits well. After testing against the elements I will update. Would highly recommend this jacket!"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"Runs Big, Interior lining color not correct as pictured on Amazons site",4,I ordered the Tnf Dark Grey Heather jacket in Size Large. I am 6ft 175lbs and this is slightly big on me and definitely long in the arm length. It fits loose so you can wear other clothing such as a sweater underneath for warmth. As other have mentioned this is not a jacket to keep you warm rather it is to keep you dry and protect you from the wind chill. I can say that I was a little disappointed with the color I chose Tnf Dark Grey Heather because the picture on Amazon shows the Tnf Dark Grey Heather lining as Dark Grey/Black but when I received mine the interior lining is bright white. I actually chose this one because of the comments someone else made about the TNF Black having a bright white interior. Anyways the interior color is a minor thing but Amazon should update the picture to represent what was actually being purchased. I have not used it yet but supposed to get some rain in the coming days so we will see how it works and I will update this review. One thing to note is that when I tried it on I noticed it is very stiff and noisy but I figure it just needs to be worn and loosed up.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Who does the sizing?,4,"Although I sometimes wear a large, I originally ordered this in a medium, based on reviews.  I had to return the medium for a small, which is okay through the chest but the arms are still too long.  I'm keeping it because I like the jacket in most other respects and the velcro tabbed sleeves make it wearable."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Great for stopping the wind.,5,"Very weatherproof, also good to block the wind. Used this while I was in Texas in very cold weather and with layering underneath it performed very well. Also used in Southern California without the layering and it was cool to wear and comfortable. I would recommend this rain jacket."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Great Rain Jacket for,5,"I live in Oregon where we get a few days of rain, OK more like many days.  This is my first North Face Jacket I've owned.  I try to avoid buying clothing based on trendy.  Rather I want something that does look good but overall will do its job.  So far so good.  Rain is no match for this jacket.  Not Sure how it will do in major down pours, we don't get many of those, or hours on end of rain.  But for the light steady rain of the Northwest this jacket is great.  It doesn't keep out the cold, but is light enough to layer up underneath.  The hood is great.  Zipper perfect.  I like the cuff Velcro which helps change the size of the cuffs.  The slate gray color is sharp and looks good.  Overall great jacket for  moderate temps and weather of the rainy Northwest, so you never will use an Umbrella!"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Check the Sizing,5,"Looking for a lightweight, water proof rain jacket to wear on drizzly days. Also, wanted it to have pockets, a hood, and have some style to it. This jacket met my requirements perfectly.I'm 6'4, 200 lbs, 42 inch chest and a M fit me snuggly in a ""slim fit"" kind of way, which is what I wanted. Typically I wear a L in most tops so was taking a risk getting a M. The length of the sleeves and torso also looks great.  If you want a little more room in the chest you'll have to go up a size, however as I didn't try on the large I can't say how it will fit."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,making it a great outer shell,5,"The jacket is very thin and a bit baggy, making it a great outer shell. It blocks wind and water great. You'll want to wear some insulating layer like a fleece jacket or something underneath it--this jacket by itself will not keep you warm.I got the small and I think it's a little baggy for me, 5'11 male. It's quite nice that way, as I can easily fit it over anything I'm wearing, but just keep this in mind in case you were looking for something more form-fitting and not baggy/flowy."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Great rain jacket,5,"Husband is 6’3”, 200lbs, slim build, has an XL. Loves this jacket. Says it doesn’t make him feel swampy when it’s gets humid after the rain it was protecting him from.  He has a long torso so this hits him slightly higher than someone who is 6’ or less.  The North Face really nailed this one!"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Don't buy,1,"I am not recommending this jacket to anyone. First it is way too big. I normally order XL size so that I can wear over my regular uniform but this one is just way too big. But first and foremost why I am not recommending this, is because of the material of the jacket. It is like a Tyvek material (similar to the white protective coveralls or the FEDEx white envelopes). It is very cheap material. I would imagine that this jacket would make a lot of noise when you're walking as the material would rub against each other. I returned my order for a refund. Avoid this Venture 2 jacket."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"Best stuffable rain poncho I've ever owned, by far",4,"I bought this because my previous stuffable rain poncho started to get sticky and gross, presumably due to some kind of decomposition of the waterproofing treatment, or maybe the underlying fabric? It's way too early to tell if there will be deterioration with age, but so far it's much superior to my earlier poncho. For one thing, I like that it stuffs into one of its pockets instead of demanding that you keep track of, and not accidentally lose, a separate stuffing bag. For another, it's less wrinkly and looks more like a regular jacket when you wear it, instead of something you just unpacked from years of being crammed into a tiny bag. The only problem I have with it is that it isn't as easily attached to one of my belt loops on hikes where I MIGHT need it but don't need to wear it at the start of the hike. My previous rain ponchos easily and unobtrusively attached to a belt loop because they had two cord ends on the (inconvenient) bag that could be tied to a loop with a simple bow knot and strongly resist coming undone and dropping off in the wilderness, never to be seen again, in a 10-20-mile hike."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Florida fishing  great bad weather jacket,5,"Great jacket, the pouch thats shown in the picture is the left jacket pocket. Folds into that. Youtube video showing how. See complaints on how there no pouch , there is.Very nice i end up in the rain to much this jacket keeps me dry and warm in S. Fl  relizing its not real cold here I dont know how warm it keeps you in the cold, great here. Plus never been in the rain more than a few hours. Not sure how long it will keep you dry. But it is great for what i use it for keep it in over size tackle box. Pull it out for when im traveling.  Perfect for that. Not sure what its made from felt different from other jackets ive own . But i love it and will keep getting them when i wear out this one. Im hard on jackets"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Great jacket at an awesome price!,5,"I love this jacket! Seams and construction are high quality (as you'd expect from anything North Face), and the fit is very comfortable.  There is a trend to sell everything form fitting these days, which makes it hard to wear a sweater underneath.  This jacket is not like that - it is comfortably sized, so I over did it by buying a 2XL - would easily have fit an XL (48"" chest - 5'10). With COVID going on, I won't bother exchanging....So the jacket is a little big, but still looks good.  Has arm pit vents, and 2x zippered outside pockets form 2x useable deep inner jacket pockets.  Inner coating (no sewn in liner) helps cut wind and water, without feeling rubbery.  I'm super happy with this purchase!"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Big fan of all North Face Jackets,5,"I have bought so many Northface lightweight jackets. I'm 5' 9.5"" and the small always fits me perfectly. I bought this specifically for a vacation to Singapore because it is always raining and 80+ degrees there and it was a great choice. It was very lightweight and had ventilation zips."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"Great jacket, great value",5,"I bought a TNF Venture jacket in early 2000s. I wore that jacket into the ground, from everyday day use to day hikes to backpacking for over a decade. I no longer have that jacket. A jacket like this comes in handy for lots of weather occasions and I didn't have one anymore. So I went straight to TNF looking for the Venture. I am 6'4"" at 230lbs and the XL fits great and feels right; just like the jacket I remember. I really like the new color (Urban Navy Heather). I am a dyed in the wool The North Face fan. I hope this jacket holds up and lasts like the last one. Very happy with my purchase."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"Basic, basic windcheater",3,"Basic ripstop windcheater that everybody makes. It's actually the exact same product as the Eddie Bauer Cloud Cap jacket (with the exact same MSRP). The photo's make it look like one of the nicer TNF jackets. Probably best for a sudden downpour on a summers day, or wearing over a sweater at the beach in the spring/fall."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,I'm wearing a potao chip bag,3,"I've several high end gortex outer shells.  I use this for casual, travel use.  Needless to say is gets bunched up and wadded and tosed wet into a pouch.  And it doesn't complain.  it still works.  Mind you it does need maintenance like any water proof piece of gear.  Keep it clean and once in a while spray it with Kiwi Protect-All Waterproofer.This is my third jacket like this.  It wears well except along the neckline, where the waterproof lining gets the worst wear.For the price, the weight and protection this garment offers,  I think a good poncho might work better but those are less fashionable and hard to wear in an airport.  Even with a cowboy hat."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"Great product, but it runs very small!",5,"Buy one size larger!!Bought it a Medium size to use is as a rain cover in hikes and as a daily use windshield.This is my second The North Face rain cover (two different models), and both are M size, but my previous one fitter like a Large (which is good, if you are planning to use it on top of bulky jackets in the backcountry).This one, however, runs bellow the average size for a Medium, probably what can be considered a Small.I can still wear it, but is at that point where my movements are a little bit restrained, and that might not be ideal if you are planning to put in a lot of use on that.Other than that, the features are great! Slick design, great construction, Gore-tex all around and super stylish! Just couldn't manage to do that trick where you fold it inside the pocket, and wouldn't recommend it too, because that can cause some wearing of the Gore-tex lining"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Great Lightweight Rain Jacket,5,"I have purchased many cheap rain jackets over the years which work okay for light rain/mist or if you are running to and from the car where you aren't in the rain for very long. They do no work for being in the rain for a long time such as backpacking. I finally bit the bullet and got a more expensive jacket and i couldn't be happier! this jacket can handle the rain for my long hiking trips where i am in the rain for hours at a time. Plus the gray color looks really nice as well. Fits a little loose, but that won't be the case if i wear a sweater or multiple layers underneath so overall i'm quite happy with my purchase!"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Well designed and waterproof,5,I bought a couple of different jackets before this but they had odd sizing issues with the hood or arm length. This one is what I was hoping for. It folds up into its pocket so is very easy to pack. It is light. It is waterproof. The cuffs have a Velcro adjustment. The hood has sizing adjustments for the opening and back so it doesn’t flop around in the wind. I bought an XL but went up to XXL. I’m 6 ft and 235lbs.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Just get it.,5,"It's lightweight, and looks great. It's also waterproof, and I think the outer layer is hydrophobic. Water just beads off. It is the absolute perfect rain jacket. I've never owned a rain jacket this awesome."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Just Another Raincoat,3,"All raincoats look the same. I bought this one because it looked like more of a slim fit than its' Columbia counterpart, but really, they're all baggy. Don't tell me they're designed to be your 4th layer. That's bulls###. If I want baggy clothes, I'll buy a size larger. The sleeves are also REALLY long.I am 5'5"" 140lbs and bought the X-small. It works well for its designed purpose, but I still hate it."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"Great Jacket, get right size!",5,"Thanks to those who left a review about the sizing.  I'm 6ft./160lbs, and would typically buy a medium.  After reading the reviews about buying down a size, I decided to go with a small.  I'm glad I did, because the small was perfect.  I don't like a lot of room in my jackets and the arms were perfect in length.  One thing, the inside of the jacket was white, not black.  No big deal to me but if it matters to you, there you go."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,This is the perfect rain jacket,5,"I typically wear a women's XL, but I bought a men's XXL. I like to be able to wear a sweatshirt or layers underneath because most of my rain jacket usage happens at soccer games. I love the adjustable hood and the zippers underneath the arms. The jacket doesn't stick to me and it is extremely lightweight."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Worth every penny. Awesome coat!,5,I wish I could give MORE stars!!! This jacket is awesome. Bought for our son who works on a golf course and he LOVES it!!! He said he doesn’t get wet at all when it rains. It breathes well (also has zip pits).  Quality is great. Looks great as well. We ordered a couple colors and they’re all really nice. North face makes a great product. I’d buy again in a second. You won’t be disappointed. Worth every penny!!!
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Now even North Face makes crap. I would love to send it back and ...,1,"Typical current apparel manufacturing standards. Tiny zipper jammed this morning on the inside pocket liner and  after struggling to unjam it I had to rip the cloth free, shredding the wimpy zipper.  Now even North Face makes crap. I would love to send it back and force them to throw it in their trash can, but I guess I'll just have to throw it in mine.  On the upside I have an 15 year old Columbia raincoat that still functions great except the seams have begun to leak. Maybe I should just get the seams resealed if possible."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,my husband is 5 feet 10 inches tall weighing at ...,4,"my husband is 5 feet 10 inches tall weighing at 180lbs. It fits him perfectly and he really likes it. Its definitely more of a rain coat and for weather that is possibly 60 degrees  but maybe not for colder weathers on its own unless you add layers. It does have an unusual zip under the pits for when you do get hot but I just found that odd. When we actually put it to use, I will update on what it can and can't withstand."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Well-constructed but cheap zipper failed after a few months.,2,"**Update: After 2 - 3 months, the zipper no longer holds together at the bottom of the jacket. Seriously, North Face? I thought you were a high-quality brand, but you are using cheapo components in your jackets. I am lowering my review from three to two stars. DO NOT RECOMMEND.**This jacket has a solid, substantial feel (and is a good value). The sizing is generous which is fine for me, since I am a bike commuter and wear it over a down puffer coat. However, the hood is inadequate. It just sits on top of my head and does not extend to protect my face from the rain. I am totally puzzled why they would make the product this way--perhaps because it looks better? When I'm riding in a rain storm, I don't care about how the hood looks, I just want it to work well! I will keep the jacket and live with it, but when it is done (I hope it will last a couple of years) I will look for a new model."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,NFG,1,"This jacket does not breath at all.  Just buy vinyl.  Today, was very springlike, and glorious.  The I was quite comfortable with my inner layer of polar fleece, but when I took off the jacket, I discovered gallons of water and condensed between layers.  I was dripping and would soon be COLD!  I took off the jacket, and relinquished it, forever to the Kay-Wrap-Heep"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Great rain jacket!  Perfect fit!,5,"This is my third jacket.  The two I have prior to buying this one were the first series Venture jacket. Nothing wrong with them at all, just like having a couple of different color choices. I’ve had the other two for about a year and a half and they still do a great job at repelling water.  As far as the size, I’m 5’8 and 160 pounds and bought a large.  The fit is great for me.  I do like them a little baggy because I will often wear them over another jacket to block the wind.  They do a great job of that.I would highly recommend this jacket."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Love it,3,"Love the jacket very affordable, the only down side is the hood it dose not get tight enough that’s the only negative thing I would have to say."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"This was my second North Face rain shell, and I’m in construction.",5,"I like the overall design of the jacket. I prefer the Velcro wrist straps. It works excellent in the rain and wind stopper. I work in construction every day and when I’m out in the weather rain, sleet, snow or wind this is my go too gear. I also manage a family cattle ranch and this jacket has proven to be toughest rain shell I’ve ever owned. I’ve been extremely happy with this jacket for the price!"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Thank you for making a tall!,5,Excellent tall rain jacket with pit zips.  I'm 6'2 220lbs.  I get that a lot of outdoors types are smaller guys and that the current style seems to be to wear clothes that are too small but am thankful northface made a jacket for taller people that doesn't fit like an award hand me down jacket......I had enough of those as a kid.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,A lot looser than I expected,4,"Great jacket and quality, but it is a little larger than I was hoping. Usually I like my clothing to be more on the close-fitting, tailored side of things. This fits quite loose in the chest area, even though I was worried it would be too small with a medium (6 feet. 180lbs). I assume this is because this jacket is intended as a layer to wear over another jacket. If you are looking for a jacket with some substance or any insulation whatsoever, this is not the jacket for you. It is strictly a waterproof layer, very thin. I just wear it with a hoodie or jacket underneath."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Perfect for rain!,5,"I bought this to take on my trip to rainy Ireland, and it did a great job. It was a little warmer than normal in Ireland when I went, and this jacket did a good job of allowing me to stay somewhat cool, while still keeping me dry. There are zippers under the arm pit area that allow you to have a breeze come through the jacket without getting you wet, which was great. I was dry and happy the whole trip, and when not in use, I was able to fold this up into a tiny pocket on my backpack. Perfect!"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,This is an excellent product!,5,I bought these for two of my children for Christmas. Got a text from them stating that they LOVE LOVE LOVE them. That's a good as any product can possibly be...
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Nice but runs large,5,"Nice jacket, just runs large. I wear a medium in everything. Had to return this for a small. I'm 5'7"" and 155 lbs. The small fits perfectly. Rain beads right up on this jacket, and thankfully I don't get all sweaty inside. Recommended."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,good value,4,I am a career climber and mountaineer and have owned a variety of foul weather garments. For a lightweight shell this thing does the trick. Understand it is strictly a wind and rain shell to be worn over a sweater or jacket and will provide little warmth on its own. But for under $100 its a great deal
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Excellent Overall,5,"I like the feel of the jacket, not like a typical finish on a rain jacket. I appreciate the velcro sleeves and the pit zips for ventilation. The hood is adjustable but does not quite fit my head the way most hoods do--but this one aspect does not eclipse how good a value this jacket is."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"Great value, looks and feels great.",5,I bought this for my wife.  She loves the jacket and its regular fit.  It allows her to layer underneath this jacket.  It is lightweight and sheds rain.  The sleeves are slightly long but with the Velcro tabs it fits fine.  I personally have the Venture 1 and it still looks great after more than 4 years.  This jacket has great value for the amount paid for.  North face is also a remarkable company that honors their rain coats with a limited lifetime warranty.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Really thin and crunchy!,2,"I liked the color, but that’s about all I liked about it. The material was crunchy/loud to wear and it was very stiff, too. I couldn’t stand to have it on long. It was returned. I think if you could get past the texture and loud sound of this jacket, it might be good to keep rain out."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,My favorite rain jacket on the go; lightweight.,5,"I had a black medium before which I liked a lot. This one is even better. The lettering is embroidered. The jacket is lightweight and perfect for rainy weather. It comes with a hood and you can make adjustments to the waist, neck, and wrists. A little loose on me, but that’s alright."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Perfect and stylish...,5,"Got this for the hubby for Christmas. Wanted something with some weather proofing, that wasn't a solid colour, but also wasn't too bright and could be worn as layers or on it's own...this seemed like the perfect choice and he loved it!"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,zippers under arms = Comfort,5,I I have purchased  two Venture 2 Jackets.  The zippers under the arms are the best for warm rainy days.  They allow you to keep your jacket on without getting too warm.  The heather colors  are stylish and  offer a greater  compatibility in coordinating color choices.  The grey heather and navy heather will go with just about anything I wear.  very pleased with my purchases.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,relaxed fit so don't size up,5,"crinkly waterproof, comfy the navy is cool and dark shade of blue I really love it. Not too hot and good for layering.."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"Quality, well made.",5,"Needed it for overseas trip with rain expected while touring, Prime two day shipping rocks.  Nice sturdy jacket, waterproof and wind proof. Best part is it stores in its own pocket, great for packing.  It did run big for the size, but it works out since you can wear layers underneath."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Works!,5,Great extra layer for the motorcycle in pleasant weather. Zip underarms prevent the ballooning problem I had with another brand. Stows inside one of its pockets which makes it convenient to stash in my workout daypack. Velcro wrist ties tighten down to any size wrist. I normally wear an XL. Large was perfect for outer wear for a shirt or sweat. Only drawback is no tiedown for the hood. I addded a snap to take care of that.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Expensive but nice,5,"Great quality, but pretty expensive. Only complaints are that I wish the logo was white instead of grey and that I wish it was a little more lightweight. Fairly lightweight already though. Great rain jacket."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Great quality,5,"Great quality jacket. Grey color is slightly darker than images, which is preferable.  The jackets has a generous fit allowing for layering if needed.Have not used it on a rainy day yet; however, I am confident it will do its job.  Will update the review if needed."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Fit is larger than size,2,"Bought this for my son who wears a medium in everything and it was too large on him. The sleeves were too long and the fit overall too big. Recommend you consider ordering a smaller size. Although the jacket seemed to be quality-made, I can't really say since he did not use it. Also, the white lining on the inside was not very appealing imo."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"A Really nice, lightweight, rain and wind jacket.",5,"Wanted this for just a lightweight jacket in the rain or wind on cool and breezy days when walking. Works very nicely.It is simply a quality nylon type jacket with a hood that does the job. Don't expect the breathability of vortex or anything like that, but definitely a keeper. I have used it walking, fishing, at football games. For a lightweight, moderate climate jacket it is a keeper."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Great rainjacket for non-cold weather,5,"This is a great jacket for rain year-round. I usually buy my jackets a size up however, so that in cold weather I can wear something underneath this shell. Great overall jacket, and it's really nice that it's packable into one of the pockets. That makes it easy to throw in a backpack or suitcase. I've had many north face products and have yet to have one fall apart on me. And even if they did, they would probably fix or replace it due to their warranties."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Nice design,5,"I dig the design of this Jacket. Looks very modern. The material is rather thin, so I cannot rely it too much in cold temperatures, but it works well in cool temperatures and repells water as it should. The heat isolation is great, when I run with it on, I get very hot and sweaty in a 1 or 2 miles.  You can’t go way to get it."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Arm Length is way over provisioned,2,The arm length is stupid long. I have worn many other north face jackets of the same size (Large) that fit me perfectly. This one fits my torso but the arms go way past my fingertips. Would not return for medium due to worry that it will be too tight around my chest.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Noisy,1,It was noisy so doesn't matter about the rest. Terrible fabric!!!
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Huge,3,"Im 6'3"" 175 lbs.  Ordererd the large.  ENORMOUS.  My br in law is about 6'5"" 200+ and was still big on him.  Not sure if this was a one off or what but had to return it which was super simple.  Dropped off at ups store and $ was back in my account next day.  Wasnt too impressed with the jacket itself either.  I understand its a simple rain jacket but for $100 i was a little disappointed."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"Duh, its TNF.  Of course it's good.",5,"It TNF.  What do u expect?  That's right, good quality at a fair price.  Why bother with anything else.I have 2 of these.  One for the truck and one in my RV.  Bought each of my kids one as well.  Gave one to the EX for Xmas"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Awesome Jacket,5,"My husband usually wears a large, bought a large and it fit great!  Wore the jacket on our Alaskan Cruise and it was perfect!  Kept his sweatshirt dry and he didn't get too hot with it on!"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Still A Great Jacket,5,This is well made and was purchased to replace one I bought 25 years ago.  Still as good as ever. Plenty of room for layers underneath.  This does have a bit of room which is what I wanted.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,LOVE IT Great outer shell to any layer not waterproof,5,Love it. I have a lot of TNF everything and I have a heavy half zip sweatshirt type but thick and this was perfect for using this as the outer shell to the pullover. Great price
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Un poco decepcionado,2,"Compré esta jacket hace un tiempo, cumplió con la expectativa, pero al tiempo, el forro interno se empezó a romper con mucha facilidad, se suavizó y cuando me ponía la jacket, los brazos me quedaban llenos de pedazos del forro.  Ya no la puedo utilizar, aunque por fuera se ve bien todavía.  Estoy pensando comprar otra similar, pero no de esta misma marca."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Great addition to the day-hike backpack,5,"Ability to roll/fit in a small pack, unzippable vents under the arms are a super awesome addition and helped to stay cooler while hiking, but staying dry in the rain."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Perfect,5,Man I was shocked this jacket was this cheap. Feels amazing. Perfect size. Never buying full price again. Do not miss out on this. Bought 6 months ago and still no issue!
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Runs larger than expected,3,"I ordered a medium and it looks like a large. Normally I wear medium jackets just fine, but this was too big. I have average sized length arms and the sleeves went over my entire hands. Quality is good overall.Order 1 size down."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Good but not perfect.,3,"It's compact and light and airy. I like the adjustable Velcro wrist and the large pit vents.I dislike the hood. The design could use a larger laminated front flap as well as an adjustable up/down Velcro strap on back to lift hood above eyes. The neck is a bit too roomy considering this is a light jacket, wish it was a bit more snug.Also, they could add additional pocket on the chest."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Strictly a Shell,4,"Purchase this with the anticipation that you'll only need to wear it when there's a light rain. It's a shell, plain and simple. No real frills about it, but be weary that if it's a warmer rainy day, you're going to sweat underneath because this thing traps the heat."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Works well in the rain and it was pouring when I wore it. I feel a little ritzy in it and worry about people stealing it.,4,A good quality rain proof jacket. Nice color. Yes expensive but does work. A little on the noisy side too.I wore it so far once in the rain. However every time I wear this stuff I have to feel like someone will take it on me. Someone took my two tone blk grey bionic 1 jacket. This stuff works but attracts people's eyes to it.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Light but rugged jacket,5,"North Face had excellent design features.  I bought this jacket for frequent rain showers in the Pacific Northwest, yet it is light weight for spring and summer weather...Note that North Face branded products (if covered by warranty) fails due to a manufacturing defect they will repair it without charge, or replace it, at their discretion."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Had to replace my old one after 10 years,5,This lightweight rain jacket is perfect for my trips to Costa Rica. I bought it for our April trip which we are not taking as CR is closed to tourism during Covid 19. Damn. I have worn the previous one during torrential rainy season rain and never got wet.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Fits as expected,5,"Nice Value for the price, heading to Canada for fishing and feel confident it will keep me dry..."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Too thin and no free returns,1,"The jacket is too thin. I bought it to be an outer shell but it wouldn't have worked. Looked really flimsy as well.Also, didn't realize but the vendor charges shipping fees on returns."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Nice waterproof jacket,5,Jacket performs well under heavy rain in Costa Rica.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,great product,4,great product perfect for the raining season and rain forest...... size S almost perfect fit but a quick big
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Good Jacket Big Hood,4,Just got mine and it's a very nice jacket. Sized slightly large but that's a good thing if you plan to layer underneath. My only complaint is the oversized hood doesn't cinch well and covers my eyes without a hat or helmet under.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Returned,4,True to size returned it.  After looking at the material and reviews I was not sure how water proof it would have been.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Stinks,1,"As soon as I opened it smelled like gasoline. Hung it outside for 2 days then washed it and wore it to the park and I could still smell the gasoline odor although not nearly as bad as the first day. It’s a basic windbreaker, thin and in my opinion not worth the price nor the reputation of the north face"
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Packable Pocket,5,"You can tell this is a very well made jacket. Also it is nice that you can pack this jacket into the outside left pocket, just turn the pocket inside out and tuck it in then zip it up."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"Great waterproof jacket, plus convenience of storing it away in a pocket.",5,"It's great how waterproof this is, looks good, and the convenience of storing itself in a pocket it's a plus. I used it in pouring rain and kept me dry, at least the upper part of myself.  Planning on buying one for my girlfriend."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,By Far the Best Rain Jacket North Face Makes,5,This rain jacket is incredible. Keeps you dry and stays ventilated. Perfect for thick Georgia rainstorms!!
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Good but not as water resistant as I wanted.,3,I like this rain jacket but it is not as water resistant as I was hoping. While the hood and the core of the jacket work fine the arms seems to let small amounts of water through. I work outside a lot and after just a little while in the rain I can feel my arms getting damp underneath. I've had worse rain coats in the past but for the money I paid I was hoping for better.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Great jacket in red and black.,5,Love this jacket for rain or snow.  Especially love logo monogram in it instead of the fired on type of letters
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Real thin... Use as outer layer,5,Real thin... Have North face mid layer so I was still warm... Rain proof and wind proof... Compliments on it...
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Great coat,4,"This is a great jacket that keeps you dry in a monsoon.  The sizing runs large, however, so if you are not planning on buying to layer up then I would consider buying small.  The pit zips are great."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Waaaay too small,3,I have an existing jacket from Northface that’s the same size and it fits. This DOES NOT.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Good Summer Jacket,5,Good summer rain jacket. As a freelance/fineart photographer having a rain jacket(especially for the downpour days) is key. I love the hand pockets and the hood is tops. Would also work well as an outer layer come fall. North Face always knocks it out of the park!
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,NOT WATERPROOF!!!,1,"Not even water resistant. My be a fake, but every time I take the jacket off my shirt underneath is wet."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Worth it.,5,Great quality as always. Little too large I'm 6 foot 2 and about 190 it's slightly baggy but ok.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"Great, lightweight rain jacket",5,This is a great rain jacket that is lightweight and stuffs easily into the hood.

The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Water resistant and looks good,5,I purchased this jacket for my son and he wears it everywhere.  It looks good and keeps him dry. I'm not sure how warm it is because he's the kid who wears shorts in a blizzard.  It took about a week of continuous wear to get the fold line that fell across his stomach to go away. I only mention this because at first we thought the jacket was too big due to the weird bulge.
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Perfect to throw in backpack for day at Disney when T-storms are in the area!,5,"packs easily into pocket, small and tight.  easily stows into a backpack without taking up too much space.  was able to pull it out when an afternoon thunderstorm popped up while walking through parks at Disney...this wonderful thing save me from having to lug around an umbrella, I stayed nice and dry, and when the rain lifted it stuffed right back into its pocket."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Great rain jacket!,5,"Nice rain jacket!

The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Weird fit,3,"I like North Face if I can get something that fits right.

The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Nice light raincoat.,5,"This is the perfect rain coat/windbreaker.

The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"Good, inexpensive rain jacket to keep in daypack and Jeep",5,Not a lot of bells and whistles but you don't need that for a rain jacket.

Mine was made of a slightly different material and after 3 uses it now soaks up water in the arms, especially around the hands.  It also ripped on the inside pocket, which may have been there before I even touched it.  I recommend saving your money and buying this or another brand elsewhere."
The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Waaaaay too big!!!!,2,Don’t like the fit at all. It’s like wearing a garbage bag. I always take a medium in North Face and this fits like an XL. I never wear it it’s so big it’s uncomfortable and annoying. I’m 5’10” 160 lbs

The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Too big,2,Should have looked at reviews more carefully.  I am a size medium.  When I tried it on the arms are long with sleeves reaching fingertips and overall for a light jacket way too large.  Maybe small would have been better.  Returning to Amazon.

The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Love it!,5,"Love this jacket - it arrived quickly and was as described.  Color is perfect.  The fit is just about right - may run a bit big, but will work well with a sweatshirt under.

The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,I usually wear a Small in North Face jackets and ...,4,I usually wear a Small in North Face jackets and ordered a size down (XS) based on reviews.

In heavy winds the hood will loosen and come off my head.

The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,Awesome jacket!!,5,"Purchased as a gift for my husband, and he loves it 😊! Very sturdy material on the inside of the jacket. Which he likes alot better than the mesh that comes on other north faces. Fit him perfectly. I orderd the Heather gray wanted to get a darker color since he usually only has black jackets, and it is a awesome color(just like the picture). Tested out the waterproof material when we went snow mobiling in AK for the week, and he stayed more dry than I did in my snowboard jacket. Also kept him very warm in the 17° weather with of course something under it 😉. Very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend!!"

The North Face Men’s Venture 2 Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket,"comfortable, warm and waterproof",5,"This is my second Venture 2 jacket.  I  was wearing the first one 2 years ago while walking in my town, and I was hit by a pickup truck that didn't see me - throwing me 20 feet.  The jacket wasn't harmed at all (I wasn't so lucky).  Sadly, I lost the jacket early this year, so immediately bought another one.  Light, durable, comfortable, warm and waterproof!  Oh, and large pockets!"
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Armed and Faulty,1,"With great expectations I awaited the arrival of this jacket. Upon opening the package came the initial excitement. Overall, I was absolutely thrilled with what I was seeing until further examination. I slipped into the jacket and, it was very comfortable. It fit below the waistline which was a very good thing for wearing a side holster. In that, it concealed very well. What I found extremely alarming and dangerous were the built-in inside pockets and, the accompanying holster. I was deeply disappointed with the velcro strips and, that the neither pockets were finished. The holster was cheaply made and very weak. It was part of a velcro system and, did not cling very well at all. It pulled away from the velcro and, fell all the way to the bottom hem at the waist. This presents a most dangerous situation on a couple of levels. First, in the event you needed to draw your weapon, you would have to reach all the way down to the bottom of the jacket. This is a most dangerous situation when minutes can cost you your life. Secondly, the ""accidental"" discharge of the weapon when trying to retrieve it.My strong suggestion is to not buy this terribly put together garment and, for there to be a massive recall of this jacket with full refunds. If your success with this jacket is favorable, it won't be for long. I returned mine and, will not pursue another one. I have asked for a refund and, will receive it. I cannot, in good faith or conscience, recommend buying this item."
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Well made lined denim jacket,5,"I do not want to fault this jacket.  It has no shortcomings that I have found.  It is just not what I was hoping for.I do not care about the concealed carry feature.  I wanted a lined denim jacket and they are hard to find in tall sizes.  I was hoping that I would still be able to use the inside pockets to drop in a wallet or checkbook.  That is not practical with this jacket since the inside pockets have no bottoms.  Anything placed into them other than possible a firearm would have to be retrieved from behind the lining at the bottom.A firearm would apparently attach to the inside plastic strips that are sort of like Velcro.  This would attach with an accessories that is included with the jacket.  The downside to this is that the plastic strips are very noisy with about every movement.The denim used to make the jacket that I got is the type of denim that looks to me like the imported imitation of American denim.  It is not a denim look match with jeans and other clothing.  It does not look like the denim pictured on the online catalog.  The collar is corduroy, the jacket is well made and the fit for me is correct for an XL Tall.I use to carry a concealed weapon when I was a police officer.  If I were to carry a concealed weapon again this is not the way that I would do it.  I would stay with the high rise belt holster.  I will however keep the jacket since it is comfortable and well made."
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Dissatisfied with CCW pocket.,4,"It looks nice, fits nice. But if you got it for the main purpose if conceal carry...I’m a little dissatisfied with it. It comes with a universal holster (which is nice) but it attaches to Velcro on the inside pockets. So if you attach it on the inside of the pocket it holds my compact SA:XD9, but it becomes super bulky and just looks ugly. It looks better if I let the gun drop to the bottom of the pocket, but in an emergency it’ll take a longer to withdraw my firearm. The inside of the jacket is thin, it feels too thin actually, I feel like it’ll tear up quick, unfortunately I still haven’t worn it out in public because of the heat. It’s summer and our weather has been in the triple digits. So I will be updating later on to see how it lasted.For now my only problem is the CCW pocket, when carrying conceal it is WAY TOO bulky;And my only concern is that the inside material may be too thin and might not last long.But it is Wrangler material and I’m going to give it the benefit of the doubt. Overall when I don’t have my firearm concealed it looks nice and fits nice. Length of jacket is ever so slightly under my belt. It’s perfect."
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Not a good choice. Very poor design!,2,"First off, Wrangler calls this a saddle blanket lined jacket. It is not. It has a very thin layer of flannel. They used to make an actual saddle blanket lined denim jacket. Apparently not anymore. If someone knows where to find one, give me a holler!  Second, and the reason I almost sent it back, is it has a so called concealed carry pocket and holster inside. This is the worst design ever. The holster is a complete joke. Seriously. Worse still is how it attaches inside the jacket. Imagine the scratchy plastic side of Velcro completely lining the inside wall of the denim layer. That’s what they did here. Apparently the so called holster here is supposed to stick up against this hard plastic sheet and that’s what holds the soft extremely flimsy thing they are trying to pass off as a holster. But the worst part of this whole design is how much of the plastic Velcro is in the jacket. Both the left and right side of the front of the jacket is covered with this stuff. It’s not something you see of course because it’s in between the denim on the outside and the thin flannel on the inside, but it’s something you can actually hear. I wish I could explain this better. It really requires a video to fully understand what is going on here. The jacket is lined with a brittle feeling layer of plastic. Any time you move or bend over, you actually hear the plastic bending over. It’s loud and uncomfortable. It’s very restrictive in movement also.  Another thing is the flannel lining actually sticks to the Velcro plastic sheet too. So you end up with areas where the lining is bunched up. When you stick your hand in the pocket to separate the lining from the Velcro sheet, it actually chews up your hand. Not kidding at all! I’ve washed it several times now, hoping the plastic sheet inside might break down some and soften up. So far this has not happened. I should have returned it right away, but I was so excited I finally replaced my saddle blanket denim jacket of years gone by, I held on to it, hoping it might get better. So far I am completely disappointed. Maybe I should run it over with my truck a few times and see if that helps... SMH. Oh! And another poor design flaw. As I said, the holster is a joke. If your pistol falls out of the holster, it ends up in swimming around at the bottom of the inside of the jacket between the lining and the outer denim layer. It’s worse than trying to dig the tv remote control from down inside the couch. I should have immediately returned the jacket when I opened the shipping bag."
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,A bad jacket,1,"The jacket wasn't just too large, it was massive.  Rather like wearing a poncho and it most certainly wasn't a viable concealed carry jacket.  It looked cheap and the concealed carry feature is useless.  I returned it."
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,"Decent, not outstanding.",3,"Looks good, fits a bit short in the arms, but definitely ""light-use"" fabric. The sewn-in concealed carry pockets are of flimsy material. The provided ""holster"" is quiet cheap...had to modify with a Chicago screw to keep pistol from falling right through it.It's a great idea. Would be much improved with sturdier fabric and construction."
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,SOOOO much room for improvement,2,"Ordered the tall size, and wanted a jacket for concealed carry.I tried everything from a .380 to a 1911, and this jacket pulled and profiled EVERYTHING. There are huge, stiff Velcro panels inside that make the jacket bulky, noisy when you move, and push up under your chin when you sit down. They inverted “standard” Velcro(soft on holster), so you can’t use many aftermarket holsters. Useless for carry.Size was okay. In order to get sleeves long enough, the body of the jacket was a bit large and long.Why two stars? It’s comfy. The denim came soft like it’s broken in, the jacket is warm but breathes. I like the soft collar and blanket lining. I tore out the large Velcro panels for carry."
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,It has a very weak structure,1,"the product is very weak, the denim is very thin. The velcro that exists inside is in the form of tape, which is split with any heavy object that is attached. It is a bad investment"
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Missing Most Important Piece,1,"This jacket has a large and deep pocket on the inside of both front panels. The pockets are lined with velcro. They state in the advertisement that they supply a velcro lined pocket HOLSTER with the jacket. So you can put your pistol in the pocket holster and then use the velcro to mount it inside the inner pocket. However, there was no holster included!?!? What is the use of having a conceal carry jacket if you have no holster attachment to carry it??"
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Great jacket,5,The jacket is fantastic and is very comfortable.  But when you order they are big size . I ordered a size larger than I normally wear  I wear a large and it was way to big so I went for a size I wear and well it is still large. But is very comfortable and yes I will order again . A great jacket. It keeps me warm and keeps my conceal as it should be concealed. Yes a great jacket.
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Not a wind breaker,4,Not that worm in a cold wind.  The reason you buy this jacket works good.  You will look a little puffy - but you won't look like your packin'.
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,LARGE. size down.,4,I sized down and got a jacket twice as big as the one I currently wear. the conceal pockets are huge. I do not like the velcro in it it is so stiff. I did reorder in a smaller size to see if it will work for me.
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Awesome and comfortable jacket.,5,"I like the look of this coat,i have been looking for a jean jacket and found this concealed carry jacket. I love the Velcro pockets.  The holster that comes with the coat is pretty big.  My concealed is a smaller gun, I even tried my full size 1911 in the holster and it was still loose.  I wish the elastic band on the holster was capable of being tightened."
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,"Concealed pocket tears up hands and doesn't support holster,  it drop to bottom of too deep pocke t",1,"The concealeed pocket shouldn't have rough Velcro, shouldn't be one big pocket- two separate pockets would be more functional. A small one a to to clip a proper holster into then second lower pocket"
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Not practical for smaller frame pistols.,3,The Velcro attaching pocket is too large for small frame concealed pistols. Would be easier to retrieve if was a smaller pocket with a Velcro flap!!
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,A bad buy,1,"Way too big, very poorly made feels like iam wearing a 50 year old jacket, I thought it was a used one, sending it back!!!"

Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Nice jacket.,3,"The only issue is the holster inside is too big. The weapon is not secure and falls through, no matter what size I use. Need to be able to adjust it or have different sizes available. Overall the jacket is nice and has a good liner."
Wrangler Men's Concealed Carry Blanket Lined Denim Jacket,Too uncomfortable,3,They used the wrong side of the velcro for the concealed carry. It is stiff and rippled. It is noisy and uncomfortable.

Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,GREAT JACKET; TWO FLAWS,4,"This really is an impressive little jacket, but there are two flaws you need to be aware of:1) Jacket runs VERY large. Order one size smaller than your go-to jacket size if you want a solid fitting.  If you love huge, baggy jackets, then order your regular size.  I’m 6’2” at 240lbs, football player, and ordered a L and i have plenty of room.  Yeah.... crazy right? I haven’t worn anything in size Large in over 15 years, let alone a jacket!2) Price point is a bit much for the jacket for its value.  Sure, it’s a fantastic fall/spring light coat, but for $70-100, you can definitely find some competent competitors in the soft shell market out there.  If you happen to have the money and a thin jacket is worth the ~$80 then go for it, it’s a solid jacket.  If you’re right on money, just know there are MANY other brands out there with equal or better products for this kind of dough.  I was a college student once and I know how it goes.Just my two cents.  Happy jacket hunting!"
Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Awesome jacket,4,Love this light jacket! It’s perfect for overcast/semi rainy days. Keeps you warm and dry for mild to semi cold weather.

Under Armour Men's Barrage Soft Shell Jacket,Perfect fitment - high quality,5,"I had this on my wish list for over a year and forgot about it, but when i received notification that the price dropped by 50% I jumped on it. Fitment and quality on par with expectations, overall happy with the jacket."

Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,"Nice jacket with a cheaply made, fragile zipper.",3,"Nice jacket with a lining. I was happy with it when I got it. Well done in every way except the zipper. Cheaply made zipper that can pull apart at the bottom very easily. It seems to repair itself but, if I had it to do over again, I would pass."
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Poor Fit,2,"I cannot understand why American companies, and even the premium names like Chaps or Izod, put up with the absence of quality control.  You would think they could at least provide patterns for various sizes and reject items that simply don't fit.  This jacket looks good until you try it on and then it fails completely.  It's over-sized and the sleeves are about 2+ inches too long.  I would be willing to bet that going to a size smaller would only result in something too small to be comfortable.  Think I've about given up on buying clothes online."
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,"Nice Jacket, but.....",3,"I like this jacket. It’s nicely made and fits fairly well. So why only three stars? The sleeves are about an inch too long, and the pockets are too shallow. For those reasons, I took off one star. My big beef is the color—it’s too far removed from what is shown in the description. I expected an attractive, light beige, color as shown—befitting a social setting. Instead, the color looks more industrial, like it belongs on a factory floor. For that reason, I subtracted two more stars. Like I said, it’s a nice jacket, so I’ll keep it and wear it to Home Depot and other mundane outings."
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Jacket that looks great and reasonably priced.,5,"Nice look, washable, full zipper and casual.  Been looking for a nice jacket for my man, but didn't want a sweatshirt or partial zipper.  This jacket can be worn to church or anywhere.  I find so many great things on Amazon."
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Quallity Workmanship,5,"While the jacket is made with quality craftsmanship, the size I ordered is marginal.  I ordered a XXL, and while I can wear it, I find it seems like a small XXL, especially at the waist.  Perhaps it is made that way intentionally, I'm not sure.  Despite the size issue, it is a quality made jacket."
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Just exactly what I was looking for.,5,"I am more that happy with this wind breaker. It is light weight, the color is perfect and the fit is as expected and very comfortable. The price is really a bonus for such a good Jacket."
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Very nice jacket.,4,I really love this jacket. It's the right color and a great fit. The only draw back is the liner. Not thrilled with the blue checkered pattern.
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Perfect light weight jacket for all weather.,5,Outstanding jacket in appearance and weight. Just what I was looking for and has held up well in both dry and wet weather. It has one inside pocket and two pockets in the front. If I had a suggestion it would be to add a second pocket inside.
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,nice looking but low quality zipper,2,This is a nice looking jacket but unfortunately I had to return as the zipper came apart at the bottom within the first few weeks.

Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Excellent jacket,5,Smart looking jacket to grab on cool days or when eating out in cold restaurants. Just the right weight.
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Not a Chaps jacket,1,I returned this jacket.  It was not made by Chaps.  It was a knock off.  I would like to know how it can be advertised as a Chaps jacket when a Chaps jacket is not sent.The Amazon return system worked well beyond my expectations.  I received full credit before they even received the returned jacket.  Kudos to Amazon's return procedure.
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Comes very quickly,5,Very nice light jacket that is form fitting. Good price as well.
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,The sleeves were about a half inch too long,5,"First time I have ordered a clothing item on line. I got the first order too large, but had no problem returning it and didn't cost me. I reordered and the new one arrived on time.Having a husband who served in Vietnam, I wasn't  too happy to see that this jacket was made in Vietnam. Would prefer one made in the USA"

Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Five Stars,5,Thanks for the jacket if this really nice I appreciate it
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Five Stars,5,No complains
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Looks hand tailored!,5,"First, let me address the confusion about the front pockets. Some people have said that they are ""faux"" or non-functional pockets - that is not correct. Interestingly, even though Chaps is considered a mid-range brand for Ralph Lauren, this particular jacket is treated to a more high-end treatment with the pockets being sewn shut with a sparse stitching, to keep the jacket looking very tailored and to keep the pocket openings from flaring out and making the jacket look worn or dilapidated.It is very easy to cut the stitching and open the pockets if you choose to use them, or you can choose to leave them sewn shut if you would prefer the jacket to retain the ""brand new"" or ""freshly tailored"" look that sewing the pockets gives it.The jacket is well-made and has a very nice looking inner liner, and a soft, almost brushed cotton feel to it. The jacket, quite honestly, looks like a much more expensive jacket than it actually is here on Amazon. I would have expected it to cost about twice what it does!Finally, I typically wear an XL and this jacket fits me perfectly in a size L. So keep that in mind when ordering, it seems to run a little large. The fit is very tailored and is not ""athletic"" but it does tend to have a slim fit - quite simply, it looks fabulous.  I would recommend this in a heartbeat, especially at the surprisingly low price it is available for here on Amazon!"
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Chaps Men's Microfiber Jacket,5,"A quality jacket with a classic fit and style that is flattering on most people. Lightweight microfiber shell but the garment has substance. The shell is 100 percent polyester and the lining for the body is 60 percent cotton and 40 percent polyester with the sleeve lining 100 percent polyester. The full length front nylon zipper operates smoothly and has an easy to locate pull tab.Inside the jacket is a vertical welt pocket with a button closure that measures 5 1/2 inches across and 5 1/2 inches deep along with an open inside chest pocket that is 5 inches across and 6 inches deep. There are two exterior front waist welt pockets measuring 5 inches across and 5 inches deep. The jacket is lined with a simple tattersall print fabric in the body and a slightly more satiny fabric is used in the sleeves to help arms slide through.There are two buttons spaced an inch apart on the two inch cuff so it can be adjusted for a closer fit. The collar is three inches high and there is a loop at the inside back of the neck so the jacket may be placed on a hook.  A spare button is included in case of loss or damage.Within the bottom edge a 1 1/2 inch high piece of elastic is triple stitched in place so when zipped the jacket readily flexes and moves with the wearer. The size large is the in house male’s size and this jacket fits exactly as expected. Laundry care is machine wash in cold water with like colors, non-chlorine bleach when needed and tumble dry low. A low heat iron may be used if desired and the jacket may be dry cleaned. Well made, good looking jacket."
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Front pockets are faux.  Otherwise very well made & good looking,4,"- Hanging loop at neck, 2 labels, easy remove- 2 front pockets are faux(!!)- Hip elastic gives about 2"" stretch, none in the rest of jacket- Sleeves about 22.5"" long at armpit seam, incl 2"" cuff, single button, 2 position- Inside left pocket, side entry, button closure, inside right pocket, top entry, no closure. Both will probably hold most wallets/phones- Made in China, imported from Mexico- Machine wash cold, separately, non-chlorine bleach if need.  Tumble low.  Iron cool.- Torso lined with a thin, softer cotton-feeling fabric.  Arms lined with the usual slick stuff- Stitching is notably excellent.- Subtle brand logo left chest, done in dark blue thread. Quite tasteful.I've heard of Chaps but I hadn't seen them around for some time.  This seems to be very well made.  Great feeling fabrics, firm weave, no flaws.  Stitching is among the best I've seen.  I can barely even find new spool switches.Which stuns me all the more that the front pockets are faux.  Maybe I'm too attached to pockets, but to me it's just totally baffling.  On top of that, the listing info says they're real.  Info discrepancy in online shopping is a very big deal to me and this takes a star off.Otherwise it's a comfortable, quite toasty, good looking jacket.Don't forget to use the Smile.Amazon.com address - It's an Amazon program where many things you buy every day will generate a small donation to the charity of your choice.

Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,There are pockets--but you have to work  to get 'em,4,"As others have pointed out this is a very well-made jacket but the two outer welt pockets are sewn shut. After googling ""why are the pockets sewn shut,"" I discovered that clothing manufacturers sometimes do this to keep an expensive garment looking fresh and unrumpled and that you can just remove the stitching and get your functional pocket. If you rub the jacket between your fingers in the area of the pocket, you can feel that there is, in fact, a pocket liner in there.Here's what you do: Look under the exterior flap of the pocket and you'll see a band of fabric about 1/4 inch wide that looks like it could be pocket liner material. It has two lines of stitches. With a razor blade, just carefully cut the *interior-most* line of single-stitching in *one* place. Now you can just pull the pocket apart! Go slowly and after that first cut, just pull out a few stitches and slide a your pinky in there to make sure that you feel the inside of the pocket.This is a five star jacket for the reasons that other reviewers have pointed out--I agree with them and I'm not going to repeat or contradict them. I'm docking the jacket one star for this ridiculous pocket nonsense."
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Very good jacket for moderately cold temperatures,4,"Chaps is a brand you used to hear all the time, then not so much.  This nice jacket is proof they're still around, and making high-quality clothing.I wore the jacket this morning, over a sweatshirt, when it was about 50 degrees outside and a little breezy.  Perfect jacket for such conditions.  I stayed warm but was never stifled or hot.The blue color is nice and the material comfortable.  Main drawback for me -- and this is why I deducted a star from my overall rating -- is that the two pockets on the front of the jacket aren't real (see my photo #1).  Maybe it's just a trendy designer thing, but I would have preferred real pockets there.  There is a button-up pocket on the inside left of the jacket (photo #2), and another real pocket on the inside right side (photo #3).Bottom line:  this jacket is warmer than a windbreaker but lighter than many other jackets.  So it's good."
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Could not exchange for proper size.,5,"The quality and style of the jacket was every bit as I had hoped.  However, the size I ordered was much too big.  Since the item was a daily special, replacing with the proper size would have cost me several times the price. So, I had to return the coat for cash back. I was able to find the item in a store locally for less than the price you have set.  I bought two of the proper size and in colors I liked better than the black one I got on Amazon.  Had I known i could not exchange for the right size, I would have ordered several sizes and simply returned all but the one that fit.  Other people I know do this regularly."
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Chaps quality with classic style,5,"I’ve always felt comfortable in Chaps clothes. They are very American and have a classic look. This jacket is no different. It isn’t flashy or anything like that. It gives you a confident look that is masculine and solid. The quality is on the upper end of the scale with excellent fabrics and workmanship. The pockets are like the pockets of an expensive suit, they are sewn shut to preserve the lines in transit.If you are looking for a top quality lightweight jacket to wear on cool Autumn days, this is an excellent choice. I really like it."
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Nice Jacket but a Flaw,2,This jacket by Chaps has a nice color and it fits well.  My husband says most men may not like the baggy sleeves but he does.  He loves the color and the comfortable fit of the jacket.  The one issue he has with the jacket is the zipper.  The zipper seem to be a little flimsy and catches on the material as you attempt to zip it up. If the zipper was constructed a little more sturdier it would be a good jacket.
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Nice Navy Jacket,4,"This jacket is ideal for fall/spring weather in the Ohio Valley; where on any given day the temperatures vary throughout the day. The uncertain temperatures can make it difficult to decide what to wear. This jacket is perfect on those cold mornings walks with the pup while not overheating the hubby as temperatures rise throughout the day.The hubby dislikes the fake pockets on the outside, only has internal pockets."
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Useless pockets,2,Jacket is great as long as you don't plan on putting anything like keys into a pocket. The pockets are shallow and useless and there is no zipper or button to secure them.I would not have made this purchase if I knew how horrible the pockets are.
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Comfortable and great looking jacket,4,"This is a classic design jacket that never gets out of date. Easy to pull on, yet somehow looks casual stylish.Great quality materials and well constructed.Fits just as expected. Can be washed at home, which is awesome."
Chaps Men's Classic Fit Full-Zip Microfiber Jacket,Excellent jacket,5,"I got this for my son who is extremely picky about his clothes. He loved it. Everyone compliments him on it. It fits well, has a nice cut and a beautiful color. It seems really well made and comfortable"
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Dont order a Size bigger. Be warned.,4,"After reading all the people saying this jacket is too small for their so called ""Fit Frame""  I decided to order a large. I am 5'9 and weigh 195, i have broad shoulders and am very fit with little fat. WITH THAT SAID, This large is very big, and baggy. I like the material however I need a size smaller, Medium. The problem I had was not understanding the review of others are very subjective to their style. I personally like to have a form fitting look but where I can move easily and it is not too tight just as the pictures reflect. However the reviews of others have misconstrued my belief of what size I should have purchased. Now I gotta wait again and return the other. My advice is to order the normal size you usually get, or look at their dimensions and get a tailors measuring tape and cofirm your bodies proportions. This baggy style may have been cool back in 1990s, but I need a more contemporary fit.I hope this helps."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,"Quality matches the price, size ran somwhat large in my case.",4,"I am 6' 2"" and 186 lbs, fit/athletic build and my measurements are 40 Chest, 16 Sleeve, 48 Overarm, 35 Waist & 39 Hip.I went with the ""US L = Tag 4XL"" considering how many people mentioned it runs small. I found the large to be slightly too big. I like clothing that fits as tight as possible but does not inhibit my movement at all. There is definitely extra room, especially the torso/chest. I will be returning it and getting the US M.You can refer to my pictures to see my frame, followed by my identifying the extra material/room in the arm and torso/waist, as well as the shoulder being a tad too wide.As for the coat, it was just the right amount of fluff and thickness I am looking for. This should work for 35-60F degree weather. Any more above or below that might be too hot or cold, assuming no wind. Bad English labels & washing instructions, but what can you expect. There is a small bit of fake, dark brown leather around the bottom front pocket buttons. The straps around the wrists are useless; when buttoned, they do not constrict tighter around your wrist at all.Material seems great/reasonable for the price. Not amazing, but more than satisfying."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,"Nice sweater, very nice.",5,"To clear up some of the confusion,  i am 5.7 at 180lbs slim built with a tad of muscle.My arm sleeves lenght is 26"" measuring  from the beginning  of the wrist to the beginning  of the top shoulder, measuring from the outside of my are not the inside to the arm pit. My chest measured 46"" around nipple to nipple.So i went by the Garment Measurements  below,  avoid all the others listed to not get confused.I purchesed the winter  coat with 6 pockets outside and one inside.Well, it showed to be small. But wait,  i never wear small in a coat, im always medium to large in the States.Well, i went by what the Garment Measurements  down below and to a chance on small. I like semi tight fit, not tight but not loose to the point my coat dances on me. The coat arrived and it fit perfectly so go by the Measurements that read GARMENT MEASUREMENTS. Having said that, i can wear a slim t shirt or a slim thin sweater underneath along with the coat. If you will be wearing a thick sweater underneath,  grab one size up. Hope this helps  because reading all the other reviews here did not help me none as some were talking garbage."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Great quality keep in mind the size you order though.,5,I was scared ordering this because usually when products come from a different country they run way smallerv than U.S. size even if I buy the largest.Howeverb this product fit perfectly a bit snug on my upper arms and back but im a tad muscular. Im 5'9 180lbs I ordered the largest size XXXL.The quality of the product was excellent and the faux fur lining super soft and warm. I haven't washed it yet for fear of shrinking regardless the quality of this jacket does not look or feel cheap the hood is detachable.
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,"Doesn't look as good as photo, but very practical.",3,"Having bought other clothing items from Amazon before, I knew to have low expectecations in regards to looks and just the feel of the item and it was just about what I expected it to be. The pictures do far more justice than the actual item in real life but I bought this to go camping and didn't want to mess up any of my real jackets so with that in mind, this jacket works perfectly. It's quite warm, has all practical pockets and even though small usually runs quite snug on me, this was a tiny bit looser, which I don't mind at all. It should serve my purpose but don't expect it to look as chic as the picture suggests."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Great Value Nice Jacket,5,This is my new favorite jacket. It’s reasonably warm for the spring. Its stylish but not as slim fit as it looks on the model. Overall a great value. The stitching is not like the $100+ jackets at the department stores but the quality is good. (Only wore the jacket for a couple weeks so far). The zipper also isn’t smooth as others have mentioned.
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Inaccurate photos,3,"The Jacket does not have a tapered look like the pictures show.  the waist measurement on this jacket is the same as the chest measurement.  This would let a lot of cold air in.  I ordered a large to fit my shoulders and chest correctly but the waist is way too baggy.The zipper is also very cheap plastic and snags easily.  I would expect this to wear out fast.I gave it 3 stars because the material is still nice and the price is good, but I really did not like the inaccurate shape that the seller gives."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Chinese Seller,2,"Jacket too small. Size is inaccurate. Tried to read the care instructions, but they were all in broken English and Chinese."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,"Second time ordered, second time receiving the wrong jacket",3,"Still was sent the wrong jacket, but the one I got works just fine. I'll keep this one I was sent as it is very similar to the product show, but there are quite a few differences that are clear indicators that the jacket I received is not the one I ordered.As for the jacket I did order, it fits perfect. The inside is nice and warm. The material seems quite durable and I will be happy with what I got. Hopefully amazon gets their stuff together and starts sending people the right products."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Sizes sizes,5,"After long searches, I finally decided to take a chance on this jacket. It had everything I was looking for. A pocket on the inside, not to light not to heavy. Loved how it was all fuzzy on the inside. What really helped with the sizing is one of the reviews where a guy bought the same jacket in large but was way to big. My bf and him are around the same measurements so I went with a medium. (He has a chest of 40' ~ and waist of 32. )I'm sick of him wear jackets that are way to big for him! I'm so happy with this, good quality and super soft. His new favorite jacket."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Comfy & Warm...,5,"This was a gift for my husband and he said that this jacket is much warmer & much more comfy than he expected it to be... He also said that he wasn't sure if the fit was supposed to be as loose as it was, but he wasn't complaining, because he said it's better that it's like that and isn't too tight.  So if you want it to look just like in the photo, you might want to measure yourself and use those measurements to order your size.  If he wanted it to fit like the photo I should've ordered it a size smaller, I went bigger so he could wear bulky shirts/sweaters underneath too, not just t-shirts."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,"Decent, not bad for price  but not the greatest",4,"Ordered product , numerous sellers of same product.  Not disappointed  good price for what I got. - i weight 150ib, 5""9, fit lean muscle ,product does go larger then usual from what I've  read and have .- collar  top button is VERY tight compared to size of jacket.Pictures hide the weird front logo,Inside  material definite  keeps you warm chest are but stops at the armpit area.Strings should be more knot secure, leather thing is not tied properly and will come undone.I wouldn't mind paying the extra price If that made a more genuine one."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,"solid jacket, warm too",5,"solid, well-fitting (somewhat tight but snug) jacket. Lining is warm. Stops wind. Pockets are a little small compared to other jackets. I really like the jacket overall and feel it was a great purchase & value, but just two weird things to keep an eye on: 1) the breast pockets are different, one is a flap with a button and the other is a zipper; I'd prefer these to be symmetrical, 2) the zipper is on the ""wrong"" side -> vs. what I'd expect, the zipper to physically be on the right side of the jacket, but instead it is on the left. Neither of these are dealbreakers on an otherwise great jacket."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Not thrilled,2,"The coat ripped in two places in less than a month. On the arm, on the seam. I sewed it figured ok. A week later the zipper ripped off. I was going to return it but it was just 30 days from when it arrived so I couldn’t. My husband loves it but it’s cheaply made"
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Nice for price.,4,I ordered 1 size bigger and fits fine. It summertime now but it seems light weight yet warm.  Zipper is standard cheap  zipper not military grade and is a bit confusing since its left handed. Look closely at the picture in  and the zipper is on opposite side. If you can get past that seems like a nice jacket other than the hand Pockets being a bit small. For the price its well worth it unless u want to pay top dollar for a name brand that is equal to or less quality.
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Awesome Sauce F***ing product.,5,"I am 5'5"" 189lbs. I read reviews about not ordering a size up. So I ordered medium instead of large. Happy with the product. It is snug where it needs to be. I have enough room for about a 10lb weight gain. No wind can be felt through the jacket which is a plus. You can see in the pictures that I am.overweight and the jacket, which is a medium, fits great. I just wish that the bottom length where it sits on the upper thigh was a bit shorter but it is not a bother."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,"Keeps cold out, looks great.",5,"My boyfriend is stubborn and doesn't like coats. He doesnt like how he looks in them and often complains they're annoying. I bought him this because we live where winter is cold and we both hate the cold and I knew itd look good.He loves it. Hes never appreciated a coat before and wears it every day. It keeps the cold out, looks great, even his family was impressed to see him in it on Christmas."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Was Expecting More!!!!,2,I bought this coat after the zipper went out on the one I usually wear. I was therefore especially concerned that this coat had a reliable zipper. On the first two zips the left and right sides of the coat failed to stay together. Another problem is that the zipper mechanism is on the left rather than right. This made it difficult for a right hander to zip the coat up. I would not recommend this coat.
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Perfect fit except for the hood,4,"5'7, 185 lbs athletic build; typically wear size medium but ordered a size up for this jacket.  Fits perfectly.  The hood is slightly on the awkward small side but still functional if need be, and can be removed.It does look good and the compliments have rolled in wearing it."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Nice jacket,5,"Looks good and feels great. Not as thick as it looks but is good if you wear another sweater or long sleeve under. It just depends where you live and how cold it gets. But looks nice and feels nice. I’m 5’6” and 165 lbs. I think it was a little big for me, but I like my clothes more fitted. If you like comfort and don’t really cate about a fit feel, then this is great. Either way it is nice and you’ll enjoy it."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Amazing. 9.75 other than left sleeve.,5,"I absolutely love this jacket. I am a shorter person (5'4"", 125 lb)  and ordered an XS. It fits magically. I can't remember the last time I bought something online and had it fit me properly as a shorter person in the States. Literally the only thing is that the left arm seems to be a bit longer than the right.As someone that spent their time in high winds/ heavy snow weather for 3 years in upstate New York, this is definitely not a winter jacket. But if you want to wear a sweatshirt underneath and above 5 degree weather, you're golden.The inside pocket is a great touch. Great design, material, and fit. :)"
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Excellent jacket!,5,"I wish I'd ordered a size smaller.  It is much bigger than I expected, but that's not always a bad thing with a winter coat.  I'm very happy with the build quality, and the comfort.  There are lots of pockets, which I wanted and looked for when buying.  And the lining is very soft and warm and comfortable.  I definitely recommend this coat to anyone."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Warm and stylish.,5,"My husband just loved this jacket and it looked really smart and stylish for a casual jacket.  It was also very warm without feeling like he was wearing a space suit.  (joke). The size was on point, well made and the hood is detachable (but I knew that in the description of the garment). Be warned that the coat zips on the opposite side of what men are used to."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,"The coat fits well, looks good.",5,"The coat seems well made. Rugged yet stylish. I'm 5'7"", 140lbs and ordered the US medium size which fits me perfectly. If I gained 20lbs, it'd probably be too snug. The coat is long form, runs to my mid-thigh which works as this will be my primary winter coat. It comes with a patch over the left breast pocket and upper right sleeve. I carefully removed the patches with no problem. The zipper is left sided and functions well. The fleece inner-lining is a welcome feature. The hood works well and has cinches for a snugger fit.I paid $65.96 US Dollars and I am quite pleased with this purchase. I hope this review provides useful information to any tentative shoppers."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Disappointed,2,"Pictures do not adequately show the length of the jacket and the material is thinner and flimsier than the pictures. I thought it would look nicer.If you want to look like the weirdo in high school that everyone is a little scared is going to lose it, then this is the jacket for you."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,cheap and sizing too off,1,"some ppl mentioned that the sizing runs small... so i ordered MEDIUM, which was exactly like LARGE in size. So i guess the manufacturing is low q and inconsistent. Also overall feel of the jacket is ""cheap, scruffy"". Far from the product photos ""casual and hip"". So good photo taking."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,What i was looking for,5,"I'm 5'10, fluctuate between 175 - 180 lbs. I bought this jacket (US-M/Tag 3XL) for my upcoming trip to South Korea in March and wanted a military looking type jacket.  This fits what i was looking for perfectly.  It's lightweight, warm, and the pockets are helpful.My only 2, maybe 3 downsides of it are the side pockets for your hands are a bit on the smaller side, if you put your phone in them chances are they will fall out.  The hoodie (which is detachable) does cover your head but when you try to velcro the front it'll either won't close or it's to tight.And the 3rd, which is more on my end, is it's lightweight, i'd say it'll keep you nice and warm for the fall/early winter weather (you could wear long sleeves, maybe even a hoodie underneath) but since i'm expecting winter when i go on my trip, i dont think it'll hold up if it snows. Definately great if you're out on a cool night with just a shirt underneath, heavy winter, probably not. I'll try to upload pictures later when i'm off of work."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Practical and warm,5,"Great coat. I ordered one size larger because i like my coats to be slightly big so if i wear a sweatshirt, it won’t be too tight. Love that it has so many pockets especially an inside one. The furry inner lining keeps me warm. Love the hood.  Also you can tighten the waist with the string for more form fitting."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Never,5,"Need side snap button flaps to access pants pockets and belt tools.

CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Not fitted,4,"We got this for our oldest who is 12 but he’s tall for his age (5’6” 130lbs). We got him a small thinking it would be fitted or close to it but it was pretty loose. Overall he likes it a lot and I like the fit (he wanted it to be fit, I wanted room for his hoodie if he needs it)."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,IF YOU'LL PAY ATTENTION TO THE SIZES...  YOU WON'T HAVE ANY SAD SURPRISES!!!,5,"QUICK DELIVERY.  And the jacket is a PERFECT FIT.  GOOD FABRIC & WELL MADE.  I had been a bit doubtful about the sizes after reading some of the reviews, but if you read the size chart carefully and equate the U.S. sizes with the Chinese sizes, you'll get the right size jacket.  For example, I ordered the U.S. size M, which equates with the Chinese size XXXL. JUST DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF ORDERING THE CHINESE SIZE ""M"", OR YOU'LL GET A JACKET THAT WILL FIT YOUR PUPPY :)"
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Best Jacket in my Closet,5,"I love this freaking jacket! It’s warm, looks amazing, has pockets for days, fits a bit loose, but not a bad thing in my book. Just allows for more layers. I’ll be getting another just for casual wear soon. I was legitimately surprised by the quality of this jacket."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,"The material is pretty nice, although softer than I expected",4,"When ordering any kind of imported clothing, especially from Asia, disregard the tag entirely. This jacket tag says 3XL, but in the US people are way taller and bigger that average, so the actually size reflects what the description says, which is just a Large.The material is pretty nice, although softer than I expected. I don't think it's rainproof, but it's warm enough for California winters. Pockets are capable, but not excessive. Front zipper pocket is good for keys and small items."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Great choice for me.,4,"Love the fit and design of this jacket. Also it's warmer than I expected which is a plus. Took a while to get the size right as I wanted a slim fit. I'm 5'9"" 145 lbs and settled on a extra small (us) - after returning a medium - for the best fit. I typically wear a small in jackets. Pockets are a bit small but not a big deal to me."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Warm jacket. Nice look. Good quality.,5,I really like the quality of this lined and hooded jacket/coat. I had to return for a smaller size as we ordered a xxl and it's more like a coat and he wanted it tighter. Although he's a big young man. I would recommend this. We just need a XL.
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,The sizes don't make sense.,3,"I returned it because it didn't fit.  The sizes when upwards from XL to XXL to XL-plus.  Well apparently XL plus is literally just XL, instead of bigger than XXL. It makes no sense. Returned immediately."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Light weight and comfortable.,5,My 17 year old bought this. He loves that it is light weight and comfortable.  He has gotten compliments and asked where he got it. Only complaint is  that color faded fast. It’s his go to jacket.
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Best Jacket I’ve ever Purchased,5,"Best Jacket I’ve ever purchased. I am 5’11 male who weighs around 178 lbs, a medium size fit perfectly. This jacket has all the essentials for warmth. Under jacket fur, optional buttons for secure warmth, and regular jacket cuffs within the sleeves. The amount of pockets are great as well. This jacket will look pretty good on anyone. Just one word of advice, don’t be rough with the zipper, it’s good quality but needs adjustment with alignment. Take the few seconds to zip it properly rather then damaging your jacket. Was nervous to purchase due to a different customer displaying their zipper predicament. I’m pleased to know that I don’t regret it and I’m looking forward to the fall when the snow comes around."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,"Go with one size less , it will fit",5,"I’m 5’11 190 pounds usually wearing large in everything but with this Jacky I was with medium and was perfect In every angle  , I do workout so I have some muscles 💪🏽, and it fit me very well"
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,"Fits well, follow the size chart",4,"Fit well, I have a 42"" chest, 19"" shoulders and am 6' exactly and 185,  and the Small fit perfectly.  Quality is decent, fits the $59 role.  Great fall jacket, anything below 30 you'll need something better.  Shame it's chinese, because I bet a designer could throw really good materials at it and make it way better."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Decent Jacket,3,"Excellent winter jacket. Only downside I found immediately was the zipper. It seems to have difficulty catching, leading to the jacket not zipping up correctly.Considering the price that’s okay, but I would’ve rated higher if not for that."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Not what you think,2,It doesn’t look how you want or expect it to look. Skip it.
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Fits as advertised.,5,"Admittedly, I was pretty concerned. I read reviews after I had made the purchase. Most reviews complained that it fit way too small. I have trouble with jackets around the shoulders. I even tried to cancel, but alas they would not let me. I ordered a different one form another manufacturer assuming this one was going to be a bust. Nope, It fits comfortably. This large is actually a large and I really like the jacket. Nice jacket. I wish it zipped up on the right side instead of the left, but otherwise, it's perfect."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,"Quality, comfort, and a good fit",5,"This jacket has definitely held up. I've used it in the woods, while working nights, and while working on a car in freezing weather. Never had any regret for this purchase. Fit was great and its a comfortable jacket."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Warmer than expected,5,"I bought this is a nice light coat for like fall to spring (which is like 40°F to 60°F where I am). This coat is way to warm for that, and I am just out walking on city streets. I would wear this coat for temps around 0°F to 30°F.Besides that, it fits great and the sleeves are a great length. They might be a bit longer than expected though. For the size that would fit my chest (~39 in) the sleeves come to the center of my palm. Which I like."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Looks a bit cheap in person,3,Definitely looks a bit cheap in person for my taste. Not knocking anyone that likes it though but its not for me.
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Perfect Men's Winter Jacket!,4,"It fit my boyfriend great! And it is super warm on the inside, so it is perfect for the winter months. However, lint and cat hair gets on it pretty easily, so if you have a cat, don't let 'em lay on it. But a good lint roller gets it all off. Overall, my boyfriend loved it and has worn it everyday ever since he got it for Christmas!"
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Not as warm as I expected,3,Just worn this jacket in mid 30's with a mid weight sweater and still felt  a chill during an hour walk.  I won't wear this is colder weather without a wool sweater.
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,My husband was so pleased!,5,"This was a Christmas present for my husband and this jacket replaced all the other old jackets I couldn’t get him to throw away.  Beautiful army green, warm and soft inner lining, lots of pockets. It checked all the boxes for him and it’s stylish and different which checked the box for me. Highly recommend!"
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,It's a Women's Jacket,2,"Although they are listed as Men's Jacket, the closure is female. (Opposite side zipper) So I sent it back. If I wanted a Women's coat, I would habe bought one."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Nice,5,"5' 6"" , 138lbs, athletic build.  Ordered ex-small.  Chest/shoulders fit nice and snug.  I wish it tapered at the waist, but I prefer my clothes form fitting.Comfortable, and seems well made.  Pretty thick, made for colder weather.I would recommend it."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Size description is not correct,3,"I wear a US medium size. I order medium size - too large. Then I returned the product and ordered small one - still large. I don't think the size description is correct. Order one or two size small.This jacket is bulky so if you wear a fitting kind of jacket, this is not for you."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,This was a good buy.,4,"I do not like bulky jackets, especially when driving and this jacket is perfect. It fits really well and is surprisingly warm, even when just wearing a t-shirt underneath. The only reason for the 4 star is I find that the hand pockets are too small. But even so, this is the only jacket I grab on my way out the door. BEWARE OF THE SIZES: Thanks to other reviews, I chose to order the large size, which actually fits perfectly on a small frame. I am 5'8"" and weigh in at 148 lbs. The large fits perfect."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Zipper is broken at no fault of mine. Thanks for replacing the coat and such a timely matter,4,The zipper come apart after wearing the coat only three times. I took it to a seamstress and they were not able to fix it. The zipper on this particular coat would hang up in several different spots when zipping it up. Overall I am happy with the coat. Company replace the bad one with a new one within 3 days. Thank you
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Wrong color,3,The color was a ugly brown and a little large also i looks like the coat was for a woman because of the way the zipper was installed.. How ever with the help on Amazon the company discounted the price by 30% and  allowed me to keep it. I plan on giving it charity
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,The Measurements ARE WRONG!,1,It was tight despite my following the measurement charts.  I ended up giving it to my nephew and just ordering another field jacket from another company.  I warn you guys...it's a gamble and what I think it comes down to is probably measurement chart/table are right but manufacturing isn't accurate.
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Great jacket!,5,I love this jacket. But you need to watch the size I usually wear an XL but I had to order a XXL. I'm 6-5 and weigh 220 lb. If that helps you.
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Great fit.,5,Great fit and great look for my body type. Ordered a 2XL  Took a little bit to get used to the the zipper zipping on the other side.
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,XL tight at waist,4,I am 42 inches at my waist but the jacket fit comfortably everywhere else.

CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Size is everthing.,4,I'm 5'8  135 Pounds. I'm a small person.Size small was way too big for me.Returned jacket and ordered a XS small.Fits just right and good looking. I know it is from China.Not much of anything is made in USA anymore. Get use to it.
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Somewhat bigger than what I expected,5,"Really nice jacket. Love the color. It keeps me warm. I think these run a little bigger than what I expected. I should probably picked a smaller size. However, I can wear extra clothes under it."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Nice jacket / Ugly lining,4,"The jacket is pretty good. But i do have a complaint. The lining of this jacket, at least for the army color, is a dark green, fleece, like fur material and it's kind of ugly lol. It's not that warm but I typically layer a hoody underneath it and haven't had any other issues with it."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,It fits real nice just pay attention to the sizing though,5,"My husband loves this coat. It fits real nice just pay attention to the sizing though. I bought my husband who is a size medium,a large(tag size is 3x) because it’s a coat and he always where’s sweaters underneath and it fits perfect. Make sure if your in America you pay attention to the Americans sizes!!!!"

CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Great buy.,4,"The front of the jacket will ripple when sitting and it seems to be stretching the zipper. No other wear has occurred to me.Only part of the jacket I can't seem to use well, is the face covering attached to the hood. Has been washed more than a few times by now, and didn't bleed or lose material."
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,More than I expected for an inexpensive jacket.,4,Looks great and is quite warm. I'd say good down to the low 40s.Only thing I dont like is the zipper is backward (on the wrong side like a woman's jacket)
CRYSULLY Men's Fall Fashion Long Sleeve Lightweight Cargo Jacket Military Front Zip Coat Jacket Khaki,Just slightly loose,5,"5'9 185, 44 chest/36 waist. The US/EU large (JP XL, CN 4Xl) fit pretty good. Slightly loose with just a tshirt underneath and fits pretty well with a hoody underneath!"

EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,This is such a badass jacket!,5,"Anyone who is looking for a top quality m65 jacket this is the jacket for you. Look no further. Ive had rothco before which is pretty much the same kind of jacket but this jacket basically is the rothco m65 juiced up on roids. This is such a great jacket. As soon as I opened up the package I knew it was gonna fit right. The quality is thick. Its not thin and I was concerned the sleeves were gonna be longer than my arms and theyre just right. This jacket fits me perfectly and as expected. I am 510 170 lbs and the jacket fits perfectly all around and i ordered a medium, which is hard for me to find a perfect formed jacket that actually fits. The look is completely badass. This is gonna be my go to jacket for sure this fall. I collect jackets and this one will def be used. Theres a bunch of comments people have left about sizing being wrong. Disregard those posts because they had me concerned at first but fear not this jacket fits as expected..."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Ummm...,3,"How the hell do you people size your stuff?! I got a 3xl, the torso fits like an XL and the arms fit like a 3XL. Did you mix and match sizes or something? Other than that the jacket is beautiful. Returning it though..."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Deceptive photograph hides ""slim fit.""",2,"The quality of this piece is very good.  But worse, the seller's photography gives the impression that the jacket is blousy and so would fit most normal people, who, in the United States, are not slim 18-year-olds.  Well, it fit me okay, but too tight generally, and nothing like the windbreaker I expected from the photography."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Perfect fit and much better than expected.,5,"I almost never write reviews but this time is different.  This jacket exceeds my expectations. It's very hard for me to find a good it in anything but I liked the look so much I took a chance and I'm very happy I did. I'm 6' 3"" inches and 260 lbs. The 2xl is a perfect fit. The length fits like it was a tall size which is what I alway look for."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"This jacket deserves a 5 star rating, but .....",4,"The jacket is great! My husband is very pleased! Can't wait for cooler weather so he can wear it! And, if the vendor will finally answer a question I've now asked twice, I'll change my rating to 5 stars without hesitation. Question: How do we clean this jacket when we have to? There were no instructions in the package when it arrived. That's all I want. Should be simple, right?"
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,WOW!!  Incredibly Surprised!!!,5,"For the past few years I've attempted to buy clothing from Asian manufacturers and had very little luck do to vast sizing issues.  When I ordered this jacket (khaki), I thought it would be the same but I was WRONG!  This jacket is amazing!As soon as I took it out of the packaging I was in awe.  I couldn't stop smiling because the jacket was even BETTER than I thought it was going to be when I ordered it.  The khaki is a beautiful rich color, ALL the pockets (snap and zipper) are REAL pockets (even thought I read in reviews that some were fake), stitching and snaps look great, and the great surprise to me was the accent stitching down the sleeves.  I had no idea that accent was there when ordering but it's the perfect Star Wars look that I looking to achieve for a costume.Fit is perfect and is true to size.  I'm 5'9.5"" and around 205 lbs and the Large fits perfectly.This jacket has a really good weight to it and is perfect for cooler early spring or fall weather.  My only complaint is that the zipper pull is on the left side instead of the normal right side, but I think that's just how they do it in Europe/Asia.Overall, I'm elated with this jacket.  So much so that I just bought another one because I had originally planned on ripping out/hiding the zippers for the costume, but it's such a nice jacket I want to wear it a daily jacket.  Heck, the first time I wore it in public the first person that saw gave me a compliment on it.  It's really that nice.  An incredible value and I give it 5 stars which I RARELY give on product reviews."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,A note on size,4,"I'm 6' 1""-2"", 180-lb male slender male with 34""-inch waist and slightly broad shoulders, and ordered a Large jacket. If anything the Large is a tad long over a T-shirt with the waistband around mid-glute area ... sleeves, chest and shoulders fit very well. Over a sweatshirt or heavier clothing, the waistband comes up to just below beltline and fits perfectly ... which should be the case for larger-waisted individuals of similar height. Jacket looks great, left-side zipper is fine by me."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Great jacket and a great fit,5,"What a great jacket. It even has two top pockets. I'm 5'9"" and 190 lbs, 36"" waist, I got the large and it fit great."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,You'll look warm...but not classy.,2,"This product somehow looks much better in the pictures. In person it just looks...cheap. Usually I'm pretty pleased with my purchases but this just reminds me of shopping on Wish...stuff looks awesome in pictures, but what you get in the mail looks like it came from the Dollar General. The jacket fits alright, it just doesn't look impressive. Even the collar in the picture looks cool and flared out...the collar on the jacket I received looks stubby and curled in on itself. You could get something of this quality for cheaper at the derpmart."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Cosplay concept, but may have to add to Fall coat collection.",4,"I have been watching this style jacket through Wish and Banggood as well as Amazon. A significant proportion of the reviews related poor quality or numerous defects, but I was purchasing this jacket as part of a cosplay so was not entirely worried as long as quality was functional. I am looking to do a Power Loader operator or a colonial marine - still waiting for all the patches/parts to arrive to make a final decision. In the final calculation,  went with Amazon as they had the ability to return if there were issues with the jacket that I could not work around. They were significantly higher in price, but if I got a dud in quality then at least I had an option to return. All of the pockets are functional, they are a little small, but I did not have to rip any seams or make cuts to be able to use them. The material of the jacket is accurate to the pictures shown AND most importantly the sizing information provided was accurate to the size chart provided. The jacket is not at the same level of quality as I would purchase from a US coat store, but I was originally only interested in the army surplus look on the exterior for style. However, once I have finished adding design patches, this could become my new Fall jacket. An unexpected win. If there are issues with the jacket in the future, I will update my review."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,(See edit) Great jacket. Would have gotten a size M instead of L though.,3,"Really like the jacket. I'm 6'2 and weigh 170lbs. I ordered a size L based on the measurements in the photos and reviews. If I could go back and get a size M instead, I would. Then again, I like my clothes and jackets to be a little more form fitting. When I'm happy with it anyway, it's not worth the hassle of packing it back up and driving it the UPS store and await an exchange though. Just something to keep in mind when ordering.My only critique would be that the silky lining is really nice, but I would have preferred another kind of fabric for the inside of the main pockets. When it's below freezing outside and you stick your hands in your pockets, the silky material doesn't do much to warm them up. Other than that, great jacket.Edit: Taking 2 stars off. After having this jacket for 3 months, the stitching of the inside pocket has broken and a hole is widening. I'm gonna sew it back up before I lose the entire pocket, but I'm pretty disappointed that it needs to be done. All I put in that pocket is either my phone or my wallet. Nothing overtly heavy that would put stress on the stitching."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Good value purchase. But China needs to shut up.,4,"Pro: The materials used is very comfortable. Will make for a very nice Fall and Spring jacket. I may purchase another jacket so I can wear a couple more layers for additional warmth. I believe it is worthy of repeating my self - this jacket is very comfortable!Con: Made in China. Because of this, you will find that the zipper zips up on the left side (feminine). I am not at all familiar with this type of zipper. I believe the pro's and con's carry eqaul weight. Also, on one hand the Chinese want to sell this jacket. But on the other hand they are pushing propaganda on the United States and bad-mouthing U.S. buyers. Normally that would be enough to make me pass on buying, but I made the purchase before the childish communist propaganda got started."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Waist is  a narrow fit but I'm fit so it fits.,5,"Well, I love it ! Fits perfect on me. I usually fit a medium but the chart said I needed a small so I got a small.  Bam!  It fits.  I was worried but…Waist is a narrow fit but I'm  fit so it fits. BUT ! what I'm worried about is the shrink factor after it comes out of dryer.  Will it still fit or will it be a size for toddlers ? I gues I'll have to remember NOT to put in dryer but just air dry outside or something after washing in cold water.  No one has mentioned this factor so im definitely worried about that."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Nice and roomy but not baggy,5,"I'm 6'1-2"", 175# without clothes, and a 34"" waist. I wear 34"" waist pants, and normally take a medium shirt or jacket, but this jacket in a  large fits just right, with enough blousing to wear a sweater underneath without feeling too baggy without the sweater.  I think a medium would have fit like a slim fitted shirt with little room inside, so I'm glad I ordered the large. The lower elastic band pulled down rests about 4"" below the belt which allows for stretch movements while keeping the lower part of the jacket snug at or below the belt in a strong breeze, such as riding a motorcycle. The elastic cuffs ride slightly onto my hand and are snug enough to keep the wind out. Pockets with snaps have the depth of a dress shirt pocket. Zippered pockets above are deep enough to hold a 6"" cell phone when zippered. There is one deep open ended interior pocket on the left side. The jacket material feels rugged for its design, which is lighter weight.  I haven't washed it, but will probably wash it in cold water to keep the same fit."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Fits Nicely, Bit Tight In The Waist",4,"Ordered a large, I'm 5'5"" and 227 lbs, trans female to male. I have a larger chest but with my binder on or off, the jacket fits great. It's a bit tight around the waist, but I can still zip it up with a flannel shirt on. The lining material is soft and doesn't feel overly slick and uncomfortable.All of the buttons are snap buttons and it's light to mid-weight enough to wear out on a day that's going to start out around 'see your breath' temperatures and end in the 70s. Throw a sweater or flannel under it and you're good to go for chillier weather. The ribbed fabric around the bottom, wrists, and neck is soft and keeps snow out. Not too tight or too loose."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Actually a great medium sized jacket,5,"I was on the fence, expect the worst and be very pleasantly surprised. For most this will be a light jacket but I am a biker and I ride all year round and through Donner Pass on 80. I'm a cold weather person and this will be my liner for my leather coat and if actually gets cold enough I got a hoodie to use as a liner for this awesome friggen jacket. So far fit and finish is perfect. I'm  5'6"" 164 and it fits my shoulders and arm length it is right at the border for me and I could have gotten a Large and been just as happy. But my chest, neck and shoulders from work are a bit on the large size, if you work out with weights you'd better go large with out question but then you probably already know that. Very nice buttons feel solid to me yes the zipper is on the wrong side I guess  but I could give a rats rear end. Yes I strain to be polite and why I don't this much."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Buttons have already come off after wearing once,1,"Bought this for my 20 year old son. The color and fit were fine. What I am disappointed about was he wore it once for about 2 hours to run errands and a whole button and a half has already fallen off. It wasn’t from pulling it unbuttoned because he didn’t even have it snapped. This is just frustrating and disappointing! I know that ordering clothing online can really be hit-or-miss, but this is just frustrating. You might want to think about some quality control..."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Absolutely not what is advertised,1,Absolutely not what was ordered the pictures show a nice military style jacket what came was this super thin long sleeve shirt
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Fit issues explained, and some other impressions",4,"I am 5’9”, 180 pounds. Having tried the size L on, I now better understand the irregularities in sizing people are raising. For a jacket that seems inspired by the jackets worn by paratroopers in WWII, this fits a little more like an “Ike” jacket, with the size large hitting me pretty much right at the hip. I could have sized up for a more authentic-feeling torso length and a bit more room in the chest, but then the arm length would have been too long. So it’s simply a matter of proportion - this doesn’t have the cut of a true “field jacket.”Material is a little lighter than I would have guessed from earlier reviews - definitely not cut out for winter wear here in Vermont. A good late-spring jacket for this climate.One peculiarity of note: the zipper is on the left, like in an American women’s coat, though the flap covering the zipper is also on the left side. This isn’t terribly important, but it does mean you will probably need two hands to zip.Overall, it’s a nice-looking jacket, clearly inspired by - but not intended as a replica of - military uniforms of the mid-20th century. If you are looking for a fairly accurate knock-off of an issued field jacket, this isn’t it. If you want something that feels like an updated cousin of that jacket, and you are okay with the few issues above, this fits the bill."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Arrived with a hole in the back.,3,"There is a seam across the back that was not sown properly leaving an inch hole in the middle of the back. I elected to sew it rather than send it back. I'm 5'11"" 180lb and the large was a little too roomy. The oddest thing is the left handed zipper. I might get used to it but for now zipping takes more attention. The snap buttons have two protrusions on the side you press your thump against (not smooth). This gives the sensation, I'm pressing on the wrong side of the snap button.  The jacket looks as expected. The lapel zippers actually do have pockets which was a nice surprise. I hate fake zippers to nowhere."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Fits good, looks great!",5,"I usually wear a large but I got XL because I plan to wear a tactical fleece hooded jacket under it.  These run true to size and the XL is a bit big on me so I very carefully washed and dried it (less than 10 min in dryer) and it shrank.  It's perfect but I mainly mention this to let you all know that this will shrink!!  All in all I really like this jacket, It's pretty sharp looking and goes well with my coyote brown fleece, the coat alone is not real heavy.  On mine the zippers are real pockets, about big enough for a smart phone."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Good quality, fits well",5,"This jacket is very comfortable, it has plenty of pockets. It's a little baggy, but that's the way I wanted it to be. I bought another jacket that fits more slim. there are a couple of fake pockets that I was a little disappointed with. I thought they were real in the photo, but I didn't really read the description, so it's probably my fault. Either way the jackets are still good, I like the way they feel and look. I'm keeping this one for more of a dress jacket. The other one I'm using more for work, or times when I'm not worried about it possibly getting dirty. No need to post pictures, it's exactly what the page shows"
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Different than unexpected but a good purchase,4,"First I'll mention this isn't made in the US therefore the zipper is on the left however it's not a women's cut as many Americans think. The zipper on the right for men is just a US thing.Got it to replace a similar style jacket for fall and is warm enough for that purpose (I live in Northern Maine)I got the xl and fits pretty close to what I expected. It pulls just a bit around my shoulders if I say hug someone, but my spine is curved and tends to add extra width so it fits as it should for the size.Biggest draw back is the side pockets are shallow so can't really put much in there without risk of falling out. Everything else is fine. I did think it was more of a windbreaker but it's closer to denim.Goes down to waist so wearing a shirt that can be tucked in but isn't will show.Would recommend!"
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Very nice quality,5,"I am 5'10"" and weight 240 and I ordered a 3x to make sure it was going to be big enough since most of the time things seem to run small.  This jacket however, seems to be made to fit us Americans.  I can wear a hooded sweatshirt under it and still feel fine.  For just normal cool weather with just a shirt I could have ordered a 2X and it would have fit just fine.  Yes the zipper is on the wrong side for a men's jacket, but I am a man and I can adapt just fine.  I think it is a good value and recommend it."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Not men’s jacket.,1,I ordered xtra large because that’s the size I’ve been for a long time. It fits just a little snug across the chest. Otherwise I’m very happy with the material and weight. I would be able to wear this while driving several hours.Update I found that the zipper and flap is on the female side. Not a mans jacket!Update: jacket is a women’s not men’s. Zipper is on the wrong side.
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Size too big,1,"I thought I did my measurements right but I guess not. I ordered a M but it was way too big to I replaced it with a S. I guess a size S was better but it seemed still too big. I guess it wasn't made to fit the body outline of an Asian physique. I'm 136 lbs and 5'5. When I put on the small. It look really baggy, the sleeve around the arm just flapping.. I had other cargo jackets for example ""Superdry size M"" and it wrap great around my body and arms. So how does my previous jacket from Superdry size M which was a great fit so much different from this Eklentson in size S?"
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Isn't as good as the pictures are,3,"first off I may not have found the package if they hadn't sent a picture of where it was at. Second reading most of the reviews before I bought mine I decided to go with the xl size, too big all around the waist end comes down past my pants pockets, waist and chest much too baggy. and third it zips up as for a woman's coat (isn't there two sexes I china). and last the pictures you're looking at makes it look real nice, it's okay not real good. I keep it if for no other reason it'll make a good work jacket."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,My favorite Jacket for fall,5,"Fits me perfectly. I am 5'10, 160lbs and a 30inch waist and ordered a medium if that helpsThe length of the jacket is great, i wish the sleeves were a touch longer but it is great.It is also warmer than I expected. I bought for fall season here but I feel like I could wear a fleece or sweatshirt under it to make it be warm down into the 30F range.Also seems like good quality and makes me look cooler than I actually am. I get invited to a lot more parties when I wear this jacket. Love it!"
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Sharp looking, comfortable jacket",5,"I ordered an XL and it fit me exactly as I wanted it to.  I'm 6'2"" 200#, with long arms.  The sleeves go just beyond my wrist bone and the shoulders are roomy enough to let me cross my arms very comfortably.  I have a 36"" waist (no beer belly) and the knitted rib hem closes up fairly tight around me. Quality is very good - I really like the cotton shell and the metal zippers.  It's not super warm, but it's a good spring/fall jacket and a sweater fits under it very well.  Very pleased with this purchase."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Cool,4,"EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Lightweight Multi Pockets Zip Front Stand Collar Military Jackets Windbreaker: Unique, masculine, military somewhat but since dark blue, not to Army looking. Stylish, not for winter, but thin- so better for Spring or Fall.  Very light weight, but tough. Love the many pockets and that hands can go in when walking, standing for hand warmth. Fits a wee but tight so I ordered one extra size up. I normally wear a L, but I ordered XL and after washing in machine, it fits perfect.  Wish they had a second version for winter, thicker and or a water repellent version."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Good Buy,4,"This jacket is great! I needed a black jacket for my job and this works perfect. Had a lot of pockets and is light weight.The one thing I don't like, is that when I washed it, I can see all these fuzziness and lint stuck to it and it won't come off...also seems to pill easily.But other than that it's a good jacket.So I'm a female, 5'8"", 155lbs and the small is still a bit big on me."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Great looking jacket, at an affordable price",5,"The material quality and overall construction is great. The zippers and buttons work well. This jacket is heavier than a wind breaker, but not heavy enough on its own for snow. I put the jacket size as running slightly small due to the chest sizing. It's probably just me, but i found the jacket a little tight in the shoulders when reaching. I do have relatively broad shoulders. I wear a size XL t-shirt and got a size XL jacket. I dont think going up to XXL would help, as the rest of the jacket fitment is great. I would buy this jacket again."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Runs long, fits perfectly otherwise",5,"This was a gift. The recipient loves the jacket and it looks sharp on him. The fit is perfect except it's too long for an average sized man (5'11""); we thought it would sit at the waist but it hits at upper thigh. The detail and workmanship are top quality, the fabric is sturdy. The zipper, as the seller noted, is on the opposite side from what American men are used to, but that's not a defect or an inconvenience. The price was very reasonable for such a quality garment."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Nice build, but too small. Serious shrinkage after 1st wash.",2,"Very well built, little small, sleeze length is short for the size. After 1st wash shrunk at least a size and a half. Now way too small to wear."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Zipper on the left (like a ladies jacket),3,"Light weight jacket. See customer photos, they give you a better idea how this jacket will fit. The fit is more like how a shirt would fit, not loose. It is a nice jacket. It is just not a heavy jacket. The weight is more like a denim jacket. Also does zip from the left. Unusual for a man’s jacket."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,It's an ok Jacket (small size),4,"The material looks like carhart, but a little softer.I've got the small size, and it fits just right, but if I get a hoodie under than it's tight in the upper side. I got the brown color, but it doesn't look like in the picture, in the pictures looks way nicer than it is.I don't regret getting it, but it doesn't have the wow factor like I was hoping."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Seaming came apart.,1,"I really liked the style and the look of the jacket however, after only 2 weeks of wearing it the seaming began to come apart and I now have a hole in two separate places. On the sleeve and the hole. Though it looks good, I must say that its low quality."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Looks completely different.,1,Looks really good on the picture but is another thing when is on your hands lol poor quality and size is a little bit bigger and looks different. 👎
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Pretty good quality for the price!,5,I had been looking at similar jackets in stores and didn't really wanna pay over 100 dollars for one...So I rolled the dice on this one on Amazon and was pleasantly surprised! Just as nice as all the ones I passed on at the stores! Definitely will get good use out of this jacket!
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Nice style, but questionable quality.",3,"there's a pocket on the inside of the jacket, as well as various pockets on the outside. The inside pocket, however, fell apart before a single wash. It seems the stitching was incomplete on this particular jacket. Without this defect, the jacket would be 5 stars, as I've yet to find another issue in having it since the beginning of September. It acts as a windbreaker and is very warm, and I like that there's no breeze coming in through my sleeves or bottom of the jacket."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Awesome Jacket, just like new after a year later",5,"I have had this jacket for months, I have even put some iron on patches on it and it has held up just fine. I ordered my own size (large) and it fit just as expected. I would have to say this is one of the best amazon purchases I have ever made. I have tried on other name brand jackets and I would say they feel so much cheaper than this one for a marked up price. Overall, this is the best jacket I've ever owned, I would reccomend 100%.Edit: after more than a year the jacket still fits fine, the zippers work perfectly, and there are no signs of wear and tear. Would rate 10 stars if I could"
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,IMPRESSIVE QUALITY.  EXCELLENT STYLE!,5,"I ordered this jacket 1-size larger due to several posts.  It was too large, however I was impressed with its style and quality.  I sent the larger oversized jacket back, and reordered it to my normal size.  It fit perfectly!  Well made, stylish and I love the length!  Would highly recommend!"
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Sloppy sewing, liner separating from seam",3,"Worn casually maybe 20 times, not any reason to split open. If you look you can see where the sewing actually missed the liner entirely missing the material.  Not acceptable."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Wrong side for the zipper,3,"Great jacket, good color, too long for a bomber jacket,  too loose fitting, good quality, comfortable but I sent it back because the zipper is on the wrong side, it zips like a woman's jacket, not cool.  Otherwise I would have kept it."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Great buy - Fast Devilery,5,Bought it for my 14 year old and he loves it.  We received it sooner that we has been told at time of purchase.  The stitching was superb and the details were better than I expected.  Well made.
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Pretty Nice Jacket,4,The jacket is pretty nice. I would recommend getting a size larger then you usually take as it runs small. The one thing I don't like is the zipper and snaps work from the left instead of the right like most men's garments. If it was the correct way I might have given it 5 stars.
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Solid quality, fits to size.",5,Recently ordered this jacket for myself.  I'm 5'9 175.  The reviews and description led me to believe these coats run small so I went ahead and got a large.  I really think I should have got a medium.  The large fits with enough room for layering when it gets colder so I plan on keeping the slightly larger than needed version.  Highly recommend!
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Very good jacket for the money, just order a size larger than you normally wear",5,Jacket is well made and nice looking.  Just make sure you order a size larger than you normally wear because the size shown on the ordering chart is smaller than you would think.  I normally wear size XL but for this jacket I needed a XXL size which fits just right.
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Very Good Field Jacket,5,"I am a landscape photographer and I do not carry backpacks. I travel light with no more than three lenses. This jacket perfectly met my needs. It is a good weight for warmth without the bulk. The pockets are plentiful, the right size for glasses, filters, and a lens or two."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,watch out for return shipping.,2,"not as expected. Yes, did zip on wrong side but I have another jacket like that and it's ok. But I decided to return for refund and would have been required to ship back to China (where it's made) at a cost of $45. Not expecting that.So I donated to clothing bin."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Nice Jacket,5,I wanted a military type jacket as I liked the one I was issued while in the military.Its not exactly  the same as there does not appear to have buttons for a colder weather liner but that is no big deal to me. Jacket is perfect by itself but if your going to Alaska I Would layer it with long johns. I may buy another one if they come in camo.
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,very nice!,5,"i have a really hard time buying on line but this time i hit the jack pot,im 5'11 260 lbs and i ordered 2xl it fits perfect! no lie! i cant believe it! it looks sharp too. and for 50 bucks you cant go wrong"
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Good quality,4,"This coat seems very well made so far (have had it a couple of days now).The length is great, but the shoulders and chest are a little bit loose.I purchased a 2xl based on the seller's size chart, because I'm a pretty big guy (6'5"", and about 260lbs.)I think the XL would have been a more tailored fit, but I don't mind it being baggy, so I'll just keep the one I have now."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,A little too much slack in arms,5,"Nice jacket but a little too light, this wouldn't be my first choice for long term use in the cold/snow. The fit, overall was fine except for the sleeves. Also, beware the buttons. They're heavy and weird, and the jackets a little too flashy for my taste honestly."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,High quality,4,"It is a very high quality jacket for the money. The only drawback is that the zipper zips on the wrong side, what is usually considered the side for ladies. At least in my generation."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Zipper pull tag is on the left,4,"Jacket fit prefect as well sung fit..the only catch. The zipper pull tag is on the left. Instead on the right. I wonder if jacket they selling is woman.  Because,  my girlfriend stated all buttons and zipper tag are on the left."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Was shipped from China, but did get in Michigan in about two weeks.",5,"Fit and quality were very nice. I bought an XL, I am 5 foot ten 190lbs broad shouldered with a 34 inch waist and it fits me quit well if that helps anyone. Has a left hand zipper that seems a little funky when your used to right handed, but I can live with that.  Material is more like Carhart. Not for artic cold but will be great for fall/spring temps or shorter trips out in the cold. Pretty happy with it for the price though.."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Fits well after a wash,5,"When delivered this jacket was quite stiff and didn't really fit well.  After a spin through the wash it loosened up and fits quite nicely now.  I'm a physically fit person so it's a benefit for me, but the jacket is snug around the midsection, so not sure I would recommend if you've got a belly to accommodate."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Nice jacket of you like the style.,4,"Ordered grey but it is more a dark brown. Other reviewers noted the same thing. Rated thin because it is advertised as lightweight which it is.Like this jacket though.Good fit. One odd thing: zipper is on the left, typical of women's clothes."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Great look and style, not meant for cold days.",5,"Loved the way it looked and it fit to my surprise. I thought it would be a bit too large but, I got it in XL and it fit me. I’m a 5’8 healthy kind of guy and it fit me. I would say, not the best for windy nights in the desert. Pro tip, put a fluffy jacket underneath preferably one with a hood and you’ll do fine."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,You get what you pay for,2,"Cheaply made material, with little insulating factor.  Doesn’t quite look like what was in the picture. The material is very thin and doesn’t keep you warm. The only positive is that it fits well."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Great Light weight jacket for chilly to fair weather,5,This is a nice jacket for weather for those days where it's too cold to go without a jacket but not cold enough for something heavier. My husband also gets hot under most jackets but he loves this one
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,"Very good quality, reasonably priced.",5,This jacket fit perfectly. I ordered one size larger (XL) than my normal size (L) per other reviews. This is a great coat with the cuffs and waist that keep the cold out. This jacket looks great with plenty of pockets (some with zippers and some with flaps). There's an inside pocket that comfortably holds a smart phone. I am very pleased with this jacket as it's very reasonably priced with very good quality.
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Worthwhile,5,"This jacket is quite nice! It is light weight yet very warm. I was pleasantly surprised. The fit is great and stylish. It is probably not going to last five years, but a couple anyway. 5'4"" 130 lbs ordered a large. Fits a bit loose, but that's how I like it. Patches in the photo are my own additions."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Surprising Decent Jacket,4,"I went in not expecting too much from this jacket, and at first, was underwhelmed. The front pocket interior lining is weak, and started ripping on the first day.But since then, I've had zero problems with the coat. It looks nice, fits my somewhat  burley build well, and works for what I need it too. Asides from the pocket lining, I've had absolutely zero problems with this product, and have started wearing it almost daily."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Not a flattering silhouette,3,"The pic of the jacket makes it seem to have a rakish, flattering silhouette. It’s actually very straight and fits kind of “sacky”. Too bad I was looking forward to liking it."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Nice Jacket,5,Got this as a gift for my tall and slender fit son.  He loves it and it looks great to layer .  Awesome purchase for the price too.  Had to wash it recently and still looks great
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Looks Great but Runs Small,5,I love the way this jacket looks and feels.  It is very well made.  But I would order one size larger than you think you need.  They seem to run a little on the small side.
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Came with hole in it.,2,"I would have given 5 stars but the new jacket I recieved came with a large hole in the left pocket.  I wore it for the first time today, cutting the tag,  and it is past the return date to exchange for another so I am stuck with a ""holy"" jacket. -_-"
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Great jacket,5,Bought it for my grandson. He’s  6’3 and loves it!
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Pleasantly Surprised,4,"I wasn't expecting much with this purchase, but overall it's been a great light jacket. Looks very stylish, works with a lot of outfits, is comfortable and practical. My only knock against quality is that my outside pocket on the left had a small rip in it when it arrived, but it was easy enough to fix. The jacket was a little tight in my shoulders as well, but not enough that it's uncomfortable to wear. Excellent purchase!"
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Great Jacket!,5,"I'm 6'3, 328lbs. I bought 2xl. I need to lose 10-15lbs for it to look/feel they way I want, but I'll be there in now time. Really like the look/feel of this jacket. I'll be waterproofing it for winter!"
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Large fits as expected,5,"Read comments stating it ran small, not the case. Large size fit as expected."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Too small.,1,Jacket is too small and does not match sizing guide.
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Didn't fit as in description,4,"I loved the material this product was made of.  I thought this product was made for winter and it doesn't keep you warm unless you have layers under it.  It also didn't fit as described, it was smaller than expected."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Top-most button came off in wash,3,"Washed my jacket when I got it and the top-right button at the neck came off. True to size, though I got a size too big since I winged it rather than actually measured chest and such. Looks like a good jacket otherwise, but losing a button the day I get the jacket is annoying as can be; not to mention it's one of those metal buttons and not a genuine button, so no sewing back on."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,So smart!,5,"I look so great in this!  It doesn't seem to matter my arms are freakishly short or my belly is the size of a woman's who is in her 14th month of pregnancy, this jacket looks very good on me.  The buttons really sell it!"
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Love it and glad I didn't go with the size chart.,4,I love this jacket. Thankfully I went with my instincts and ignored the sizing charts. Color perfect and it fits perfect. I'm between 5'8 and 5'9 and I weigh a 185 pounds. I ordered a large instead of the medium that the charts suggested.  Go with what you normally wear it'll save ya time. I don't ever give 5 stars cuz nothing and noone is perfect.
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Careful with the Size,1,"I should have fit a large jacket, but the chest was just a hair too tight. I returned it and got the XL and it fit even tighter around the chest the the Large. Very inconsistent construction, so be careful when ordering. I am going with a better brand. (not an ad, so I won't disclose what)"
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,GREAT jacket for the money,5,If you are looking for a winter jacket this is not the one you want. It's not really insulated. It fits really well though and was WAY nicer than I expected.
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Fast become favorite jacket.,5,"Fast become my favorite jacket, fist one i grab nefore going out the door.

EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Great Jacket,5,"I am very satisfied with this jacket.  So far, only problem seems to be the zipper not catching quickly, but I have only tried it on and it remains to be seen if this will be a problem or not.  Jacket looks excellent and has a nice amount of conveniently located pockets."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Order It A Size Bigger,5,"I wear an XL, but I saw that everyone said to get it bigger. I ordered it XXL and it fits perfect. I am 5'9"" and 140lbs."

EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Black Military Jacket,5,"My husband loves this jacket.

EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,very nice for the price,5,"I love this jacket. I love in a fairly warm place, so its perfect for early mornings when its just a little chilly. It is thin, so would not be great if you live in a place with very cold winters. The sizing it a bit off, I normally wear a mens medium, and I ordered a small. Which fits great. The only issue is the sleeves are just slightly too long. But that is most likely due to me having shorter arms and not the jacket itself."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Runs small,4,Jacket looks great but runs smaller than listed. Got a 3XL and it was pretty tight in the shoulders and waist. Not meant for broad frames
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,Not true to size,3,"Made for Lilliputians I suspect, not earthlings. Too tight. Way off."
EKLENTSON Men's Cotton Military Jackets Casual Outdoor Coat Windbreaker Jacket Khaki,A bit snug below,5,"Tight around the waist, but it might stretch anyway. Nice thick outer shell!  Bet it’ll even keep ya dry."

BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Hear me out... NOT Breathable at ALL,3,Okay so - I love the vibrant color of this jacket (main reason I got it) as I run early morning and hadn’t found anything as bright to protect me from cars. I’ve been using this in about 20°-30° F weather over a thermal base layer when I run and this thing is NOT breathable like the seller claims. I barely sweat on a light jog in this low of temperatures and the sweat literally pools into beads on the inside of the coat and when you take it off there is an entire layer of slick moisture lining the whole inside of the jacket.I wanted to love this thing so badly... :(
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Great value product,5,"I have two types of wind breaker jackets.  An Asics brand that was way to expensive but does the job and an Under Armor that I got as a Christmas present several years ago.  When it's cold outside I use these wind breakers on every run and even though they are thin I layer up.  As I have been running more lately and it's cold outside I was looking for one more jacket that I could because some days I've used the two and they are in the laundry.  This was well worth the purchase.  I've bought a lot of product from runningwarehouse.com.  You can find good deals on shoes when they go on sale and sometimes on clothing.  I was looking at Brookes, Nike jackets on sale for $50 to $60 but thought I would look at Amazon.  I have two pairs of BaLeaf 2 in 1 shorts and a shirt.  Those have been great products for the price and these is no different.  I've been on one run it was about 29 degrees outside and I was layered up good to keep warm.  It does exceptionally well to break the wind and I'm sure it will do good to shed water since it's a thicker material than my Asics and UA jackets.  This is waterproof were those are not.  The material seems durable and zippers seem solid too.  Time will tell if they hold up but just compared to quality of my other two jackets and how much I've used those I think this will work out and last just as long.  This price is the kicker.  Like I said compared to other name brands this is well worth the money.  I'll try and update after a few more uses but so far I would highly recommend this product."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Trust on Belaf.,5,"Love it 👍🏻 I put it on to ride bike, while outside the temperature was 46 degrees and I was warm the entire ride."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Fit was just right for my size.,5,"I use this product to keep me somewhat warm in the morning when I ride my road bike. It sure helps in weathering the cool breeze and by the time I'm done with my ride I have built up some sweat. I haven't really tried its water resistance as it hasn't been raining here lately in Southern California. I never ride in the rain anyway- too dangerous with those crazy drivers out there. I will attempt to wear this when it starts raining outside when I'm up and about. Love the multiple pockets and the luminous color.MY SUGGESTIONS TOWARDS THIS PRODUCT-1. Perhaps it would be nice if the wrist elastic band had a velcro adjustment on it to have the option of having to wear it loose or tight.2. Secondly, I wish the hood could be tucked into a zippered compartment by the collar.Aside from those two options I'm really happy with this product."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Dry - but warm. Zipper needs improvement.,3,This seems to do a good jobs of keeping the water out. But it's definitely not breathable. I would not want to wear this in weather above 60 degrees. It just turns into a sweat box. It's like wearing a rubber balloon.It might keep the rain out but you'll be covered in your own sweat.My other issue is the main front zipper. It loves to get caught in the jacket fabric.Other then that it's a nice jacket. The hood stays in place nicely and keeps the water off. Pockets are a nice size.
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Tight Fitting,4,I ordered this jacket and it came too tight for me. Consider moving up one size. Delivery time was awesome. Material seemed  of good quality and met my expectations. Sizing was the only issue and it needed to go back.
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Excercise before sunrise? You need this coat.,5,I love the high visibility color and reflective strips. The back bottom hem has a wide rubbery texture to prevent the coat from riding up. The pockets all zip. I have wide shoulders and the size I ordered is a little tighter through the shoulders than I prefer. Great product.
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Too Small and Like a Suana!,1,"I wear an XL, but this product is way to small and tight, especially through the shoulders and chest.  Also, in the pictures of the product, it appears to have a mesh interior lining, but it is simply a print, not a mesh lining. As you perspire with increased activity, the jacket is like being in a suana as the moisture is trapped between the skin and the jacket.  I was so uncomfortable that I did not wear it long enough to comment on its ability to repel rain.  I would have to assume that it was water repellant since I felt like I was just wearing a rubber jacket. I am returning the jacket for a refund."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Excellent biking outerwear layer.,5,"Excellent jacket for being visual riding a bike.  Pockets are very functional.I opred not to rank ""warmth"" as thats because its a wind break not a warmth-providing jacket.Think layers but note it does provide a degree of warmth as its got a moisture barrier indise and out so it doesnt ""breath"".  Add a layer of cotton between body and jacket to wisk away moisture."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Best light outdoor jacket I have,5,"Love the fit and pockets...2 large inner vest pockets (without a zipper) and the others have zippers.  There is a big back pocket, a side chest pocket, 2 hand pockets.  There is elastic at the bottom hem and around the hood.  There’s reflective tape on front and back.  I live in FL and it gets HOT.  But there is a vent in the back too.  And the back has a strip of silicone so the back doesn’t ride-up.  This the best outdoor jacket/rain jacket I have.  The jacket is shorter than I expected, I am 5’7 and ordered a S.  I usually don’t go on about products or show pictures, but the jacket is way better than I expected it would be for the price.I wear it on trips to the store, bike rides, walks, runs.  The bright green one is really super visible."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Rain Coat,5,It is water resistant. I would not recommend wearing it when it is not raining.
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Great Jacket NOT TRUE TO SIZE FOR WESTERN BODIES,3,"Great jacket, unfortunately too small. I intended for this jacket to be worn over 1 or 2 insulating layers for winter riding up here in Washington. Description says fits true to size. Ordered men’s large. Like so many of these items made in China, regardless of brand, they too often run very small. Large size is too tight in shoulders with only a t-shirt on. I am 6ft 190#. I wear a 44 inch suit jacket. Men’s large jackets and shirts are my usual, if properly sized for western bodies. I am sending it back and have already reordered in a XXL . I hope this gives me the room to wear base layers underneath as originally intended. I will update after I receive it."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Poor Quality,1,"Sleeved ripped at the seam at two months and about ten uses. Right after the return window closed, of course. The jacket is waterproof, somewhat breathable, not warm, highly visible, and has good pockets, but the poor quality is not worth the price."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Junk flimsy material rips easily,1,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   Seriously? I would have though for an almost $50 jacket that this would have been more stable and not as cheaply made as it was. I would never order this again because the price is outrageous for the poor quality it is. I have not even had this jacket a few months and one side of the pockets the zipper is already broke off plus there are holes already. I am very disappointed in this product. Complete junk for the price I've paid I'm better off getting a heavier duty bomber jacket than this. Never again!"
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Great Warmth for the Weight but a tad snug,4,"I bike commute every day in all weather and do fun rides most weekends. I got this a few weeks ago to use as my spring/fall jacket, for days where I absolutely need a jacket in the morning, but may be riding home in much warmer weather in the late afternoon and don't want to have to carry a heavy, bulky coat on my bike.  So far this works very well for that role.*** THE GOOD: **** The warmth provided for a jacket this light is pretty striking. It just has a shell and a thin liner sewn in -- it is very light. Yet this morning my commute was just below freezing and this jacket kept me warm enough.* Adequate pockets. There are two front pockets for keeping my gloves in, an upper front pocket for keeping my mask and a spare gaiter in and a more spacious rear pocket that I haven't used yet, but has enough space for my phone, my wallet, and my keys with a bit of room left over.* The hood can be worn under my bike helmet. It does take a bit of adjustment to get right, but it can keep the rain off my head without blocking my visibility.* The color is bright and high visibility, which is useful as the time change means it's now dark when I ride in the mornings.* So far it has kept me dry riding in early spring rains. Although I have only tested this on a fairly short commutes to date.*** THE NOT SO GOOD: **** I'm currently at a ""XL is too tight, XXL is too loose"" weight. Since this will often be an overlayer, I ordered a double X to leave some room. And while it does fit, it is a lot more snug that any other double X jacket or shirt I own - it's more of an X and a Half Large than a Two X Large.  If you are larger and unsure of sizes, you definitely want to round up to the next size.* The zipper is a little sticky. It can be hard to work with one hand -- which is a significant downside for riding routes with varying hills and winds.* There is no compartment,  nor zipper, nor velcro closure for folding the hood in. You can wear the hood, tuck the hood annoyingly behind your neck or deploy it as a drag chute. This seems an oversight for a *cycling* jacket.* I still haven't managed to actually fold this jacket into its own back pocket for storage and transport. The procedure is not as trivial as the images here make it seem. Now my commuter bike has racks and bags attached and this is light and small enough to just tuck in or tie it off multiple places on my bike so I haven't tried all that hard to make this feature work."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,A bicyclist ‘s opinion5,3,"I bicycle daily in the Northwest, that requires layering. I find the jacket, in large, is more like a medium, and the sleeve diameter makes Inserting arms with layers ( long sleeve and fleece, cotton), difficult. Also, the zipper is rather dainty with no exterior snaps, and the hood has no pocket, just deployed all the time. This is not only annoying, it can interfere with peripheral vision. I like the vivid color and material, and it is a pretty good windbreaker with the high collar. All in all, my impression is that it could have been designed better however."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Not very breathable....Super bright.,4,"This jacket is not very breathable. It was comfortable for running in 30 degree weather with a light layer but it was moist inside when I got home. The pockets are made of the same material and would be better if they were netting so you could open them up for added breathing. That said, it’s a great value for the price and works well for Utah winter running. SUPER BRIGHT."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,2 flaws prevent this from being a rated 5 jacket,3,"I wanted to love this jacket and the color (light gray) and styling were spot on for me. But there are 2 major flaws that I couldn't get over.Hood (wind airbrake!)This thing just flaps around like anything when you're running and will slow you down as it acts like a airbrake on a plane. I wish they made some way to secure it in either a rolled-up way or so it attaches to the jacket so as to prevent it from flapping around like a palm tree in a hurricane. I had some limited success by tucking inside but it still tries to come back out like a creature burrowing out from a hole.Back zipper compartmentI love the placement of this and his gets rid of thing hindering your legs if you're either running or biking BUT .. this zipper always gets stuck with the little flap that runs along the top of the zipper that prevents water from getting into the pocket.  Oh, I've lost count of the number of times I'm struggling to get stuff out while running and realizing the stupid zipper has gotten stuck again.I still like the jacket a lot but have had to adjust to the 2 gripes above which is a little annoying."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Do NOT waste your money,1,"This jacket is a nice weight, but it is terrible to wear.  You will end up WET with sweat.  It makes you sweat and it sticks to you.  If you are wanting a hi viz jacket for cycling, don't get this one. Get one that is just a windbreaker.  This one is waterproof, but from the inside out.  I got it for my husband and he hates it because it makes him sweat so much, even when it's cool in the early mornings."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,It's a great rain jacket,4,"I ran in this when it was dark and changing between rain, snow and sleet.  It kept me dry and I had the hood up with a ball cap underneath to keep the precipitation out of my eyes.  It kept my ears warm and dry.  I love the reflective tape on the shoulders and the phone pocket on the left breast side.  All zippers seem great.  I wish it had more vents built in, particularly under the arms.  When I walked into the garage and extended my arms straight down, the collected sweat ran out the sleeve.  It was cold.  I'd pay more for better ventilation.  That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5"
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Great value for its intended use,5,"My running gear is deep with warm and wicking layers, but I needed a windbreaking layer that would keep rain, sleet, snow and slop out. I wanted improved nighttime visibility too. I didn't want to spend over a hundred bucks on something to do this, as many sport-specific items would suggest. The thought of paying twice for abusive conditions makes workouts less likely to happen.I took the chance on this one. It did the trick, and better than I expected. Material seems lightweight but more durable than expected. Seams and zippers are well sealed, and the pockets are ample and in all of the right places. Wind and wet stuff didn't get through at all on my first two uses. It's not a warm layer, so don't mistake that, but it Ventilation is OK, but I've never known that to be different on good foul weather outer layers. The combination of the bright but not obnoxious orange color and the reflective patches made me feel as confident in my neighborhood on a nighttime run as my reflective bib.Will I suggest using this for BQ altitude training through the Himalayas? Will it help me break a 2:00 marathon? Both are unlikely. Will it keep me dry, warmer, and visible to my neighbors on evening runs? Yep, and it has."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Keeps you dry. What else do you need?,5,"We got a two of these for a couple trips we have this summer. The first one was a road tip up to Seattle. They fit nicely in our bag all folded up. In Portland it rained a bit. So we pulled these out and wandered around town. Kept us dry. It was June, so not very cold. And it was breathable. Warm, but not hot. When we got back in the car we just shook them off and they were already dry.Folding it into a pouch is very easy and quick. And it fits into a small backpack and doesn’t take up the entire pack. Still room for water bottle, selfie stick 😂 and a few other things.I would recommend this jacket. It’s light, breathable, and most importantly. It kept us dry in our adventure.I am 6 feet about 175 and the xl fit well. I could have had a hoody on under if needed. And most importantly, the arms were long enough. The hood has a little bill on it and kept the rain off my face. Plus it’s big enough it went over my hat fine."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Nice jacket,4,"I like this jacket.  Being waterproof, though, it does hold in the heat.  This would be very good on a cold day, but when I was riding in 63 F weather, I actually got too warm.  I sweat through my jersey!  So, I recommend this more for temps below 60 F.  If riding in wet weather, I'm sure I'll be happy to be wearing this.  I also like that it has a lot of pockets!  Good to have on a long ride."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,I need something that is truely waterproof,5,"Nothing water resistant/proof is breathable and nothing breathable is water resistant for long. And I need waterproof for those cold and/or rainy days. I'm American large and bought 3XL for three reasons. 1. My large amd the manufacturer large probably isn't the same. 2. I need the extra space inside to layer up for the winter months. 3. Even if my large and their large is the same, coats in general are box shaped. I need sleeves that will cover my wrist plus cover and go below my belt line."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Measurements don't make sense.,2,"5'10"", 145lb. Athletic build.40 chest/ 32 Waist/ 35 HipsOrdered a Medium size in teal color.The jacket fits nice and contoured on the hips. The bottom sits at my hips/ the rear hem sits just below hips/ the sleeves are a bit baggy.The chest area is about 4"" too wide. I don't know anyone with dimensions like this. IMO Not for cycling since (ideally) you want a contoured fit all the way around. I imagine hitting a headwind or even side wind and parachuting off of my bike with this jacket (exaggeration). Maybe I got the one garment that creeped past the quality inspection.I suspect that a Small size would be too short and still have the baggy chest.Had to return."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Great Value in a Rain Jacket!,4,"The key word for this jacket is waterproof. This mean it keeps the water out but depending on your activity level, it will keep the sweat in. I’m sure it breathes but even a brisk 3 mile walk in the rain leaves me a bit soggy. There is a back vent but think it will be more beneficial when riding on my bike. I ordered ‘red’ but it’s more orange than red.  But I still like the Hi-Viz color.That said I love everything else about the jacket. Pockets galore, and waterproof zippers!  Love the visor on the hood which keeps the rain off my glasses. Comfortable fit (XL) with room for a t-shirt and sweater+ for warmth.WELL WORTH THE MONEY!"
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Saved me from roadrash,5,"This jacket was my favorite running/biking jacket.....until the crash.Someone crashed into me with a bike while I was riding my mountainboard.....and it was a violent and ferocious collision.This thing saved my back from some SEVERE road rash.I was just wearing this jacket and a normal t-shirt... this jacket took all the abuse. Of course, the jacket is now dead, there is a 12""×6"" hole in the back where I painted the road with flourescent green fabric..... but I will definitely take it.I did not expect this jacket to hold up to such a vicious beating.....but I am sure glad I was wearing it that day.If I could give more than 5 stars, I would."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,A good value for the mone,4,"I am very satisfied with this product. It breaks the wind and repels rain as advertised, which is exactly what I wanted.  Some reviews I read prior to purchasing the jacket seemed to indicate it provided a lot of warmth.  I took this claim with a grain of sand, and I was right to do so.  The jacket is way too light to provide much warmth, but this makes it very wearable when running in cool Spring or Autumn weather in the rain.  The jacket is acceptable in cold weather,, provided you wear adequate thermals underneath. Pockets are really good; can easily carry a cell phone, wallet, and keys.  The zipper looks a bit flimsy, but so far, no problems.  This is exactly the jacket I wanted at a very reasonable price."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Poor workmanship,1,"First time the jacket was worn, the pocket when being opened,  the zipper just fell apart and the hook which held the grasp in place just opened up."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,"Initial zipper was defective, replacement jacket had a good zipper",4,"The jacket seemed to be good quality, except for the zipper. The zipper on the first jacket didn't work at all and a friend of mine had a similar problem but got it working. I sent mine first one back and since there wasn't anything else of this quality or style I ended up ordering it again, this time very pleased. I only wish the quality control was much better, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. I haven't had it in rain yet but it certainly looks like a good material. I normally wear XL and that's what I ordered. Not snug at all. 5'-8"", 200 lbs."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Almost ideal,4,"First off, was looking for a rain proof fitness jacket.  This would likely fit the bill, but decided to return it as it didn't breath well.  So I ended up returning for a couple reasons: 1) seemed shorter in the torso than I wanted, and 2) decided to get a more breathable, non-waterproof jacket.  If I decide to get a water resistance fitness jacket later, I will definitely give this a chance.  Right now, due to wear I live, being around a lot of construction and no ideal routes, I am not going to run in the rain."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Definitely water resistant but not breathable,2,First of all I brought the red jacket and it was a very nice looking red. Kinda like a red orange.  It is definitely water resistant and it fit me perfectly. The only negatives I have is that the hood of the jacket was to big and didn't stay on tight riding my bike.  The hood kept coming off while riding my bike even with me tying it up with the twisties in the front. Like I said it is water resistant tho but omg it is definitely not breathable. I wore my rain jacket on a rainy day and it was only like 65 f degrees it made me feel hot and sweaty and that's something I don't like. Bottom line jacket good water resistant but not breathable. If you don't like to sweat under a jacket this one is not for you.
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,"A great jacket, with a caveat or two.",4,"This jacket does what it says on the tin. It is waterproof and windproof. Do not think you are going to be toasty warm only wearing this, though. You need to layer up if it is cold.It gets a little too warm inside, so expect to sweat if you exert yourself in coolish/warmish weather, just like any rain coat.It fits snug, so size up.I wish the hood could be folded away inside somewhere. Maybe it can and I am missing something, but I have not noticed a pocket for it. That is what is holding it back from 5 stars."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Not for exercise,1,"The jacket is waterproof, but is absolutely non breatheable, with no venting. This means that as soon as you work up a sweat with biking or running, you overheat, get drenched in sweat, and have to unzip it. Should be called and sold as a basic raincoat for walking."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Top Quality,5,"Just bought my second jacket- a blue one. Bought the first bright yellow one last summer to use primarily as an ""over jacket"" for walking. As I walk  mostly on country roads, it is much safer to be seen by distracted drivers. Wore the jacket for every walk, every day through the New England winter. I really could not be happier with the performance. The jacket is made with quality materials. It actually is waterproof AND wind resistant. I make use of all the pockets for gloves and sunglasses etc. The front top pocket seems perfectly designed for my iPhone so I can listen too podcasts while walking and still hear the traffic for safety. The gathered sleeves keep me warm. The hood sheds the rain away from my face - more good design- and fits snugly and doesn't blow off. Also, I learned that the yellow safety color works well in mall parking lots at night to be visible. Liked it so much, I bought another one to wear when I don't need the ultra-visibility."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,GREAT RAIN JACKET,5,"I walk my dog about 4 miles per day and live in a very wet climate where I face rain, mist, fog and damp conditions daily.  My former rain jacket leaked at the seams so I was always wet even with the jacket on.  But the BALEAF jacket has been totally waterproof so far and even provides some warmth from the wind.  I like the many pockets and the packable pouch in the back that makes it easy to pack and transport.  The high visibility green and reflective seams has been great as it's often dark or foggy when I walk so I'm never worried if a passing car can see me. I ordered a size larger because I like it loose fitting so the fit is perfect for me."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Love it,5,"I keep it in my bag for when I have to work outside while it's raining. The hood falls down when the wind is blowing but the sleeves fit absolutely perfectly. (5'11"" and I got a large). I liked the vibrant highlighter yellow color as it boosts my mood while I'm dealing with flash flood rains while I'm at work. Five stars 🤩"
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Reflective and waterproof material great!,5,"I didn’t review the working out portion because I bought this jacket for my husband who is a truck driver at the ports. I wanted a jacket that would be light weight, flexible and reflective for him while working as it’s a safety concern for employees and reflective safety vests must be worn.He loves this jacket. He says it keeps him warm. It keeps him dry and the reflective material is perfect. He likes that it’s thin so he can wear his safety vest over the jacket. He’s able to move about freely without restriction from the jacket.  So I’m thankful and glad that this product was a great purchase for the working man. Let’s see how long it lasts for him."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,description is misleading!,2,"If this was advertised as a raincoat, I'd give it 4 stars.  Product description says ""24hr breathability"" and ""enhanced breathability"".  This jacket is as breathable as a Hefty bag.  I'm a cyclist, and bought it for long rides.  I wore it my first chilly morning ride, and after warming up, I sweat quite bit.  Sweat literally pooled inside the coat.  When I lowered my hands from the bike, sweat ran out of the sleeves.  This jacket is not appropriate for any athletic activity.  If you just want an inexpensive raincoat, it should do the trick."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,"Good quality, but could be a little thicker for the price.",4,"Looks good, but could be thicker for the money and the zipper is difficult to zip as the flap from the opposite side keeps flipping into the zipper path. Also, the material is NOT breathable. Used this jacket in damp weather and light intermittent rain. When I finished my trail, 4 and 1/2 miles later, my shirt INSIDE the jacket was wetter from sweat than the jacket was on the OUTSIDE from the rain. Maybe I'm expecting too much(?), but it was only 72 degrees outside."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Great jacket for biking during winter.,5,"I was not sure about this Jacket when I received it. I thought that the material is not thick enough. To my surprise, it was pretty warm and blocked the wind during biking. It’s also very light and I can put snacks, car key and wallet in the pockets too. And it fits me perfectly."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,"Great for biking, great visibility",5,"This coat did a great job keeping the cold ocean mist and wind out. This coat is not warm, but wearing it with sweatshirt or long sleeve shirt works like a charm. Great visibility.  I am 6’3” and 195. Size XL gives me room to layer up to stay warm.Very happy with my purchase."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Wonderful Shell,5,I wanted a shell that could wear over layers depending on the weather. I also wanted a color that would be safe and stand out. I found both of these qualities in this jacket. I'm so pleased with it! I'm a small framed female; the small fits me perfectly. The sleves are a lttle long but I like that because I can tuck my hands inside when I'm walking if it gets cold. The eleastic bands on the sleves are tight enough that I can pull them above my wrist and they stay there. I also love all the pockets. Overall it's a great jacket.
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Not a windbreaker,1,This is a raincoat not a windbreaker… It has vents in the back that allow wind in
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Perfect jacket,5,I a woman and I’m 5’6” and weight is 130lbs. I purchased the men’s neon green in small for walking early when it’s still dark. Great jackets!! A little big but this way I can wear a sweatshirt underneath. Great zipper pockets. Very comfortable. I don’t have to fuss with it while I’m walking.
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Well constructed reasonably priced,4,"Pros: waterproof material, main zipper of good quality with waterproof seal along its side.  Very light.  Blocks wind effectively.Cons: material not very breathable.  Vents help but it can get stuffy inside.  Does fold into its pocket as advertised, but can get bulky and material does winkle badly after being stuffed (if you care about that).Overall, I'm pleased with it."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Well made,5,"This jacket is well made and nicely tailored. The inside pockets are a plus. The XL is good for a 6-foot-tall man (around 170 lbs) who's going to wear it over other heavy jackets or sweatshirts. If you're planning to wear it alone, I'd go for the L size instead."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Sizing was way off so item returned,2,"I’m 6’3 255 lbs so an XXL should fit with no problems, right? This jacket hung right at the belt line (too short) and has this waterproofing liner (like a dry cleaning bag material) that would stick to your skin and not allow the jacket to properly fit (or breathe). The jacket seemed well made with complete stitching and no hanging threads. The sizing was way off so this item was as returned."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,"The fit is a little weird (not ""athletic"") but a great biking jacket for the price",5,"I can't testify to the waterproofness.  We really don't have much rain here.  It does, however, provided excellent wind resistance and excellent visibility.  The fit is not typical for bike clothing.  It has too much room in the torso, which would lend itself to wearing layers underneath.  The overall quality is not top notch, but the price point makes that okay.  Great value."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Great for the value,5,"This jacket is very bright in the yellow color. I love the back air vent and the reflective stripes. We are in a major drought so I haven't had a chance to wear this in the rain yet, so I can't tell whether or not it's actually water proof but it appears like it would be. I wish it had a loop to hang the jacket up on a hook. The adjustable hood leaves something to be desired too but this jacket is lots cheaper than most rain gear."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Works great for runners - Right price and was exactly what the disruption said,5,Purchased it for running (cross country on rural roads) The jacket is bright so I don't worry about cars. As a rain coat for runners it works great - not to warm (Lets heat out but block wind and rain.I plan to use it as my sailing light rain gear also.
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Almost 2X stated weight!,2,"A fairly nice rain jacket at a reasonable price, and not bad-looking.  BUT, it is MUCH HEAVIER than speciified. I specifically ordered this due to its stated weight of 6.25 oz (looking for a super-light jacket for bikepacking)... but found it actually weighes 11.7 oz. (size M).  I've already got a jacket in that weight range, so this one's going back.  Could've saved me a the trouble of buying & returning it if they'd posted an accurate weight!"
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Decent rain coat by next size up from your usual,4,It keeps you dry but isn’t as “breathable” as expected. Unless it’s a summer down pour you’ll end up more soaked wearing this during a workout. But as a raincoat alone it does what you expect a rain coat to do. Only other issue is the size I wear xl or 2xl shirts but the 2xl jacket was snug to my chest when zipped.
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,"Good, inexpensive windbreaker for Running/Walking",4,"I use this top primarily for walking on the beach.  For the price it is what I expected.  This isn't Gore-Tex, so it doesn't breathe, but it blocks the winds off the ocean and when properly layered, it keeps me warm and works up a good sweat.  It has no warmth by itself, but over a sweatshirt and base layer, it works fine.It does seem to run a bit small, however, so be sure to size up, especially if you're using it as a top layer."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Just as advertised  Very good rain gear.  Especially for cool days,4,"I am 5'11"" and 190, a large is a snug fit under the arms but the sleeves are long enough and it does not ride up my back when walking or bicycling.  Nice that it does not billow out when I'm riding.  Good product competitively priced.  The vent in the back could be larger, I do get heated up on warm days."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Good value,4,After shopping around and shaking my head at up to $200.00 for a rain jacket read the reviews for this & took a chance.

If you sweat, it will stay inside the jacket!",4,Good value for the money; haven't experienced it in rain but expect it to repel water very little (material appears more like a rubber than your fancy stance fabrics).  Wearing it with a medium layer in late September for morning bike commutes in Denver Colorado.  Wrist bands just an elastic.

Quality is insane and on par with if not better than the big brands. Good materials, storage. Functionality, etc. Love the zipper pouch in back and body heat venting. This is an essential layer for winter or wet and wild running. For me, fits true to size (6' and 185lbs, bought a L). If you're on the fence, just pull the trigger, you won't be sorry. One of the best gear purchases for the price that I've made in a minute."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Nice jacket!,5,Haven't worn it in bad weather yet but seems like it would do the job.  Like how it folds into itself to create its own storage bag where you can keep it in a saddle bag or bike rack bag.  Did have a problem with one of the zippers getting caught on itself but was able to replace it with no issues.
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Great lightweight jacket for bike riding!,5,"Super nice, lightweight, well built jacket with lots of zipper pockets.

BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,"Nice jacket, too snug upper back.",5,"I love this lightweight rain jacket with exception to the fit across the upper back.

BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Go up a size if you live colder areas,5,"If you are going to wear it in cold weather and  you have additional layers happening,  you should go a size up.  I am 6'1""  but I ordered XXL and it fits just right over my winter riding/walking  clothes.  If you live  in warmer climes your regular size for a jacket should be fine. over single layer."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,NOT WATERPROOF AT ALL,1,"I'm very disappointed in this purchase.  I was hoping not to be soaked and also sweating my butt off wearing this. It fits nicely,but it's so hot and I walk dogs so I really need a WATERPROOF jacket.  Not worth the money."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,The best add to my cycling outerware,5,"This holds heat in period.

BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,"High quality, some disappointments",4,"Was looking for easy to pack travel rain gear. Video with product seemed to show a small pouch it folded into.  Not the case.  Apparently, it all folds into the back pocket with a bit of turning inside out, haven’t accomplished that yet.  Also the fit tends to be a bit small to order 2 sizes bigger.  Nevertheless it is well constructed with lots of pockets, etc."
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Worth considering,5,I bought x large and it is a little smaller than I’d like but it is winter and I wear a sweatshirt under it usually.

BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,AWESOME!!!,5,I manly use the jacket for rainy days when I go for my walk. Depending on the temperature it would hurt to ware a sweatshirt or a thin layer shirt underneath. I have a 3XL that fits well but I could have gotten a 4XL I like the looseness feel. All in all I love the look and style.A
BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Great product!,5,Great item!I was really impressed by the quality of this windbreaker!Very well made.The only possible downside is that it was a bit too short for me. Maybe by an inch.

It is Not to the point where you need to size up but if your between two sizes I’d recommend going a to the larger size. I am using this for night runs.  It is super reflective and day glow.  You can wear a very thin base layer and this will keep you warm in surprisingly low temperatures.  Not a whole lot of ventilation but you can always zip down a bit and it works.

The sleeves fit well. The body length was short by an inch or so but that was expected since it's a 'big' size.  The phosphorescence is very good which the main reason I bought this. Haven't worn it in the rain. It's works well as a light jacket.

BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Needs to Breath More,4,Being water proof it could use more breathability.

BALEAF Men's Cycling Running Jacket Waterproof Rain Windbreaker Reflective Lightweight Windproof Bike Golf Jacket,Worth It!,5,I LOVE HOW AMAZING IT WORKS!
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Printed Jacket,Bought a men's size because the women's sizes are always too fitted..,4,"When I'm lounging or if it's cold out I don't want a fleece that is so fitted I can't fit anything but a t shirt under it.  I got a men's large knowing it would shrink just a bit.  Put it in the wash and dryer when I got it and it's just big enough. I normally take a Large or X-Large in a Women's size....I love that the fleece is a bit thicker than the run of the mill jackets in the stores.  It's not lined but I don't have any problem getting it on or taking it off.There are nice deep, zippered pockets, an adjustable jacket bottom and elastic cuffs.  The elastic on the cuffs is nice when the arms are just a little long.I also love the colors and pattern of this jacket.  It's not just one color.  I wish it had a couple more pockets but I think I'm going to get many seasons out of this jacket...It may not be warm enough by itself in the Mid-Atlantic winters but it should work to keep me warm for spring, summer nights, fall and most of winter..."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Printed Jacket,really happy this jacket and Coumbia products I have bought in general.  10/10,5,"Jacket looks nice.  Other Columbia jackets have held up well over a period of years too.  I like that this jacket has a pattern and is unique and different to most fleece jackets.  At this price it is a ""Best Buy"", a great value and I would buy again, or trust to buy other Columbia medium weight fleece jackets.  Very happy with this jacket.NOTE - since buying my first Steen Columbia jacket I had to get another one with a different pattern.  I love both of them because they are quick, easy, versatile and comparatively inexpensive.These may not be the best choice for super cold weather, but I start with a Merino Wool undershirt, and then put a long or short sleeved Merino Wool T-Shirt over that.  Then if it is really cold a Wool sweater ... and then my fleece jacket.  I am always warm and I can add or subtract as needed and never need to wear anything stiff or heavy.  It is was sub-zero I would put a down jacket over all of that too!  ;-)One thing I might mention is that these are good to sleep in too if it is a cold night.  If you get overheated in the night the moisture will wick off and you do not wake up drenched in sweat, that is freezing cold.  I can't say enough good things about a company that makes a jacket as reasonable as these.  Maybe - don't change."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Printed Jacket,Great light fleece coat...,5,"Columbia seems to make very good quality coats.  I have a couple ski jackets and a couple fleeces like this gray-blue fleece for $25.00. I just bought. Very nice quality.  I’m 5’9 230 - 37” waist and big shoulders and arms...so I’m husky.  XL fits a little small around my chest and arms but good overall fit.  I love the overall quality.. also, the wind blows right through it..  ...not good for windy cold.  Fuzzy comfort = yes.."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Printed Jacket,Warm and cozy!!,5,"Good looking stylish slim fit jacket. That is Warm and cozy without being bulky or boring. You can layer under a larger jacket or have it be the outer most layer, or just wear and go in slightly cooler weather. This jacket won't disappoint."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Printed Jacket,Great price for a fun pattern fleece,5,"Been watching Yellowstone and the rancher life inspired me to get this southwestern-esque pattern (I know Montana isn't the SW, but still). Like the warmth and quality, feels a bit big for a large though, but luckily early 90s baggy fits are in so you'll be good."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Printed Jacket,Nice to see some variety in my three-season go-to,5,"I've worn these fleeces for years, and was happy to see a patterned version.  With graying hair, my wife is always picking stray hairs off my collar and shoulders.  This design ""hides"" them and I feel less self-conscious about my appearance.  Warm with collar zipped up, cool with jacket unzipped, it's just right for much of the year!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Printed Jacket,Calidad Columbia,5,"La campera muy suave, calentita, un poco más gruesa de lo que esperaba pero bien.

Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Printed Jacket,Very little break-in time,5,"Boots are amazing. Ive been wearing Wolverine Boots for years but these Justins have put an end to that run.

Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Printed Jacket,Superb Fleece Jacket,5,"I have several Columbia full-zip fleece jackets in my closet, but this one is my new favorite.  The size Large fits my 6-foot, 185-lb. body perfectly.  The fleece material is very soft and comfortable against bare skin.  The jacket is lightweight but surprisingly warm.  The fleece material of this garment seems to be a little thicker than my other Columbia fleece jackets.  There are two zippered pockets on the outside that are large enough for a cell phone and other fairly large items.  All zippers operate smoothly.  I love the colors and the interesting print.  I bought this jacket on Amazon for $35 (half price), which I think is a very good buy.  5 stars."

Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Not a bad coat for a few uses and the money.,5,"After reading the reviews, I ended up ordering a XXL.  I am 5-10 and 175 lbs.  The overall fit is as expected after reading everyone's comments.  The arm length is just right.  Its a little tight in the shoulders and I will need to be cautious of moving my arms in the upward position quickly (not to rip a seam).  If you are my size and plan to wear something with any thickness under this, I would size up one more to the triple X.The clasps to close the jacket are really cheap.  The are just hooks.  I will only be wearing this open as a prop, so that didn't matter to me.  It came in a vacuum sealed bag and looked to be too small to be the right item I ordered, but it expands quickly and there was only one minor crease noticeable.  I will let it expand and see if it subsides.Color and is exactly as pictured and looks great.Overall its pretty much what I expected for the price.  I would recommend it, but be cautious on getting the right size.  My jacket size is normally a Med-Large and I should have ordered a XXXL for this one."
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,The jacket is dope,5,This jacket I purchased as a joke for New York Fashion Week. Though it was completely out of my element I received many compliments. I am 511 198 pounds I purchased the 2xl it fits perfect.
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Funky Smell when shipped from China,3,I have bought 5 of these coats because I like how they look & I live in a cold climate. The ones shipped from China have a funky smell when you open the package. The ones with prime delivery do not have the smell. I let them air out in my shed or garage for a few days & it goes away. Maybe a pesticide or something? I recommend ordering 2 or more sizes up. Decent winter coats that are warm.
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Order 3 sizes up,5,If u thinking bout ordering this coat...ORDER ITTT. When I tell I I love this jacket I’m about to order another one in a different color. I got the 4x cause I did want it to be to small it was perfect. I got so many compliments. People were really all over me about this coat.BUY IT!!!! Only down side is it didn’t have any inside pockets but I loved it!!!
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,WAY too s,3,"I loved the quality and feel of this coat. Unfortunately, I usually wear a large or extra large, so knowing it came from China I ordered an XXXL And I could still barely get it on! When I closed the coat, there was still a 4” gap in the front!"
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Read the Reviews and Set Expectations,4,I have been debating a coat like this for over a year.  I got a gift card and said go for it.  I read a majority of the reviews and tried to set expectations correctly.  I am 5’5” and 185 muscular build.  I have a broad chest and shoulders.  The reviews said go 3 sizes bigger than normal and shoulders would be tight.  Mine fits fantastic.  Right sleeve length.  A tad tight in the shoulders but I can move my arms.  My only issue is the single clasp used to close the jacked is very cheap and not at the same spot on each side so when closed it is lopsided.  I can easily have that fixed.  Happy I bought it.  Color (grey) looks great and it came packaged well.
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,love this coat,5,"I love this coat, very chic and stylish and how it fits. The quality seems great. It’s very warm but surprisingly light weight. The color is exactly what I was hoping it would be. I read the reviews and order a larger size based on my frame. I am I’m 5’10” 197lbs and ordered a size XXL, and it fit me perfectly. I would recommend to anybody looking for a warm winter coat that fits and it held up really well keeping you warm."
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Looked Great - Didn't Fit,4,The coat looked great coming out of the package. Just like real fur. The only problem was that it was too small and I ordered the largest size possible. Still too small. I wish they had a size that would fit me (I'm a USA Large) because it really was a great looking coat!
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Undo clasps before sitting,4,Went with the XXL because of previous recommendations- go 2 sizes above your normal- you won’t regret a little extra room.Not button front- has clasps.Fun. Warm. Comfortable. Buy it.
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,too small,1,"First I purchase a XL size , had to send back , too tight under the arms , re purchase a XXL AND STILL TOO TIGHT,Return item for full credit , did not repurchase , I loved the coat and the color"
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,What was this...?,2,What was this thing...Fur...LOL... It doesn't look good at all. They folded it up and the fur separated right there in the crease... LOL... I would not wear this in the rain in the my backyard. Cheap and ugly...
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Wow,3,"Received this coat a few days ago. Gosh it's look was better than expected. Quite Sheek,! But it's one size too small. So I'm definitely, definitely definitely going to order the next size up.... Definitely."
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Its small,2,"Im 6 2, 240 and it wasnt close to fitting. My wife is 5'8,130 and it's slightly big for her but fits much closer to her size than mine only being too long in the arms for me.  For me it is way too small in the arms, shoulders and chest for me.  Quality is fine for the money.  I tried to get a tailor to fix it but they wouldn't touch it.  Looks like a varmint fur coat.  Coloring is more mixed than striped like the picture shows for mine."
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Maybe it's a 3x for a midget,1,Lousy thing was too small. Waste of my time.
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,VERY NICE,5,This jacket for my boyfriend perfectly! He’s 6’4 and large jacket fits can be a little hard but this was just right <3
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Insanely Too Small,1,"Insanely too small.  I ordered 4x and my arm was too big to even fit down the sleeve, I fits like a medium or large, NOT a 4x.  Could not fully try it on as it was too small to even get my other arm in there"
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,"Great buy for the money, would recommend",5,"I expected a cheap piece of junk, it was for a Halloween costume.

Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Bad shedding,1,fur was not full.sheds a lot after trying it on.
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,"Size Up, most importantly enjoy.",4,OK so I got this for a coat for one reason and 1 reason  Only the black panther premiere this Thursday now why the coat fits a little snug it's still very great calling it was my own fault for not sizing up as I should have  I just didn't want to look like it was engulfing me I'm 6'2 165 pounds give or take  Just over all lengthy as all hell.
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Its a faux fur coat,4,"the color is pretty close to what you would expect. the fit is small I am 5'11 200 lbs and I purchased a XXXL The fit is a tad tight in the shoulder and my slowly shrinking waist will make the fit better in a month or so around the waist. Its a warm coat, and it has solid stitching so far."
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Inaccurate description,1,"Product size is way to small.  I wear a medium, purchased an XXXL, I cannot get my arms through the sleeves."
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Love it!,5,"The vest is sooooo gorgeous! I am normally a size small, I ordered a medium! Fits perfectly and I get lots of compliments! Love it!"
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Do not order runs too small,1,Product is too small and not to specifications listed.
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,Is this a joke,1,"I am 5'7"" 215 lbs muscular.  I wear large or xl in all other clothes.  I saw that this runs small so i ordered an xxl and i couldn't get my forearm through the shoulder hole.  Must be children's sizes."
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,"Fit, NOT EVEN CLOSE",2,I ordered the XXXXL to be on the safe side of things. All instruction for ordering size stated to allow 2x U.S. size. I allowed for three. The coat looks great. The quality is high visually. I noticed that if I attempted to fit the coat over my shoulders it would have ripped apart. Sad that this didn’t work out for me. I bought another from same seller (Brown) at the same time I ordered this coat. Perhaps that coat will work out. This is for a very small framed man.
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,"Cool looking coat, but makes it look like you have a cat at home",2,"I love the look of this coat. It's awesome. I just wish it were a bit sturdier. Three things I wish it had: A back vent, inside pocket (or pockets) and buttons to keep it closed. It does include three clasps, but they all bent and, eventually, ripped out of the coat completely.Unfortunately, everywhere I went, I left strands of a gray hair. I wore the coat probably three times before one of the pockets ripped open.This is an awesome coat to wear as long as you don't plan to go anywhere, I guess."
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,UNBELIEVABLY TINY. Okay costume quality.,2,"6'2, 230 freedom units. I ordered the largest size, a handful of Xs, followed by an L. It was too small. Worth keeping, as I could get it on and perform some movement, and it's for costumes, anyway. Very hot to wear, would actually make a good coat if you can size it right. If you think you have the size figured out, go up two sizes and expect it to be tight. It's also pretty small for the size."
Lafee Bridal Men's Luxury Faux Fur Coat Jacket Winter Warm Long Coats Overwear Outwear,"Good quality, Just go up 2 sizes",5,"I am a female (100cm bust, 76cm waist, 100 cm hips, 5'2'', 140 pounds) of a short stature who likes to wear men coats because of the different fit. I originally ordered the XXL because of the other comments but that fit too big on me. The arms are a bit long and the coat came past my knees. A Large fit wayyyy better for me. The fabric of the black and white coat is very soft, comfortable and does a great job of keeping the cold air out. I've had it for about a month and there hasn't been any signs of wear and tear. Its definitely a statement piece."

The North Face Men's Apex Chromium Thermal Jacket,Five Stars,5,My boyfriends obsessed with this new jacket
The North Face Men's Junction Insulated Jacket,Maybe go up a size if you look looser coats,5,"This is a size to fit. I maybe should have gotten a larger size, but it does fit, it just gets tighter when it’s zipped up and I sit down."
The North Face Men's Junction Insulated Jacket,True to size,4,"Product is great genuine North Face jacket, only writing a review to correct all the people who said it runs big this jacket is TRUE TO SIZE I ordered a size up after reading all the reviews and am having to return it for my regular size if anything it might run big so hopefully I can save someone else from ordering a size up when they don’t need to. Only reason it has 4 stars is because I was hoping for some sort of inside pocket but it is a great jacket for the price"
The North Face Men's Junction Insulated Jacket,I'd pass on this one.,3,It could have been a nice jacket. The lack of inside pockets and no drawstring at the base of the coat is a real turn-off for me. I realize you're just paying for the name but they could put a little bit of effort into their product. I found more adequate jackets with a lot more features for less of a price. North Face is just a brand I probably will never buy from them again.
The North Face Men's Junction Insulated Jacket,Great product,5,Product was true to size. Authentic North Face product and my son absolutely loves it. It is thinner than I expected but my son has worn it the last few days and says that it’s super warm.

The North Face Men's Junction Insulated Jacket,Maybe check the store.,3,Not sure about the sizing.  Not one of north faces best builds for sure.  I did however buy my daughter one and it's 80% better than mine.  Almost makes me wonder if I've bought a knock off build??

The North Face Men's Junction Insulated Jacket,"Comfortable, lightweight and warm!",5,This jacket looked amazing on my husband.

The North Face Men's Junction Insulated Jacket,Awesome: Amazon delivers again,5,The quality of the coat. My grandson loves it
The North Face Men's Junction Insulated Jacket,Love it,5,Excellent quality and great jacket!
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Super-Thin Collar,2,"When it is cold, it is crucial to protect your neck from the cold. This coat has nothing but a super-thin collar. No padding. No lining. Probably, brown paper is even thicker and warmer than this material of the collar.Useless.Otherwise, it is a very simple, utilitarian, inexpensive, light work coat, which I like about it and decided to try it out.Since this coat does not provide protection on the neck, I decided to return it. Shame.I give 2 stars, because the collar is the only issue with this coat. It could be 5 stars, if they improve the material of the collar."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Excellent Deal!,5,"Excellent every! Damn great jacket at an awesome price! Can't be beat!Update 5/12/21 - Coworkers were amazed by the price and quality of the jacket they both asked me to order them one.  A Third wants one as well, will order a 4th jacket once I bulk together a few different items to save on the boxes!  Thx Amazon Essentials for the great buys!  XL was like 8.50 and the second medium was like $7, can't beat that.  Price and quality!My mom was like what?!?!?! after checking it out, good stitching she said, won't fall apart quickly.... haha."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Snug in the chest with long arms,3,"Just like the title says, it's a bit snug around the chest and the arms are about 2 inches too long. Now, perhaps I have short arms, but it seems if my arms were any longer I would look like a gorilla. It's also thicker than I had thought. I was hoping to wear it during this 55-65 degree transitional weather, but this seems like it's more for the 30-40 degree weather. On the plus side, it was under $6...so it's not like I'm losing any real money."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Attractive & Efficient,5,Had to walk for 15 minutes in quite a squall. I stayed warm under this jacket. It kept out the rain and while not waterproof the fleece lining did not get wet. It dried quite quickly once I got inside. I get tons of compliments on it too!
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Collar is awful,3,"I'll give this product 3 stars only because the collar is absolutely awful. Other than that, the rest of the jacket is average quality. If the collar was made out of the same quilted portion of the jacket, that this would easily have a lux feel to it. Other than that, fit is TTS for me at least, and the quality is pretty good for the quilted portion. Seems like a nice light jacket for fall/spring."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Awesome for the price,4,"This jacket is great for the money. The cut gives me a more athletic look, like I’m actually in shape. Haha. My only criticism is that I was hopping it would be a little more light weight and it’s surprisingly warm, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing if you were wanted something a little warmer."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Throw on over your t shirt and jeans in 50-70 degree weather and look like James Bond.,5,"I bought this on sale and got three of them. They are comparable in warmth to a sweatshirt, but much less casual. Wear them with a white dress shirt and trousers for a modern springtime or early fall look. They are light weight but pretty high quality for the price I paid. I definitely suggest you buy one or four on sale; and then live in them instead of that gross old sweatshirt, you slob :). Remember, they are meant to be worn unbuttoned all the way."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,5 Stars,5,"Bought for my husband, he is skinny but with a long torso, and it is a little loose on him. I would recommend sticking to your actual shirt size and not go up, as some people usually do with jackets. Other than that, great product at an unbelievable price!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,This is my favorite go to jacket for cool weather it’s a pervert very comfortable,5,I like this jacket a lot! It’s got great pockets in the feel and comfort is superb! It’s terrific for casualwear and even dressed up. This is a great to go to jacket for cooled seasons even winter if you’re wearing it over layers!
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Very Nice Jacket,5,This is a very nice jacket. It's well made. It definitely will keep me warm when it's cold outside(good inner lining). I know this is a men's jacket but it fits me well(I wear size 22 & this is a 1x) & looks great.

Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Fits great.,5,Great price.  The first one was blck xxl for $7.21.  It fits so well that I bought a second jacket but this time it cost $14.00 and change.  The size is xxl olive green color.  Another good fit.
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Decent lightweight jacket for 20 bucks or less!!!,3,I got this jacket on special for 7 bucks so I can't complain much...I personally would not pay more than 20 dollars for this jacket...The collar is extremely thin and cheap feeling as well as the cuffs...The stitch pattern on the outside of the jacket also looks ugly in my opinion but for 7 bucks I'm going to use it as my work jacket...

Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,A jacket this good and this cheap is basically free.,5,"Ten bucks ??? It's practically free for what your getting. It's nice and warm, seems to be good quality. I did order a small and it arrived looking like a medium. Maybe IM just too small (5'2"" smaller frame), but smalls fit me 9/10 times so go figure. Nice coat. I will wear it until it falls apart."

Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Muy bien,5,Perfecto
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Very nice quality/Runs a size large,4,"Size:XLActual measurements:Chest - 25.5/51 inchesLength - 39 inchesArm Length - 30.5Fit:This is not for me, but for a family member. He's an XL in everything. According to the size chart, this should have fit him.He's a 46 inch chest. The size chart indicates an XL has a range of 44-47 inches.However, this is clearly about 4 inches larger in the chest, than reported.I'm not sure if they assume this jacket will be layered over hoodies or what, but that's quite a discrepancy.If you're an XL and have a chest that's between 44-47, I'd suggest you move one size down unless you prefer a baggy fit.This is a medium weight jacket appropriate for early to late fall.In sum, this is very well made, but runs a size large. I do recommend it based on quality, but I suggest you move down a size unless you're at the very high end of a size and prefer a baggy fit.Recommended4 starsCheers!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Weird stitching pattern/Runs a tad large.,3,"I received this jacket in a size large for my boyfriend who is 6 ft and approx 215 lbs. His usual size in tops is a men's XL or sometimes a large. We were both a little surprised with the good fit, as we expected it to be too small. The jacket seems to run a bit large, which worked out great for us! In my experience, nearly all Amazon Essentials items are on the bigger side so you may want to size down.The jacket has a very smooth, windbreaker type material on the outside, while the inside is lined with a decent quality fleece that's a shade or two lighter in color than the outside fabric.This has snap buttons going up the center rather than a zipper and two buttoned pockets over the chest area. It also has two convenient hand pockets that are useful for storing your phone or wallet.I'm giving this jacket a 3 star rating for two reasons:#1. The sleeves are way too short. As you can see in my photos, when you reach for something or even just extend your arm the sleeves leave quite a bit of wrist and arm exposed.#2. The jacket is quilted, which I had read in the product description, but the stitching looks very feminine with it's squiggly lines. My boyfriend didn't even notice but it stands right out to me. I would have expected a men's jacket to have straight stitching lines or none at all.The jacket is comfortable but thin. It's definitely not something I'd recommend for the cold winter months. Springtime weather would be much more appropriate, unless you live a warmer climate.The overall look is kind of odd but this has great craftsmanship and durability. $35 is a more than reasonable price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,For Slimmer Builds...,4,"The model picture makes it look like this might work for a ""thicker"" guy, but if you have any gut or hip you may have trouble zipping this - it is a bit longer than it looks and not as ""boxy"".  My husband an friend of his and I all tried this on, and while they could both zip it over their hips, my husband could just barely zip it over his 42in belly.  Additionally, both said it was too tight in the shoulders (and neither are muscular men).  Too tight for either to wear.  I wasn't going to have that issue (we wear close to the same size is stuff and share some clothes) with my 37in waist and 40in bust and less burly shoulders, but my 44in booty was blocking my use of the zipper at all.So if you're a bit pear-shaped, might take a tape and measure your belly and hip/butt and make sure of what you are size-wise.  If you have burly shoulders, you might size up.Otherwise the fit was good - arms are fine for all of us.A thin fleece fabric inside the main body with slick liner for the arms.  Pair of outer hand pockets that are hand-sized and the chest pockets are good for your phone.  No interior pockets.Hardware seems of middling quality - not the best, not the cheapest either.  Decent stitching.I think it is perfectly priced for what it is.  Just wish it had been more like what was pictured in terms of ratios.  Something boxier to fit a thicker guy."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Runs a bit small,4,"This jacket runs a little small. I do normally wear a small but in this jacket, if I raise my arms or extend them in any way the jacket sleeves are too short. The same happens for the length of this jacket. If I raise up my arms, my midsection will be exposed. Just walking around this jacket keeps me warm and is soft and cozy on the inside. If I were to wear a thick sweatshirt, this jacket would be more cumbersome but I usually wear t-shirts so the fit is fine across the chest.There are four pockets, which is great as they can accommodate most I what I need to carry with me.I have laundered this coat and it washes very well.Overall I do like wearing this coat and it keeps me warm."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Thin jacket for autumn/spring weather,3,"Kind of neutral on this jacket. I normally wear a large, but this ""large"" size is slightly small for me. I can put it on and wear just fine but would be great if it was an inch or two wider (for a better fit). The front doesn't have a zipper instead snap button are used. Not sure I like that. I prefer a zipper to close the front of the jacket. There are four pockets, two hand pockets in the usual places and two breast pockets with snap buttons. The inside is lined with fabric so it feels soft and smooth. The outer layer is water resistant. Would have gave it 4 stars if it came with a zipper front instead of snap buttons."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Nice all-weather stylish jacket,5,"This short coat is very stylish, doesn't really have a ""workman"" look to it.  It's likely the sheen and the quilted stitching that gives it this appearance. The inside of the jacket has a nice warm lining and the pockets are secure.  If you're not too round in the midsection (ahem), you may actually be able to use the snap buttons on the front ... as for me, I just wear it open.  :-)  The jacket has snap button pockets on the chest and regular open pockets around the sides.  Overall, I recommend this for spring or fall."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Nicely made jacket...,4,"I ordered this Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket for my husband, in a size XX-Large.  It fits him well, with a slightly loose fit, which he prefers.  The fabric is nice, and the stitching is neatly done.  There are 2 pockets in the chest area, which snap for security.  There are also 2 waist pockets that are of sufficient size to slip your hands into.  This is not a suitable jacket for winter weather, unless you live in a milder climate.  We all have different tolerances to cold weather, but my husband considers it comfortable in 45-65 degree temperatures.  He doesn't care for the curved quilting pattern on the jacket, and said it would have looked better with straight lines."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Casual Lightweight Quilted Coat,4,"This is a lightweight coat for cold, but probably above freezing temperatures. The styling is quilted with pockets that my husband found acceptable for wear. He plans to use it for a trip to Arizona in January where it should work well for the winter temperatures there. We live in TN so it will work many days here as well. It's more casual than dressy but that works for running errands or such when one is going in and out of cars and buildings rather than hanging around outside for very long. It will also pack well. He deemed it a keeper and a good price for the quality and styling."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Not for winter but for light fall weather,3,Let me start off with a good: the material used to build this coat feels good. But if you live in New York like me where it snows horribly this is not the coat you should be getting. This coat is Great for fall weather swear it’s light winter. But if you are planning to wear this outside where it’s 50° or less then I would plan wearing two hoodies and then this coat. Overall great - sadly not for the purpose of winter.
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,"Very nice jacket - lightweight, but warm",5,This is a nicely made jacket. It is lightweight but very warm. It also keeps you a bit cooler if you are prone to overheating. It is almost like having your or thermostat in clothing form. Snaps and buttons are well made and installed. The fabric pattern is nice instead of just plain lines or all black. Subtle but nice to have.
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Husband loves it,5,"This men's quilted shirt jacket is my husbands so this review is from his perspective.Surprisingly warm! Nice attractive shirt but it's well padded too with decent size pockets. Better left with the front open. On a cold day I wore this outside without a jacket. I've also used it as a sweater (of sorts) and it was very comfy.There it was, folks. He absolutely loves it. Hope he's helped you one way or another :D"
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,My New Favorite Jacket,5,"This is a simple, no frills, good looking jacket.  It fits in equally well working in the yard and on my commute.  The arms are quilted but with less fill so your arms don't get as warm if you're working while the chest and back have just the right amount of loft to keep me warm.  The fit is fantastic and it looks great.I highly recommend this jacket!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,A Lightweight Jacket,4,"The Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt is a light weight coat that is warmer than a shirt but not as heavy as a coat. It is comfortable and warm. It has ample sized pockets. I would not use this as a primary coat but as a layering item. It is effective when layered but is only mildly protective in serious cold weather. It is great for a cool day, though. It has plenty of moving room inside. Overall, I like this quilted shirt."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Got these XL for $6!!!!,5,How these are not so expensive beats me. Got these on my wife’s prime account for $6!!! They feel awesome. I’m in the Bay Area and this is the perfect jacket for these parts.
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,More jacket than shirt,5,"This is a great jacket. I like that it is quilted and has a short-pile fleece lining. It is plenty warm. It also has great pockets, two flap pockets on the chest and two hand-warmer pockets on the lower part of the jacket. This shirt jacket is more of a jacket, but not too thick. This one is a winner!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Light weight work jacket,3,This is an okay jacket.  Nothing overly special about it except that if you know you are going to be working on something and maybe ruin a jacket this would be the one you would wear.  This does run a little small by about a size.  My guy is 6' 250lbs and usually wears an XL in every jacket.  This fits him closer to a Large.  While he does fit in it there just isn't a lot of comfortable movement with clothing underneath on.  Nothing special just okay.
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Comfortable and warm,4,"Overall this is a nice quilted shirt, and it's very warm. I live in the upper midwest and our winters can be brutal, so this is comfortable enough to wear inside all day.  The inside lining is soft and comfortable."
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Excellent utility type jacket!,4,"I'm not so sure that I would use this jacket as a ""fancy casual"" jacket. It's more of a look that goes toward a work look (to me). It's a fantastic jacket, don't get me wrong, I just think that the ""look"" goes more toward things that my husband would get for work. It's great for cooler mornings and light rain!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Good light weight jacket,5,My husband really liked this jacket it is light weight yet very warm and not restraining at all. He said it was very comfortable. Looks very good on the design it has is very subtle nothing crazy. He likes it and recommends it!
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Too short a bit boxy,3,A quality looking material but didn’t fit the best. It feels very boxy. It also was too short and hits you funny. I am 6 foot and was too short for me. Perhaps if you are shorter this will work better for you.
Amazon Essentials Men's Quilted Shirt Jacket,Just okay,3,I find this a little frumpy-looking. It's a big square of quilted black fabric with sleeves and a collar attached - no particular details that lend an air of classiness or style.

Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Cascades Explorer Ordered, Steens Mountain Ships",1,"I reach up to where the chest pockets are suppose to be.  Oops.  No pockets.  What happened?The product description is for a Cascades Explorer jacket.  The item that ships is a Steens Mountain jacket.What is the difference?  Those are 2 different products.Amazon's ""customer service"" advised to just check the product description, they are very similar jackets.  So that's it?  Your warehouse ships the wrong product, and the customer is just stuck with your mistakes?Product is made of generic polyester fleece.  Polartec Fleece is graded by product weight, which will indicate thickness and warmth factor.  Since this is not branded as Polartec, there is no rating.  So for anyone interested in whether this product is 100g, 200g, or 300g; don't rack your mind or lose any sleep.Brands like The North Face will use Polartec and give you a rating.  The North Face Denali fleece jacket is what most people use as a bar to measure by.  Polartec 300 fleece with a water and wind repellant overlay at the shoulders and forearms, zippered vents under the arms, and the option of a hooded model.  This is the civilian version of what the military uses.This Columbia item is by look and feel, a lot lighter in weight and thinner.  The wind blows right through.  In my area, where temperatures dip to 40 degrees Fahrenheit at night, with winds less than 5 miles per hour, all year long, this jacket did not keep me warm when worn over a t-shirt.  At 40 degrees Fahrenheit, when you are indoors wearing just a t-shirt, you should be able to go outside with a good jacket.  This is not a good jacket.  After all, I am not in freezing conditions.  Simply an overnight chill.  A light chill, and this jacket did not keep me warm.Fans of Columbia fleece products, and there are many as evidenced by the surging sales of their ever popular Steens Mountain fleece jacket, will argue that this is a great layer.  I agree.  I know how well this could work as a mid layer over a t-shirt, and under a top layer.  But that does not make it a good jacket.  A good jacket should keep you warm all by itself.  And as I sit here indoors, where it is 72 room temperature, it feels great.  But I am just as warm indoors, in a climate controlled room, with just a t shirt.  When I step outside to go to the car, I will need to put a real jacket on over this.  And if I have to stand out on the corner for 30 minutes to wait for a bus, wearing just this jacket, I will freeze.  What good is a jacket that you have to wear another jacket over?  So for a jacket to be good when you don't need a jacket at all; that just makes it a lousy jacket."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Very bad.,1,Terrible quality. Stitches are sticking out. Didn't expected from Columbia.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Pretty good, will last you until the ice caps are gone and winters are no more",5,"Really a fantastic jacket for the price. It’s important to note that the material, though soft, warm, comfortable, and just nice to touch is synthetic, and as with pretty much all half/full synthetic Sherpa-type materials, any kind of moisture on your skin makes the fuzz clump if you stroke it against the grain. Basically, you just shouldn’t wear it if you’re in the kind of weather where you’re taking it off and putting it on every few minutes, because that is just too warm for this jacket. The sleeves are a bit long, but not so much that those with fairly regular length-width proportions will notice too much, but enough that taller wearers aren’t plagued by cold wrists like with everything else. The cut is also a bit wider at the midriff, so those wider between the chest and belt will feel just as comfortable in this jacket as slimmer people will in a slimmer cut, but it’s not so wide that slimmer people cant wear it. I’m somewhere in between, and I enjoy having a bit of room to move the jacket around without it being excessively baggy. It’s very warm, and the ivy/chart color is nice, but more that the jacket is a tad lighter than the photo, most likely a lighting or iso issue in photoshoot.If you need something that’s really warm and/or tighter fitting so it functions as an actually good under layer for a slimmer person, check out one of Columbia’s other under layers, which are also pretty decent quality and very well priced. If you’re going for just a fleece or a fleece to wear under just a thin down jacket, you’re in the right place.5/5 would buy again but I won’t have to because Columbia’s products last decades and winters on earth will be in the 30s °C by then"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Go one size smaller,4,"For those of you who are concerned about the sizing, and have read in other reviews to go one size down, PLEASE DO SO.  I am 5' 11"" 175 lbs, weight size 33 inches, neck 15 1/2 inches, chest size 46 inches.  I usually wear a size large T-shirt.  But after reading the reviews on sizing, I decided to take a chance and order the medium size. It fits perfectly, not too tight, and not baggy.  Comfortable fit would be the term.  So yes, go one size down. As far as quality goes, good quality.  Felt very warm when I wear them under my Northface Thermoball jacket with an outer windproof shell."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Small details mean a lot...,5,"Well-made, durable, and warm.  This excellent fleece jacket fits perfectly, has elastic cuffs, has YKK zippers, has two roomy pockets with zippers, and has excellent stitching throughout.  I own other brands of full-zip fleece jackets, but this one is my absolute favorite because of the attention to detail by the manufacturer.  Can be worn alone as a jacket or as a mid-layer under a wind-proof shell.  A well-designed garment that gives you options.  Highly recommended."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,shimmer me timbers,5,"I love this sweater very much. I got the tusk and now the rust red color. the tusk  is more of a gray than  beige aND the red is more of an orange. Its got nice interior pockets which the older ones do not. I love its full length zipper allowing me to zip all the way up my neck saving body heat during the colder and windy seasons here in las vegas. It feels durable and well constructed unlike the lower budget sweaters I have. It is extremely lightweight while being very warm as well. it seems to be perfect for las vegas winter temps which rarely ever drop below the 30s. i want to add their size chart may be wrong as I am 55'"" male 138 pounds and I fOlli wed the size chart and got a medium. it was too long and baggy for my preference so I ordered a small and it was perfect. sI do not be swayed by others insisting it is consistent with United States ssizing it's not. I emphatically contend in spite of a reviewer claiming it is not water/stain repellent that it in fact is; I spilled sauce on it as I was eating at McDonalds and it left absolutely no mark at all."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Fits great, looks good - get one!",5,"I have worn this jacket from Columbia in one form or another for a couple decades, and this one was yet another quality product that fit great and looked good.  I'm a big guy (6'6"" and 280) and the 3xl Tall fits like it was tailor made for me. Love the wide array of colors too - so often big and tall stuff comes in your choice of black or navy. I took one of these on a backpacking tour of Scotland and it kept me warm (needed a light rain shell, however, since these are not waterproof and it rains there half the time). So if you're in the big/tall category, don't hesitate to get one of these beauties."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"And, I thought I could trust them....",2,"First Impressions: Perhaps, it was the name or the picture or Amazon's reputation for quality. In any event, I expected more, much more, in fact, than I received. Positive: It fits. Negatives are several: Lightweight...more like a pajama top than a real fleece; cheaply constructed...seemingly of leftover materials; not warm unless trapped between two or more layers; generally useless in any type of cold weather; resembles something one finds in a second hand store; excessively overpriced for what is delivered; and, lastly, very unlike other Columbia products I own that do deliver what is advertised.All in all, I will be reluctant to purchase again based on name, picture, or merchant reputation. Sadly disappointed with product, price now that I've seen the product, and with Amazon for carrying something like this as credible merchandise. BUT, it does fit."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,WOAH! An honest review! I dig this jacket!!,5,"OKAY! So, everyone either says order a size larger, order smaller, or order your normal size. It's almost as if everyone's body-type is different or something! Say what? So my measurements are 69"" (5'9.5"") 170lbs, 32.5 inch waist, 33.5 inch inseam, maybe 18% body fat, active running and weightlifting lifestyle. I ordered a SMALL and it fits PERFECTLY! It is not baggy in the slightest, and definitely not snug. It sits almost up against my body, but with plenty of room and it is NOT movement-restricting. As for performance, these suckers are soft as all get out and very warm. However, if there is any amount of wind more than a slight breeze, you will probably feel it. This is NOT a windbreaker, nor is it designed to be one. It has slight water shedding capabilities, so anything above a washington-esque drizzle will get you wet. It is a perfect warm grab and go fleece, and would work wonders layered under one of Columbia's (or any brands) waterproof shells."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Highly recommend. Best jacket I've owned in a long time!,5,"I am 5'11 and 185 pounds. I have a difficult time getting clothing. Medium is too short in length, and too tight at the waist. Large is too big at the shoulders, and the sleeves are too long. This jacket fit me PERFECTLY in size large. Sleeves are just right, shoulder seems are where they need to be, and it's not too short. Nice being able to stretch without my belly showing. This jacket is very warm, and made of very high quality. I paid $32 for this jacket, and the tags read $74. I would have paid $150 for this jacket. Camo is wonderful as well."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Been buying these for years, love 'em",5,"They're warm, affordable and look good. I wear them constantly in cool weather. I walk or hike daily, and as I warm up I zip the pockets closed (if they have anything in them), unzip the front and zip it a little behind my back, then pull it off my shoulders and arms, bring it around front and zip it up, hold it by the sleeves and flip the torso part to wrap it as small as possible, then tie it around my waist by the sleeves. I can do that while walking, so I don't fall behind my wife or friends."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Not a red jacket at all.,3,"This IS a Columbia jacket and it’s very nice. I Love these jackets. The reason I ordered this jacket is because it said red. It never said anything about orange. There is clearly orange in this jacket, more suitable color name would be burnt orange. There’s nothing red about this jacket but I like it and will keep it. Next time I order something red, it needs to be red!! If it’s not red, don’t name it red! The jacket is Burnt Orange, got it!?"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Love this,5,"I'm a plus sized woman who struggled much with finding a fleece jacket that fits and looks nice; this jacket looks great on me. I'm guessing if you're a woman who likes outdoor activities and is also plus sized, you have experienced the difficulty with finding active wear -- I can't find a single article of clothing made for women that is in my size at any of the high quality/performance outfitters. I normally wear an XL to a 1X in women's tops; it's been a while since ordering this but I believe I  went to the Columbia sight and used their size chart and bought this in XL; it fits me perfectly and is very attractive -- I get frequent compliments when wearing this. Not only is it attractive, it washes well, is very soft and warm, and is the perfect length. If I were going to complain at all, it is that this is bulky and takes up quite a bit of room in my pack; but if warmth is your priority, this is the right choice."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great jacket. Great product,4,"Great jacket. Great product. Quality.I had to return due to the color. The Marine Blue and the Super Blue on my computer looked like basically the same color so I chose one, but when Marine Blue arrived, it was more bluish-greenish than I wanted (hence why it's called Marine), almost reminded me of a teal, and so I returned it and chose Super Blue instead.Loved the Super Blue when it arrived.My husband loved the Marine Blue when he saw it. He would have kept the color if it was his. We ordered four of these all total (in different sizes for the two of us). I think they're pretty unisex and are great for throwing on a bit of warmth on a walk or a day out."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great multi-use fleece,5,"Columbia does good work once again.  This fleece was a steal at $25.  It replaced several things from my wardrobe, including those dirty old hooded sweatshirts that seem to linger in every closet.  Besides being a solid spring/fall jacket, it also makes a great ""warm up"" layer for going to the gym, hiking, or whatever.  The pockets are perfect size, location, and are quite warm.I'm a wide-set guy and this jacket fits me well.  Maybe they only design the ""XL"" size to fit guys with my body type.  Nonetheless, for those with narrower shoulders and hips, I would consider ordering another style of fleece."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Thsi is a nice soft fleece,4,Thsi is a nice soft fleece. Not as nice as some higher priced Columbia fleece I've ha dbut the price was great. I bopught the tradwinds grey a sit was only $16.50 for a Columbia product and that is amazing. For teh price I like the buy. The color seems a bit more blue-ish to me than I wanted and than the image showed. I can live with it an dhope it fades a bit and it will be fine. The Large actually is a bit bigger than most large outer wear I have. Not in a huge way bu will just not be a fitted wear on me. I can live with it. At teh price thsi will be a great cozy fleece I can beat up on if needed. Not in love with this one but certainly in like with it. Material and construction is solid though and still love the Columbia brand. I woudl buy this again with all this being said.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great Jacket,5,"I ordered two different colors. I got them 4 days earlier than the projected delivery date. They were well packaged and only folded up one time, not folded into a small ball, etc. I just hung them up for about 2 hours to let the fabric relax. They fit great and I can even wear a dress shirt under them because I am a Large but I ordered XL sizes to accommodate the shirts. I have looked all over the place for this type of jacket because I like the collar type instead of the hoodie type. I work in a business casual environment  and these are acceptable by the company polices. I got a lot of compliments on them too. You really cannot go wrong with these. Even in cold and windy conditions, they block that out very well. I probably will be ordering more colors later on. Thanks."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"VERY poor sewing, gave out in two months!",1,Bought two of these and within two months both have stitching that has given out.  One has lost all of its wrist stitching around the elastic wrist band....the other had stitching give out with the connection to the draw string around the waist.  Columbia products used to last a long time.....these don't hold a candle to MANY previous items I've owned!
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Just arrived today, it's so soft. It was ...",2,"Just arrived today, it's so soft. It was for my son and he absolutely loves it.* UPDATE -washed it before my son was to wear it, the zipper came apart!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Problem with material flattening,3,I found the thickness of the nap to be far thinner than any of the other Columbia jackets I've purchased through Amazon.I returned the first jacket because the nap flattened and would not return to the stand up position giving the appearance of a stain.The second jacket does essentially the same thing. The only reason I am keeping it is I like the color. Could the country of manufacture (Bangladesh) have anything to do the flattening issue?
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Highly recommend,5,"Fit as expected. Color is a little more purple than maroon or burgandy as it appears in pics but not too much. It's a good lighter weight fleece for layering. Has 2 zip pockets on outside, the pullcord tightening at bottom, elastic sleeves, inside pockets also. Full zip front. Bought for my dad for Christmas. He loves it. Great quality."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great jacket with one (possibly large)caveat,4,"Good jacket, warm and comfy and good fit as well. The only problem, that could possibly be a deal breaker for some, is that the zipper doesn't like to close the collar. This is not any fault with the zipper, but the fleece being sewn too close to the zipper track, thus preventing closure. If one gets around to pulling the fabric away from the track, the zipper closes just fine."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great jacket and great price,5,This is a great quality jacket for the price.  It looks great and is super comfortable.  It is also light enough where you can keep it on even after the temp gets a little higher.  But zipping it up keeps you nice and warm when the sun goes down.I got the medium and found it to be a bit larger than expected (I had another jacket that was a small that was a bit tight around the hips when zipped) so I got the medium.  The top is pretty nice and can go around the neck for extra warmth and it has zipper pockets on the outside and also has additional pockets inside.I am really happy with this jacket and highly recommend it!!!
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,My current jacket is excellent. As far as the manufacturing goes,5,"The first Full Zip jacket I received had a defect in the zipper stitching. I immediately returned it and ordered another Full Zip jacket. That was a minor pain in the neck. My current jacket is excellent. As far as the manufacturing goes, the main zipper and the two outer pockets all zip properly. During my inspection of the jacket, I found no loose threads or other defects. The two inner pockets were fine, no zippers. The fleece weight is appropriate for light spring/fall weather (for me, anyway - I live in Southern California), not a terribly heavy fleece. I have a long torso and the jacket length is good for me. I expect a quality product from Columbia and this jacket meets my expectations fully."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,I few minor issues with mine,3,Love the colors on this but mine has a slight issue in a few places. Not sure if it's a factory second or just a knock off. I tried to wash it to see if that would fix the issue but it's still there. For the price it was worth it. Just wish it didn't have the few spots that look off like they do.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Fits a little tight,3,"I odered a 4x, and I know I'm a bigger guy and I know different brands fit differently, however this fits pretty snug. I would purchase a size bigger if you don't want it tight."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Excellent jacket and priced well,5,Great jacket for the price.  I had one of these I wore for 7 or 8 years.  They last a long time and are great for mild weather or layering up for the cold.  I like that the pockets zip shut and there is a zip chord around the waist you can adjust to restrict air flow and fit.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Sizing is bizarre.,3,"I am rating this 3 stars because the price is pretty good for an okay product. The sizing however, is complete bonkers. I wear a medium in every single piece of clothing I have ever worn. For some reason, Columbia thinks people have chicken wings for arms and have made the sleeves on this thing have an enormous width. The sleeves are also quite long. Returned the medium for a small and everything fits a little better, the chest is a little snug but I'll trade that for sleeves that are functional.The fleece feels very soft, I will be testing this out this weekend backpacking and hope to have good results."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Great fit, looks good.",5,"I have several of these fleece jackets in different colors. They become my outer garment during the colder months. They're versatile and can be worn open, partially zipped, or as a turtleneck. What more can I say?  ;-)"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Great jacket, sized a bit big",4,"As fall approached, I started to gain a bit of weight, and my small black Columbia jacket wasn't cutting it anymore, so I got an upgrade. This jacket is warm yet light, the colors are great, but the size was a bit bigger than I figured it would be. My original was a small and when I compare them, it looks more like a large (I purchased a Men's Medium). The material quality, the comfort, and the color were all great, but just a bit bigger than I had expected. It'll still come in handy next fall.

Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0, Tradewinds Grey/Graphite, Medium"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Comfy and looks great, some quality issues",4,"There is not much in my size that is this comfortable and looks classy enough to wear in most situations. The accessible price is also a big deal.Four stars instead of five because the stitching around the cuffs has loosened and had to be partially removed. I did not have this issue with my previous Columbia fleece. It won't be difficult to repair, but it is disappointing."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Great Product, fits perfectly, but I'm not sure its the color I ordered....",2,"I must say that this is a very cool Jacket, its soft and keeps me warm in the Office ( Which is like an infernal Tundra). I ordered the same model like 3 weeks before purchasing this one ( Got the charcoal boulder color, very pleased with that one) and I would've give it 5 stars if the product would've matched the color I ordered. You see, I ordered a Boulder Model, which in the picture looks very Brownish to me ( Unless I'm starting to develop Daltonism), What I actually got is a Gray jacket. Still the reason for my 2 stars it's not because of the product itself which is great, its because the item picture is very misleading and doe snot reflect the actual color of the jacket."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Zippers seem fine but the pulls always get lost--theyre a piece of ...,3,"Very thin in the arms--like, below 50 your arms freeze.  Does not stop the wind.  Torso does a decent job.  Zippers seem fine but the pulls always get lost--theyre a piece of once knotted string.  The fleece itself feels good.  the cuffs have about the right amount of elastic.  Mine has inside and outside pockets, but the inside pockets are big and deep and best for light things like mail or a few pieces of paper.  color was a tad darker than the pic.WORKS PERFECT UNDER A THREE SEASON JACKET!!  which is why I bought it.  Mine is an UnderArmour Fractle and it makes it an all season jacket in MN."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,The color is significantly off.,1,"I ordered the ""delta, stone"" color. In the picture that Amazon shows, the bottom color is a grayish-beige. The color on the actual garment that was shipped is an off-white.Prior to writing this review I searched other reviews and found it is a common issue with this garment. Buyer beware."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Nice Product,5,"The Columbia Mountain Full Zip - as well as the Cathedral Peak Vest - are very nice and comfortable products - which most of the reviews agree with - However, I'm writing this review to talk about sizing - as few reviews actually deal with this very important aspect of any online purchase.  So I wish more people would post their height and weight and what size worked well for them.  With the vest and the Mountain Full Zip I actually ended up purchasing a medium in both styles - even though I normally wear a large in just about everything else.  For the record, I'm six feet tall and weigh 182 pounds - and the mediums fit perfectly."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Exactly as advertised. Quality product,5,I love the Columbia fleece jackets. This one is a beautiful blue. It really makes my son’s eyes pop. It washes well and is soft and does not fade after many washes. I have Columbia fleece that is 6 years old and still looks and feels good. I highly recommended.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Solid lightweight warm jacket,4,"Solid lightweight jacket that’s still super warm. The collar can be annoying at times because it doesn’t like being folded or moved that much but nothing crazy. All fit well for me, but the upper arms can be a bit snug & the arm length itself seems to stretch after use."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great jacket,5,"This jacket is really beautiful, colors are a little bit darker than the appear but it is worth every last penny or so I thought.....  problem i have now is that I put my jacket in the washer and the darm front zipper came off while washing and now it's no where to be found and that's messed up because I really liked this jacket now I have to throw it away....... RIP off"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,A great default fleece sweater.,5,What else do you need to know. just thick enough without being bulky. warm. doesn't pill too badly. It's lasted for quite a while. No holes are seam tears. Good quality. If you want a fleece sweater but don't know exactly what togetthen this is a great place to start. I don't know who could ever be unhappy with one of these.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,bad zippers,3,"I've bought these many times and have quite a few. But the last batch after a couple of washing and drying the zip came off. I've got some that are one or two years old I use for night  shirts and obviously ,have treated them the same as the new ones. But the new ones didn't have the quality of the older  orders. , I guess its a hit or miss buy and hard to buy sweats without hoods  so I may have to risk my luck  quite soon :("
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Columbia Fleece is top notch,5,"I bought my first Columbia Fleece at the Washington State Cougar store.  It fit so well, plus has the construction I like (simple hems) no elaborate cuffs that can ride up your arms or up your back when you be bend over.  The Cougar Jacket had a thin liner, which works well for most Seattle winter weather conditions doing errands and things. I bought another wind stop version Columbia fleece which fit very well and works very well in colder windier winter conditions in Seattle.  I bought my latest Columbia fleece (Men's Steens Mountain Fleece) as a layering item for overnight outdoor times in cold conditions.  It is very light weight (no liner) so it works well backpacking and being used with a Goretex Jacket. I have tried a lot of fleece from Lands End and Patagonia.  I like Columbia Fleece the best."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Nice light jacket,4,"This jacket is very light and comfortable to wear and deceptively warm. I have only just received it so I’m not sure how it will hold up to wear & tear, cleaning or if will produce cold weather shocks when touching door knobs, cars, and etc.Update: I really like the two large inner pockets. I do not like how tight the wrists are and the difficulty going over hands. It is very warm (maybe too warm) on a sunny calm day. If the wind is blowing it goes right through the jacket, so requires a windbreaker either over or under it. I really should deduct one star but I will let it stand."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Excellent fleece tops...these are my go-to jackets!,5,"These are excellent for wearing around the house during our frigid Wisconsin winters.  It's been brutal here this year weather-wise and we have a propane crisis.  So the heat got turned down in the house to 64 degrees.  With these over just a t-shirt, I stay nice an comfortable all day around the house.  They are very good quality and last a long time.  I like them so much, I bought two extras because I don't want to chance them being discontinued in the future.  The one I have on right now as I write this review is about four years old and still going strong.  Very easy to wash and does not ball up.  LOVE IT!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Top quality and very soft,5,This has a very nice feel to it while wearing. The fabric is very soft and smooth.  It also looks very nice to wear. Of course the price is great but you already know that. It is quite warm although not so much as some reviewers would lead you to believe. Someone mentioned that he wore it outside in Alaskan winter and didn't feel cold. I am not so sure about that. There have been certain October days when I have felt cold if I was wearing just this over my T shirt (I live in Illinois). The zipper is a little tricky but you get used to it. I like the fact that you can move the zipper all the way to your neck so you don't really need a muffler. All in all a great purchase and I have been very happy about it.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Beware!  Not too Big!,1,"These fleece fit small. I wear a 2XL usually in Big & Tall, so I ordered these in 2X Plus, in Big & Tall category, .thinking they must be the same as 2XL or maybe bigger fit (with the word - ""Plus"" in it).  But not so.  Returned all 4.  I already have 3 other Columbia Fleece size 2XL Big & Tall I bought somewhere else that fit fine!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great summer/fall jacket,5,"Bought this for travel and outdoor adventure, specifically a trip to Africa.  I am really impressed by the color scheme as it looks sharp, but wont make you stand out in nature.  The weight of the fleece will keep you warm for summer nights and through the fall, without being too heavy.  This is not really a winter coat unless you live in a  warmer climate.The fit is standard Columbia which is dead on for me (6'3"" guy about 200 lbs and I wear a Large).  If you are unsure go try on anything Columbia at a local store first, their stuff tends to all fit about the same."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Terrible material used for pockets,1,"The jacket is generally pretty good but, like noted by many others, the material used for the inside of the pockets is a cheap nylon that catches on dry skin and is *extremely* uncomfortable.  I bought two of these and would have kept them both except for the fact that the pockets were so bad, and I sent them back.  If Columbia uses a softer/smoother material for the pockets in the future, I will probably buy one."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Nice jacket, slight quality control issues",4,"This has worked really well for me, it was a bit smelly to start but that out gassing has faded and now its nice.  I've had some one thread come loose but it hasn't affected it yet, just cut it short and its doing ok.  The zipper strings have come loose and don't seem to stay on well but since it is just an extension of the zipper it works just as well without them."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,I practically live in this it's so comfortable.,5,"I love it. It's very warm and soft. They are long at the waist, so your rear end will stay warm... Lol. The 3X was too big for me, so I gave it to my son and got a 2X for myself. I'm 6'2"" and my son is over 6'6"". You WILL NOT regret buying this."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,These are crazy good. This is the second one I have bought ...,5,"These are crazy good. This is the second one I have bought and they are great. I purchased a XL a year or so ago and a L this week. As for the fit, the XL is nice for layering. It provides a bit more room. The large is a closer fit and feels good. The only complaint I have is the collar on the large. When zipped up I wish there was a bit more room; a little tight. The price though is better than any other and the feel is super comfortable. What more do you want for $25..."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Fits perfect,5,This Columbia  jacket fit my Husband perfect.He normally wears a large so that's what I ordered.This  looks great on him and leaves enough room to wear layers of shirts under this.I wouldn't expect him to wear this on very cold days of course but it's perfect right now while the weather in Newengland is still in the 50s for December. Very comfortable and roomy.Of course you can't beat the price ! I ended up buying a few more for my son's since the quality and price was excellent.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Just not warm enough,3,"Large Size:Made in Sri Lanka100% Polyester28"" length in back35"" sleeveCinch at bottom on one side (I would rather have good quality elastic)Inside pockets (But they are open at the top)Zippered hand pockets (But the pocket material is thinner and scratchy, not as warm)Elastic on wrists is a little too loose (I would rather have nice 2"" long elastic)Smells kind of like fish.Just not warm enough for northern California coastal fog and wind."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,no one makes a fleece like columbia does.,5,"great fleece jacket! warm and thick without being bulky, soft and cozy, excellent quality and fit. they have a nice solid zipper and a hidden drawstring at the bottom for fitting to form. i haven't found anyone who makes fleeces quite as well as columbia does. they can be pricey, but if you wait for a good sale they are well worth it. i've seen other reviews mentioning knock offs, but the two i ordered directly through amazon appeared to be completely authentic and were great quality, for what it's worth."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"basic quality fleece jacket, sizing runs large",4,"This is a basic quality fleece jacket. Probably Columbia's cheapest fleece. Midweight fleece is somewhat warm, but not weather resistant, so you will need to wear a shell over it in windy or rainy weather. Like most Columbia shirts and jackets, sizing is very large. I weigh 160 pounds and size SMALL fits well (over a T-shirt or base layer). The neck is kind of tall and stiff; I wish it had more stretch."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great - You'll Love it!,5,"This is my second one of these Columbia Outerwear jackets, they are very nice and a good quality product, seems to be true to size. They look very nice, are lightweight, quite comfortable, keeps the chill off providing warmth in mildly cool to chilly weather. I use it for chilly days at work, cool early morning and evening walks and in it works well for evenings when going to dinner or moving. Can be worn very casual or a little dressy too. It's great to keep you warm without wearing a thick bulky jacket. This jacket works well for cool weather, but likely not going to keep you toasty warm in truly cold winter (such as pacific north, mid-west, east coast) weather as something heavier would be required. Overall, I would highly recommend this jacket to anyone, you'll enjoy the comfort and learn to love wearing it."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great Fitting Fleece,5,"First I found the colors to be darker than shown but in my case this was a plus. The ever blue on this is much darker (closer to the top color in picture) jacket looks great and is light and warm. I got this to replace my old zip hoodie (never really used the hood) and really like the high collar when zipped all the way up. This has a better fit and less bulky feel than a hoodie, and the sleeves are a great length too. The zippered side pockets are pretty big. Just a great fleece jacket. Very happy with this purchase"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Comfortable fit and right length,5,I wear these while at work as they keep me warm sitting next to the window.  They are soft and comfortable and the size I ordered fits perfectly.  They are well made and keep me warm.  The color is just what I ordered and I am well pleased with them. I bought three of them and am glad I did. You can't go wrong with them.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Soft and Sleek,5,"I wear a 38R in suit jacket size for reference. They Columbia jacket was soft and has reminded soft for a long time, I try not to get it too dirty or have to wash it much as that will obviously hurt fleece.ProThe color is not faded black or charcoal, but a nice DARK black. The Red is also a good blood red.There is pull ties on both sides to make it more snug around your waist if you choose so.The  pockets have zippers and work great and have never jammedConA little bad at blocking wind"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,great jacket!!! Warm and comfortable!,5,"I gave this jacket to my boyfriend for Christmas. I was looking for a jacket that he can wear in the winter and fall or during chilly weather that is light but yet warm and comfy. My boyfriend goes to school in Washington DC but comes home to Ohio during the breaks. When I gave this jacket to him he was completely suprised! The color of the jacket was beautiful. The jacket runs a bit big, I ordered a medium but he likes baggy jackets so he can wear a sweater or hoodie underneath. The jacket is so soft and comfortable! Columbia is a great brand and the price is reasonably affordable. My boyfriend loves this jacket and he can't take it off! Two thumbs up to Columbia!!!!!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Somewhat disappointed,3,"Ordered the size 3X and it fits perfect , but snug. Very surprised by the thin material. Definitely not for men who want warmth and durability. These are more suitable for the subaru driving , Starbucks sipping , Safe Space crowd."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Runs large.,3,"Runs large, sleeves are too loose, so you might want to consider getting a size ""smaller"". An issue that I've always had with Columbia. This will probably be the last time I make an attempt to purchase their product."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Very comfortable as always.,4,"This is my 5th Columbia fleece of one form or another. I've had this one for a few months now and it is just as nice and soft as the rest. Like the top review states, it runs a bit big (midsection is not quite as tapered as the picture shows). This was my only problem. I am a 5'9, 145 lbs and the small was not small enough=\ I have seen a review that says these run small, but I seriously doubt it. Of the 5 I have, only 1 has fit dead on. The other 4 went big. Who's fault is that? - mine!Anyway, I buy them because they are warm, comfortable, and worth it. I would recommend to anyone."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Good product, great value",4,"This is a less expensive fleece jacket or sweater, not meant to keep the wind out.  It is a very good value, with many colors to select from.  At the price, you could buy two!  I found the fight to be about right, loose enough to wear over clothes; I fit L on some shirts/jackets, and XL on others.  I am 220 lbs 71 inches with a 42 inch chest and 38 waist.  I found that since this sweater has no sleeve liners, it can be hard to put on if you are wearing a rough fabric shirt. Overall I like the jacket."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Perfect!,5,"I use this to wear around the house in the winter.  It's not too heavy or too hot, just right.  Lightweight and keeps me at the correct warm temperature that is the most comfortable.  I like the neck and the zipper.  I used the size chart to order and it fits perfectly.  This is actually my second one of these.  The first, I purchased at Kohl's.  Loved it until the puppy chewed up the zipper.  Great price too."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Awesome, warm, light weight",5,"Definitely a little on the large side, but not enough to say it fit somewhat large. It's an outdoor fleece, you need extra room.Anyway, this jacket is an amazingly lightweight, warm, piece of gear. Took it camping in the woods on a 30-something degree night. With a baselayer, a long-sleeve shirt, and this, was warm enough. This thing is awesome.That said, it will NOT keep the wind out. You might as well be wearing nothing when the wind comes through. I mean, it's a fleece, so that's expected, but you definitely need a shell over this."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,make sure you get the color you want,5,"It's very easy to mistake a color with your monitor. I thought the deep forest \ black (kind of a misleading name, although forests bring green to mind it doesn't come right out and say that it is green) was really just a creative way to say black. But it is in fact a very dark GREEN. In some lighting it looks black, but don't be mistaken it is green. Still a great product, I'm keeping it just because it looks nice and it was only 40 with the shipping, great deal. I'll probably order another black one when it's in stock."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Very tight fit compared to my other Columbia Full Zips.,3,"Purchased this item along with 2 other Columbia products from Amazon and for some reason, it is a very tight fit. I am 1.90 tall and my size is XL. The rest of my Columbia fleeces are usually loose enough for me to move comfortably but this product is very tight. I feel as if it was a returned item and the person who had it before did the wrong wash cycle and it must have shrank. I really love the colors of it but don't want to go through the hassle of returning it as I am going to be abroad for the next 3 months and return shipment will cost more than the product is worth."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,The best jacket I've ever owned,5,"The best jacket I've ever owned. Lived in Michigan near the Ohio border and this was the only jacket I used. Wore it in 20 degree weather and felt great. Save yourself $100 and skip North Face. This jacket provides the same thing for a 1/3 of the price. I recommend going with whatever size shirt you wear. Usually I downgrade sizes in jackets, but when I downgraded here it was a little small. Even with that complaint, this jacket is the best."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Very nice jacket but it is little bit thinner than I expected.,4,"I like it because of the nice style and it came at a very nice price. I got the tradewinds grey/graphite color and it looks sweet. However, it does have a con. It is thinner than I expected which means it isn't as warm as I expected. My Puma fleece jacket is thicker and warmer. My Dickies thermal-lined jacket is way warmer and actually costed me less. If they made the Columbia jacket a little bit thicker and warmer, it would have been 5 stars."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Warm and cosy but got an ugly color!,4,"I purchased the womens version of this jacket but it was too tight in the mid section, not a bell shape I guess!! so I got the guys version for some room when sitting around the house. Its a very comfortable and warm jacket but got the tusk/grill color thinking it was light and dark grey opps! oh well ugly but very happy with it as it fits well and is very soft and warm on winter days in a drafty house. The price was a steal on sale for about $20. At that price would buy again but the nicer colors run about $36."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Nice product,5,"Columbia jacket, reliable quality and super soft. I have 3 different colored ones. However this one I returned only because it was a super bright blue and got the dark navy instead."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Great, versatile jacket.  Not too heavy but keeps you warm when it counts!",5,"I love the fit of this jacket, it's my new go-to for cool fall weather, or to layer with heavier winter clothes.  It's breathable enough to where you won't sweat like crazy, but thick enough to keep you warm when it counts.It does fit just slightly larger than expected, which I actually enjoy.  I usually wear an XL t-shirt and I got this jacket in L and it fits perfectly.I originally ordered this in gray because it was at a great sale price, but it ended up being such a light gray (almost powder blue looking) that I decided to pay the difference and exchange for black/silver, which is stylish and universally looks good."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Good Value for Price,4,"This was pretty much as described online.  Glad I ordered the large, the medium would have been too small.  I'm six feet and weigh 185.The fit is snug the way I like it.  Not baggy at all.  This is not a garment for cold days, but should be fine as long as temp is above 40 degrees. I needed something that will endure lots of use for a cheap price and this fits the bill.  The color is lighter that appears online."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,comfortable and roomy,5,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.  He is a big guy; tall and large.  He usually wears a XXL.  Some would consider this zip up a little large, but that is good, so he can wear over his clothes, in replace of a jacket or by itself.  It isn't restricting or tight at all.  In my opinion it fit perfect, the way a man would want a comfy shirt to fit.  If you are looking for something with a tighter, more modern fit.  You need to keep looking.  This is roomy."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,The rooms are cool where the machines are,5,"I bought this jacket for my husband's brother who is on dialysis. The rooms are cool where the machines are, and they need somethingto keep them warm.  This was perfect for him. I also ordered the Louis  L'Amour and Zane Grey  books for him to read while he is taking thedialysis. The Jacket comes in many colors and was a great buy.Thanks,Anita"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Overall good, soft material, but questionable threading at waist.",3,"It lasted about a month and a half before the threading holding the elastic at the waist started to come undone causing the elastic to come out. I was able to repair it myself with a sewing kit, however this does not show well for the build quality control."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Nice fit,5,"Haven't had it long, but perfect for a lite cool temps. I'm a big guy & not used to fitted clothes. This isn't too small, just fitted. Wearing an undershirt & long sleeve shirt, the jacket is perfect. Very smooth texture. High neck when zipped all the way up. Time will tell if the fabric holds up. So far, seems hardy enuff & well made."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Good fit and Great Price,5,I was a bit worried with this fleece jacket becaues of the fitting of the jacket and the quality of the fleece.  The small fits great and I can definitely put some layers underneath it easily.  I haven't washed it yet(yikes) but I hope the fleece doesnt pile up.  Static electricity is an issue on certain windy days but that is expected with almost all jackets of this material.  The color looks identical to the picture.  I will get another jacket in a different color with this quality and price.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Nice lightweight Fleece jacket!,5,"I like this lightweight fleece jacket so much I bought this to replace a similar sized Columbia fleece jacket that I've worn for several years which is starting to show a little wear more from repeated washings over the years.The only odd thing about this one is that the zippers on the pockets zip upwards to close, and downward to open. That's opposite of the dark grey jacket that this one is replacing. Not a big deal, but odd that the zippers were opposite for whatever reason. I still like it and recommend it highly!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"great fit, warm, not to big or small. true to size",5,"this size is great. 4xl , surprisingly smaller then the 3xlt. the 3xlt is huge. the 4xl fits perfect. im 5'10'' 300lb heavy in mid section. hope this helps someone decide.well if your super tall and round i recomend the tall sizes.i thought i was tall but the tall is way big."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great value and I love the rich red color of my new fleece,5,"Love it.  Great fit and I love the rich red color.  When I ordered it, I was slightly concerned that the actual color of the fleece would be a brighter red than I'd prefer, but when I opened my package I was delighted to see a not extremely bright red-colored fleece.  I love the color and the picture on the webpage is very true to the actual color of the fleece.  Great value, too!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Decent Lighter Fleece Jacket,4,"As should be obvious from the price, this is not super-warm technical fleece.  But that was not what I was looking for.  I wanted something lighter, the equivalent of #100 weight Polartec which is available in many shirts and vests.  This fits the bill for that.  Zipper pockets are a nice security touch.  The sleeves are a bit narrow.  I can't speak to durability yet.  But the choice of colors and price for a lightweight fleece jacket make this a good choice for what it is."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Good Fleece, Bad Zipper.",3,"I've always loved Columbia's fleece zip ups. However, lately it seems that the zippers seem to ALWAYS break on them! I thought the first time was due to wear (I wore that thing ALL the time). But the most recent one I purchased lasted about 6 months, and the zipper completely broke apart, and is now stuck halfway up the fleece.I plan on sending it back to Columbia to see if they will honor their warranty policy. Other than the zipper issues, this fleece is by far one of my favorites!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Too cold even at 40F,1,"Michigan, 40F weather, I'm cold with it. And I had a sports hoodie underneath, and I was freezing. Hands in the pockets and they were freezing"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,super soft super nice,5,"I don't usually write reviews but had to do it for this one... super soft super nice, excellent value! the tag says $60 on it which seems a bit high but I  could easily see paying $45+ in an outlet and being happy with it, this feels like a steal. I got the light grey / grey mix which happened to be the cheapest but it looks just fine, kind of like a light blue more than a light grey, but it's good. for $20 you can't go wrong."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Excellent Jacket,5,"Bought this fleece jacket for my trip to New Zealand. First of all the colour combination -  Flame/Charcoal Heather looks very nice. Everyone around me liked it. The material is also thick but soft and has a good feeling to it.  It is also very warm. I had it on me most the days when we were out sightseeing , except when it was very windy or rainy.  I had bought a separate thin and light shell jacket that I wore over it on those occasions. Overall it is a nice quality jacket and I recommend it highly.  The only cons I feel is that it runs slightly larger, probably to accommodate another layer  underneath. For the temperature in NZ when I was there, I did not have to wear anything underneath, so had a slight loose fitting."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Columbia equals excellence.,5,Columbia equals excellence.  This makes my fourth Columbia jacket and they are worth every penny. I have replaced all of my other fleece jackets with Columbias. The color of this is unique and striking. A perfect piece for layering.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Works for tall ladies too!,5,Bought this for myself in medium/pink and I am IN LOVE with it!  I'm a thin 6'0 woman so I wanted a little extra length in the arms and torso and you just don't get that with the woman's sizes without looking like you're wearing something that's way too big for you.  So happy I bought the men's!  It's large enough without looking boxy and it's so soft!!
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Good jacket, good price",5,"Got this jacket for my husband.  He wanted a light-weight fleece to layer with a anorak or other jacket.  It is a great quality for the price, and seems well-constructed.  Zipper pockets are great so keys don't get lost, and open inner pockets are good for light extras like a handkerchief or bags for picking up on a dog walk.  My husband normally wears an XL, and this fits just fine - plenty of room in the shoulders, and down to hips to cover the waist of his jeans.  Definitely a good buy."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Love it!,5,"Have two colors and both fit perfectly.  Light weight fleece for cool days or layering on cold days.  Very handy for three seasons here in the high desert.  Good workmanship and design, I have come to trust Colombia."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Coming apart at the seams,1,"About 3 months after purchase, the stitches that hold the front left panel to the rear panel broke. It is literally coming apart at the seams. I have to send it back to Columbia for repair at my expense, and I have to go without a winter coat in the mean time. This was not a good experience."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Poor Quality, Thin Fleece",2,"I rarely review products but I purchased two of these Columbia Steens Moutain Fleece jackets and was so disappointed that I felt compelled to share. I purchased one Surplus Green fleece and one Collegiate Navy. The Surplus Green was made in China and the Collegiate Navy says made in Haiti. Both fleeces fit well but are much thinner than I expected. I tried wearing both outside and neither are very warm compared to my Nautica Nautex fleece (which I've had for 5 years but is starting to show it). I could even feel the wind through them. The Navy fleece seemed slightly heavier, but just after wearing it 4-5 times, the seam in the left forearm came apart for no apparent reason. I won't be purchasing any more Columbia fleeces nor can I recommend them to anybody else."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Exactly what I wanted!,5,I was looking for a fall/spring full zip fleece.  My college age son thinks hoodies are the only thing to wear.  But I hate pulling off a hoodie and having your hair messed up.  And a hoodie has to much material about your neck.  This fleece was exactly what I was looking for.  Very wearable down into the 30's.  Convenient and comfortable.  Yet- not to warm that it kills you to wear it in the car.  I'm happy with it.  And my wife really likes the color.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Comfortable and durable!,5,"This is a great jacket-it looks nice and my son says it is very comfortable. Not too heavy, not too light. Seems to have held its size/fit after several washings."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Fits amazingly,5,"I have long arms. I am a 15 1/2 x 35 shirt measurement. This fleece fit perfectly. Another interesting tidbit about this shirt, I used it almost all weekend as my warmth layer, hardly using my Columbia rain jacket as a shell, and I was around a campfire for quite a few hours (8+) total. I am amazed at the lack of fire/smoke smell on the fleece. Maybe this is common of polyester clothing and I just don't know it, but I don't think I even need to wash it!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Extremely poor quality.,1,"I’ve only owned this jacket for a week, only worn a few times, and the stitching has already came out towards the bottom where it zips. The whole threading came loose leaving me holes in both pockets. Either Columbia’s quality control has really gone down hill or this is a knock-off. I haven’t even washed this once and it’s falling apart."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,the colors are also very nice. The weight is perfect for these Michigan seasons ...,5,"We bought one of these for my dad, and within a month got another one because the first one needed washed and convincing him to part with the first was difficult (cancer patient who is always cold, plus a stubborn guy to start with). We all felt these are well made and sized ad expected, the colors are also very nice. The weight is perfect for these Michigan seasons too!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Felt Cheated.........,2,"I got this from here and it was 50% off , which is as good as in Belk in store or other instores.But what I felt bad was , the Fleece Jacket was wornout material. It was very clear to see that the Fleece was there lying in the godown for years and colors already got faded.The color or the shine nowhere matches like new as shown in the pic  and that means the colors were already faded.I feel cheated and there is always a return policy, but it is a hassle and the seller knows that and send such faded old fleece Jackets ....But one lesson I learnt from this and that is  "" Unless one can't buy it in Instore, then only buy Online otherwise if the thing you want to buy is available instore don't buy from Online..""In store we know what we are buying, how is the color and how much good it is ......."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Could be manufacturing bad quality. Apart from the fit,3,"At first, I purchased a large (for my 42"" chest). That was a bit baggy, so I reordered Mediums. Why only the 3 stars? Well, there was a discrepancy in fitting between the two Mediums I bought. This Deep Water (Teal) one is definitely tighter than the Charcoal. Could be manufacturing bad quality. Apart from the fit, quite a nice sweater."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Excellent value for a lightweight fleece.,4,"This jacket is an excellent choice for those of us living in milder climates. While I would not wear this in temps below freezing, it is great when temps start getting chilly. The jacket is also excellent for physical activities and resists wear and tear while remaining breathable and warm.The styling is understated and appropriate for any occasion you might wear a fleece."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Second reviewed product here: quit skimping and charging!!!,4,"Ok, this is the second item I have bought that clearly could be cooler looking BUT, they wanted to keep the price down and so did the minimum style they could. Ok, that MIGHT be ok if they DID keep the price down, but they DIDN'T! It's still too much. Now I guess someone used to say: speed, quality, price; pick any TWO. In this case I guess I picked quality construction and name brand but got clobbered on price and style..."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great spring and fall fleece,4,Great fleece.  The only thing that seemed odd was there were not loops at the sleeves and at the neck to connect the fleece under a shell jacket.  I got the red and collegiate blue version.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Fabulous Fleece,5,Very warm and cozy.  Was great to find product came in tall size.  Check the colors some of them dip down in price- for $22 this was a super buy.  I don’t like wearing heavy jackets in the winter and this suits me fine in 30-50 degree weather.  Runs big. I’m 6’3 230 lbs and usually buy XL for length but the LT fits me perfect.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,This jacket is very comfortable and lightweight yet keeps you warm,4,"This jacket is very comfortable and lightweight yet keeps you warm. The zippers on the pockets are handy and the cuff on the sleeves are elastic so it feels snug on the arms. It's great for a chilly day, but might not be the best choice for the coldest weather. I noticed on a particularly windy day that it didn't protect my body completely from the wind. I was able to feel it blowing through my jacket a little."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Perfect for big shoulders,5,"My son is big and we were afraid of a size L but it fitted perfectly!The quality was great!Only thing is that on a trip, the zipper was completely damaged on the first laundry (laundry by the pound) so I recommend to have extra care when washing."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Well proportioned 3xlt.,4,"The size right, especially the length. Not too long but not a short sleeve waist length either. Seems to be what you would expect from Columbia."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Columbia fleece at a good price!,4,"- Columbia brand name- Warm comfortable fleece- Sizing is pretty accurate. I don't love the cut in that I like more mobility, but it looks fine.- I ordered an XL, usually wear an XL or XXL in winter clothes because I like movement as I stated beore, but you will likely be fine with your regular size.- Price tag was almost 50% more than what I paid on amazon- Prime shipping delivered quickly"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great classic,5,"The burgundy color is nice and it's very soft.  Fits well, I am a female that usually wears a women's large because I'm tall.  I like these on me because the arms are long enough.  I ordered a medium."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Let down by mistake,4,Nice product. Bought for a student in need. Ordered and XL but was sent a Large. Disappointed in that because my student needed it before our Thanksgiving break. It was a tad snug but he was so excited about it and said it was fine. I really wish he could have the size he needed. Beware of them sending incorrect size.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great look for staying warm.,5,"Love this look!  They are warm and have style.  They fit baggy for sizing.  There seems to be different qualities to these jackets.  Not sure how that’s happening.  They’re affordable on Amazon, but maybe quality is lower grade of polyester.  Ordering direct from Colombia is more expensive.  The talk is you get a higher quality polyester directly from them."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Comfort & warmth that lasts,5,"Very comfortable and warm. This has been my go to brand for at least 14years for winter & 9yrs for every season! Even though, they last for years-even after, washing & drying & just being hard on them. They hold up!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,fits exactly,5,"My husband lost his red fleece jacket which he liked very much. I looked around town and of course, couldn't find a red one. I found this on Amazon, but some people said it ran big. I ordered my husband's correct size, XL and it fit perfectly, just like the previous XL fleece jacket. It is of good quality, has zipped pockets and is just right for most days in this northern climate."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"A bit small, but a quality jacket",5,"The jacket is made of quality material, but it runs a tad bit smaller than Columbia jackets I've had in the past.  I usually wear a men's medium, but the large was a perfect fit for me in this jacket."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great Jacket for Women Too,5,I bought this as woman because I wanted something more loose to put on over sweatshirt or anything else. It was a great choice as the Women's Columbia fleeces were much too fitted for my taste. These are great for hiking in colder temps or just something to throw on to run errands or go to the gym.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,My favorite garment periodt,5,"Extremely comfortable, very warm. This one was a size too large but I wear the size down I got practically every day"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,not for outdoor,3,"from the reviews, i thought this would be much heavier.  actually, it is more like a fleece tee shirt.  ok to wear around the house, but outside, it is way too light.  columbia makes really nice stuff, but they missed the mark on this one.  i will keep it because it is nice inside, but i need one at least twice the weight for outdoor use"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"High Quality, nice and warm.",5,"I love these Columbia fleece sweaters. I have so many of them. This one is very very nice, dark cherry color."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Warm but looks dull and fits a little too large...,3,"The picture is deceiving being that it contrasts well on there. The one I received was very dull looking. Almost like it was used. Nevertheless, it is warm and comfortable so the utility is there. I purchased a large and I am 5'11"" 185 lbs and it was a little too big for me. Got it for a solid price but would not buy again."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,I Live in This Thing,5,"In the upper NE of US, you learn to layer inside to keep the heating bill down. Used to use hoodies and sweatshirts, but was always still cold. Found out sweatshirt material kind of stinks when it comes to really keeping you warm.This thing keeps me warm no matter what, so I can continue living where people are not meant to live."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Look and fit excellent but ....,3,"... the pockets are lined with a differently textured material that is unpleasantly scratchy.  Instead of the same soft fleece feel, one is surprised with a material that catches on every bump  and imperfection on your hands.  Maybe a wash or two will even things out.  If not, we're thinking of adding a lining since the rest of the jacket is so good and a cut above typical fleece."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,This jacket is very warm and comfortable. My husband's hips are two sizes smaller than ...,5,"This jacket is very warm and comfortable.My husband's hips are two sizes smaller than his chest, so jackets usually are too roomy around the hips. This jacket is stretchy and fits my husband's body very well.I returned the red element jacket and got another color because we both thought that the red looked like women's jacket."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great quality.,5,"These are my husband's absolute favorite. When he wore his old one to death I bought this one. He was worried they would have changed some of the features he really likes (like the quality, weight, or pockets) but it is the same great product as alwasy. Thank you for making him so happy!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Lightweight and comfortable,4,"Comfortable and not too thick a fleece. Other reviews said they seemed to fit larger than their stated size. I didn't find this to be the case, in fact quite the opposite(ordered an XL when an XXL would have been a better fit across my shoulders). Still overall a nice jacket, and it fits well under my rain jacket for when I need an extra layer of warmth."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great Fleece,5,Just what I wanted to replace an old worn similar one.  What a great light jacket.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Poorly made,1,"Bought this jacket for my son for Christmas. He loved until today when I took it out of washer and the draw string at bottom of jacket is totally hanging out because entire seam came undone. I checked and “return window is closed on the item,” so I guess we’re stuck with it..."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,My favorite piece of clothing!,5,"This is a piece of clothing that I probably use more than any other. It's super comfortable and great for a bit of variation of temperature because of the full zipper. I've got three right now. This for comfort, utility, and style is hard to beat. Never static as well."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,very comfortable,5,nice soft and warm jacket for cool mornings and evenings and great to wear under a down coat when it is cold. i liked it so much i bought 3 in different colors.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,The jacket is very comfortable,5,"I liked everything except that the sleeves at the wrist are a bit tight.  However, it probably helps to keep warm in a wind, but harder to read your watch."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,High quality medium to heavy fleece with a very soft finish.  I love it!,5,This is a great fleece jacket.  It looks great and it feels great!  I highly recommend it.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Love it! I am slim,5,"Love it!I am slim, wide shoulder and long arms and normally I go with xlI read the reviews and choose to go for LDamn... perfect fit :)Love the soft feel of the fleece and it's just to keep me comfortable at chilly nightsGood job Columbia"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Love!,5,My boyfriend loves this jacket! He is 5’7” and a medium fits him perfectly. He likes this jacket because it’s not too light but not too heavy and is a great layer for working out in the warehouse and dock
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Jacket is great.,5,"These jackets are great. A very good alternative if you don't want to buy a North Face. Plus the name, Columbia, sounds fancy. Silly to say, but it's the truth. And I'd rather spend $30 instead of $165 to get the same thing, personally. They are light weight, easily washable, etc. A great jacket for most all weather, unless you live in like, the Yukon or something."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,but I guess that is a good feature to stand out in a crowd or to ...,5,"The color of the garment was quite a bit more electric than we thought when ordering, but I guess that is a good feature to stand out in a crowd or to be able to find your coat in a bundle of other coats with ease.  The fit was fine and the strength and sturdiness of the zippers seem like they will stand up to use by the teenager it was intended for."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,You’re not getting the product you’ve paid for!,1,"I’ve been wearing this fleece for years and I’m more than happy with the product. It’s very comfortable, durable and functional. However, this time I got a different color than the one I bought. I’m uploading both pictures, what I bought and what I got! Please find the differences! That was nothing but a disappointment."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,fleece jacket,5,This is a tall size large fleece jacket.  It fits my husband who is long in the torso.  It is great for cool days.  Comfy and soft.  It's what I expect from Columbia.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Warm and toasty,5,"This fleece is super warm and I love that I can zip it up all the way to cover my neck and it's not too tight. I know Amazon prices fluctuate all the time, but I only paid $15 and feel like I got a steal. It's worth 2x that easy."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,First time owner,5,Love the Columbia jacket. First one that I ever owned. It won’t be the last.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great comfort and color!  A little more snug than I thought it would be.,5,"I had a XXL Columbia fleece and it was a bit baggy on me, so I got the XL in this.  Love the color and the weight of the jacket and it is very soft and comfortable.  It feels, a little snug, but overall, I really like it.  Don't know if I would order the XXL or XL if I had it to do all over again, but I would definitely buy this jacket again."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Second jacket, different color",5,"Great jacket and super comfortable.  This is my second jacket, I got this one to wear about town and not while working around the house.  They are soft, super warm, the perfect coat to wear around in the house during the coldest winter months and stay toasty warm, or outside when a warm but light coat is needed.  It's also well made and fits well.  I am 6'2"" tall and 42"" chest and the large fits me perfect and not too tight, easy to move and bend.I love this Columbia jacket."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Fits to true size,5,This jacket fit great it was well made. I was very happy with it. This was my second order of a Columbia jacket.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Good coloration and warm.,4,"One sleeve came from Amazon partially un-sewn on the inside but otherwise it works great. It is nice and warm and as expected from Columbia. This is warm but not great for wind as the wind will cut right through it. So you may need something as a top layer to protect against wind or rain, but as fleece it is great."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Colors are not what is shown,3,Like the fleece style and fit just fine.  I was sent a totally different color than pictured three times to didn’t end up keeping the blue one.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Nice warm, and yet light weight Jacket.",5,"Fits great as suspected. It's just right for Wisconsin weather during early spring and fall. I purchased to replace an older fleece jacket on which the zipper tab had broken. It was a great choice at an excellent price. There were many other color choices, but I chose the color most close to the older jacket that I was replacing."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Seems a little big,4,"I really like this fleece! It's a little bigger or less fitted than I expected, but I am always somewhere between a men's large and men's medium. The arms are long enough on the large, but the chest seems a little big. If I was buying this in a store, I probably would have agonized between the large and the medium and then chose the large."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,It's just what I wanted!,5,"I love this fleece jacket! The price was very reasonable & was just what I was looking for. Loved it so much, I purchased another one in a different color. It's very lightweight, but, keeps me toasty & warm. No disappointments here."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Disappointing,1,The one I got looks nothing like the product image. It is 5 shades lighter. I have the same one in black and it looks like the Image advertised. Also it fits me like an XL when I ordered a medium. Will not order from this seller again.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Decent jacket but too big,3,I wanted this as a daily wearer to work but it was too large - and I got the small! Tried to shrink it and it wont - so I guess for some thats a plus. Not for me. Poo. If I could return it I would. Color is good and quality is good (it is Columbia) but the size was too large.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Red Rust is mostly Rust, lol",4,"It was exactly what it said it would be. It was definitely a bit more orange than I had anticipated. I was hoping for more of a red color, but it still works!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Love it,5,Love my purchase
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Good quality product,5,We buy one of these for our son every few years.  They are warm and comfy though after 2-3 years of heavy wear they start looking a bit worn.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Perfect!,5,As usual just Columbia jacket did not disappoint. It fits as expected it is a great layering piece or enough to wear outside on chilly days.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Worth the buy!,5,"Exactly what I was looking for, but the color was a little off.  I thought red element was more burgandy, but it was a bit on the pale side.  I would definitely buy another for the price.  It not thick, I can put a T-shirt under this and that would get me through Fall no problem."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Columbia is a great brand. I consider a Columbia fleece to be ...,5,"Columbia is a great brand. I consider a Columbia fleece to be an important part of any wardrobe.  This is warm, soft, and washable. The zipper is very sturdy and the pockets are deep. My boyfriend loved it."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,This is a great jacket.,5,"This jacket is great. It's very warm, without being overly so. Perfect for spring and fall, or to layer under a windbreaker. It doesn't block wind at all, but that's just a fact of life when you're talking about fleece jackets, so I don't think that's a point against this particular product. It's a pretty close-fitting jacket, it doesn't feel tight or too small, but it's definitely not bulky. It's very easy to wear a raincoat over it."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great product!,5,Really great polar fleece. You can never go wrong when you order a Columbia product. My husband asked for this for Christmas and was very pleased when he got it. This runs true to size. Definitely worth the price and the delivery was a little faster than anticipated. Thanks amazon for bringing good products to your site.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"great look, value, and fit for tall and lean young men - size large",5,"The jacket looked great, and the size was perfect for my son. My son is 6' 1"" and has long arms. It would probably be a medium tall is I could find such a thing in most things, but large with a more fitted cut worked perfectly in this Columbia men's Steen's mountain full zip 2.0. it was a great price too."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Nice basic lightweight fleece jacket,4,"This is just fine as a basic jacket for indoors in the depth of winter and outdoors spring/fall. The fabric doesn't seem quite as high quality as the one we bought three years ago, but it's perfectly adequate. Very good fit on the large. Doesn't have any weird insets or stuff that make it look like something for the ski slope — that's a plus."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Seems like the sizes run small,3,The sizing doesn't seem right. I bought a similar type fleece jacket at target in a 2XL and I was swimming in it. I bought this one in a 2XL and it's really tight. The jacket seems nicely made though. I guess it gives me a good reason to try and shed some pounds... Especially after the holidays!
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,NICE PRODUCT,4,"I may have needed one size larger, not sure. The product looks well made and I like it.The only thing I have a problem with are the sleeves, they feel to snug around the wrist and lower part of my arm."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Exactly what I expected,5,"Great price, great quality, well packaged."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,VERY SOFT,5,"Very soft.  I bought it to replace a Lands End fleece from several years ago.  I wear them almost daily. I finally wore the other one out.  This new one is so soft i worry that it won't hold up long term.  But it is great so far.  The green color is perfect.  XL Fit is perfect for my taste. I like it a little loose and long arms.  6' 3"" 205lbs. Any smaller than me, i would go with L."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Great product but add 2 pieces of Velcro for inside pockets,5,Fit perfectly and true to size. Light but warm. Not clumsy. Just the way I like it. The fleece is tops. There are two inside pockets. They are largecwhich inlike but no zipper or snap. I'm adding my own sticky Velcro closures. Columbia makes a great product.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Super soft and warm,5,"This is the most comfortable fleece jacket I've ever owned. It fit perfectly, is machine washable, and is my go to jacket for everything from hiking to working on the computer. LOVE IT!"
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Warm and quite,5,"This fits perfectly. How ever I don't recommend putting it in the dryer. It's a lay it out to dry kind of shirt. I have another one of these in a 2XL Tall and after the dryer it shrunk down to the size of this one, a 2XL. Good thing it still fits because I like these a lot, there nice and warm and quite for that extra layer for hunting."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Great look, fit & quality",5,"The jacket quality is great, fits as expected,  colors were as stated & was received quickly.

Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Nice and warm,5,"I've had this for almost 3 years and it still looks just like new! It's not like I take great care of it, but its held pretty well all this time."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,nice jacket for the price,5,"I have an older Columbia brand Fleece jacket.  It has worn and held up well.  Their jackets seem to run a little large, but if you want to put on something bulkier underneath to dress in layers, this works well.  I tried another name brand, and it was tight.  This is preferable to me, and the price is a lot lower than other brands."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Feels like a warm hug,5,My wife stole all my fleece jackets. If I'm not careful I think she's gonna steal this one too. I love this jacket.
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,New favorite jacket,5,"I really love the Navy/Blue color on this jacket, and it keeps you warm! It's very comfortable and has pockets both on the inside and outside, and the outside ones have zippers so your stuff won't fall out.

Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,The pocket lining catches your skin and feels awful. ...,1,"The pocket lining catches your skin and feels awful. And it was definitely on the large side, so did not fit me well at all."

Excellent buy , will definitely buy again in different color...."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,Fantastic fleece,5,Perfect for those chilly days indoors when you don't want to turn up the heat.  Warm enough for a round of golf.  Like the longer style with no elastic around the waist to bunch up.  Very soft for the ladies.  Very nice rust color - not a bright red.  Arrived right on time.  Can't go wrong with Columbia.

Columbia Men's Steens Mountain Full Zip 2.0 Soft Fleece Jacket,"Excellent Light weight ""jacket"" for the Fall season",5,"I've been searching for an inexpensive light weight ""jacket"" to wear for the fall season,  this was perfect,  I did NOT want a Hooded product such as a sweat shirt. and this looks and feels great and is warm.

TBMPOY Men's Windproof Bomber Jackets Lightweight Running Windbreaker Outdoor Golf Fashion Coat,Nice Jacket But...,4,"This TBMPOY bomber style jacket fits me like a glove in size L and I’m just over 6-feet tall and about 180 pounds. Looks great too. I feel cooler wearing it...ha. It would suit me fine on a fall or spring day. The zippered pocket on the upper left sleeve is super cool and I was surprised that i could fit my Big Skinny bi-fold wallet in there. I really dig the style. There are a few issues that bug me, however: First, the product description stated that the outer material is nylon (company has since updated product info), when it is in fact polyester. False advertising and disappointing, because the main reason why I picked this jacket over the million other bomber-style coats listed on Amazon is because of the advertised nylon outer shell that I thought I would be receiving. Second, the zippers aren’t smooth at all, feel rather cheap. Third, there’s loose threads here and there and this makes me question how durable this thing will be for daily wear. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a nice-looking jacket but it doesn’t seem particularly high quality. Not hating, just my initial impression. Another issue I have with the jacket is the cheesy message on the inside tag worded in broken English, and finally, the odd choice to use the word “ingredients” for the fabrics tag. 🤦‍♂️ It all just screams foreign-made good. You’d figure TBMPOY would at least get the language and verbiage of the market they were selling their product in correct. Just seems lazy on the company’s part. Still like the jacket though, but it’s a 3.5 stars for me."
TBMPOY Men's Windproof Bomber Jackets Lightweight Running Windbreaker Outdoor Golf Fashion Coat,Fabric is stiff!!!,3,"I didn’t care for the fabric used to make the jacket. It had as stiff, synthetic feel that just didn’t feel good."
TBMPOY Men's Windproof Bomber Jackets Lightweight Running Windbreaker Outdoor Golf Fashion Coat,poor quality material,2,"The jacket is made of hard nylon having poor flexibility. And, for me the size is slightly small in the body."
TBMPOY Men's Windproof Bomber Jackets Lightweight Running Windbreaker Outdoor Golf Fashion Coat,Not what I expected,2,Quality is a bit on the skimpy side for this price. Ordered a medium but chest and armpits are too cramped. Did not want to bother with a return. Gave it away to a smaller co-worker. Next time I will go to a department store to try out before purchasing.
TBMPOY Men's Windproof Bomber Jackets Lightweight Running Windbreaker Outdoor Golf Fashion Coat,The New “Members Only” jacket,5,Fits just right.  Reminds me of the old “members only” jackets from back in the day. Can’t beat the price.  I was looking for something to wear when the weather is wet!! This seems to do the trick.
TBMPOY Men's Windproof Bomber Jackets Lightweight Running Windbreaker Outdoor Golf Fashion Coat,Husband likes color and comfort,5,My husband really likes his jackets.  But he has long arms so the sleeves come above his wrists.  He used to that issue.
TBMPOY Men's Windproof Bomber Jackets Lightweight Running Windbreaker Outdoor Golf Fashion Coat,""" MORE THAN I EXPECTED """,5,"Great jacket, I was expecting something a little less quality and ugly.

TBMPOY Men's Windproof Bomber Jackets Lightweight Running Windbreaker Outdoor Golf Fashion Coat,"Very nice, runs small",5,"Very nice jacket, good quality and very attractive.

OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Excellent price, actually waterproof, lightweight, functional and comfy.",5,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   Great coat. Lightweight and actually waterproof. Water lands on it, but the coat does not get wet. Zero soak. I love it. It has taken me years to find a waterproof coat in my price range. I’m a preschool teacher, so I can’t affoard gortex. But this was like $20? And I can take it to work every day, and if the weather decides to rain and I have to take the kids outside, it really makes it so much more bearable.  Love it."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Actually pretty good.,5,"I ordered an XL thinking that it would run small, but it’s actually a little roomy on me. The waterproofing seems very well done. Ample pocket space for whatever dumb things I feel like carrying.Addendum: I wore it fishing, wading in the rain, and I stayed plenty dry and warm with this on."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,NOT WATERPROOF,1,"I wanted to like this jacket, I'm tall and have long arms, usually things are too short for me in the sleeves but this fit great, little short on the tail end for a raincoat but it was acceptable.Love the color, it's actually neon or fluorescent green as opposed to yellow which is typically mislabeled but this is actually green.It is not however, waterproof.  I thought the weak link was going to be in the way the hood zips off the jacket, which is in fact one area of leakage I believe, however, if you look at the photos you'll see it also seems to leak where the seams are around the shoulder blades as well.I was out in pouring rain for about 8-10 minutes, it's less than two months old, I'm sad it doesn't work, looks really cool  but not waterproof I'm afraid."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Good Jacket to wear over warm clothes,5,"A great rain coat for the price. Beware, however... As the description states this is a ""shell"" type of jacket. The lining inside this jacket is not intended for warmth but to keep the rain from soaking through. And let me tell you...it DOES a great job of doing that! I bought this in an XL to wear over a sweatshirt, and it does that perfectly!"
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Poor cuff closure design.,3,I'm 5'9 165lbs and I ordered a medium. It fits me well. I wear it while I power wash on cooler days and have stayed dry so far after a few uses. What drives me crazy is the sleeve closure design. I have an average or greater than average sized wrist and the placement of the Velcro is very poorly designed. See attached photo. I'm going to ask my wife if she can fix the issue so I don't have to go through the troubles of returning the jacket. If they could just either add more Velcro or move the current piece I would've given 5 stars for the price I  paid. The jacket allows room for layering and plenty of room in the sleeves.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Nice lightweight jacket,5,"Seems like a decent lightweight jacket. Wouldn't keep you warm but light enough that you could bundle layers of clothing underneath if needed. My son liked it, not sure how waterproof it really is.I wanted to replicate a typical Florida rain storm so I pushed my son in the pool wearing it and his clothes were soaked when he climbed out"
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Twice As Good,5,"I purchased one of these in dark grey, liked it so much that I bought another one, this time the black camo.While the sleeves are ridiculously long, better that than too short, and they can be tightened to preference with the velcro strips at each wrist.I usually wear a Large, but ordered the Medium and am glad I did.  It's a little tight across the midsection (my diet?) but other than that the Large would have been too bulky and even longer in the sleeves.I really like the quality of construction and the attention to the little things that make this jacket work for me.One of those things are the deep, zippered, side pockets.  When I insert my man-sized hands into them, they easily cover well above my wrists.  The interior breast pocket is also zippered, and large enough for the few things (like masks) that I use them for.The entire interior of the jacket is lined and breaths very nicely.  The jacket is light, the hood removes easily, and it can be zippered all the way up under the chin, or loosely closed with several well-placed velcro strips down the front of the jacket.I can attest to the jacket being wind-resistant, but haven't really given it a downpour to test it's waterproofing or lack thereof.  I wanted something light, comfortable, durable, and warm with the right layering and this jacket hit all of those marks.It's also a little longer overall, which is good thing for backside coverage.If these are really waterproof, I will be totally pleased.  No matter what, I'm satisfied."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great Rain Jacket (5 Stars) - Weird Wrist Strap (-1 Star),4,"X-Large clothing can be tight or loose on me, so I chose to get the X-Large size jacket. It has a little more room than normal and the sleeves are a little on the long side (I have short arms). So, true to size is correct.The only issue that I have found, so far, is the weird wrist strap. The weird velcro strip and the anchor strip location is not good for a normal size wrist. If your wrists are as wide as your bicep, then there is no problem. Somebody else also mentioned the weird wrist straps, so it seems to be a production thing. Fix that weird design and it gets 5 stars."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Just What the Doctor Ordered 5,5,This was perfect to block the wind as I rode downhill along side of a mountain.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Very Good Jacket for Coaches on Rainy and Windy Days,5,"This jacket blocks rain and/or wind very well. Half the battle of staying warm is to have the wind blocked and to not get drenched by rain. This jacket does very well in allowing you to stay warm.There are a number of zippered pockets that are helpful if you like to keep certain items grouped together, or keep certain items separated.The hood is a nice feature - it is not some kind of magical hood, but it is waterproof.  Don't go thinking that the hood eliminates water or wind problems for the head. The hood is not adjustable, and does not have any kind of adjustment means to keep it snug around your head.  So if you are required to be facing into the wind because you are watching a game, the hood will come right off your head like a kite.The jacket does not breathe. Heat or water vapor does not magically vent through wonderful microscopic holes. You can get hot in the jacket if you wear it for too long. So you will need to periodically use a low tech solution - unzip the jacket and flap it a few times to release the heat, and then rezip the jacket. Yes, you did pay $35 for the jacket, and no, you did not pay an extra $200 for the magic fabric that invisibly vents heat and water vapor.If you can't adjust the wrist cuff diameter, the cuff flaps around and lets the cold air shoot up the inside of the jacket, from the wrist all the way up the sleeve. So most people will end up sticking their hands in the jacket pockets, but not realize that this is because their cuff is scooping cold wet air up the arm, and this is because their wrist cuffs are not adjustable. LOL! Anyway, there is an absolutely cheap a** adjustment strap at wrist cuff so you can tighten the cuff at the wrist.  It is a horribly cheap, and cheap looking, yet awesome feature."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Not waterproof like it says,1,This jacket says water proof and my husband wore it yesterday for work and it rained . He works outside and the jacket was wet through to the inside and still wet when he got home 8 hours later. Disappointed bec we missed the return window but it doesn’t rain often in southern California . Stuck now... maybe I can spray it with waterproofing and give it another try?
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Hose Me Down!,5,"I’ve purchased 2 jackets that claim they’re waterproof and they are not. Where as the OTU light men’s jacket has been. I purchased it mainly to wear on my scooter and chose the red color so I’d easily be seen. It fits very well (I ordered the men’s medium) and it has some great pockets to store my phone, glasses and mask. It also folds up compactly to store under my scooter seat compartment. But most of all it’s waterproof without being a heavy stiff “rubber ducky style” jacket. The first thing I did when I tried it on was turn the garden hose on myself and it kept me dry!I would be a repeat buyer for this products."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Nicer than expected,5,"I fly fish and regularly go out on cloudy, rainy days. Recently we moved to a temporary residence and had to put much of our belongings in storage until our new house is built. Stupidly, I forgot to set aside one of my 3 other rain jackets and found myself searching Amazon for a low cost alternative to tide me over (really, who needs 4 rain jackets?) . I didn't know the brand OTU but the reviews on this jacket were good, I fell in love with the grey camo color and so took a flyer on this one. I have to say I was impressed with the construction and quality, especially for the price. I would classify this as a medium weight rain jacket, it will protect from wind and rain and form an insulating layer. I have two that are much lighter and pack down much smaller, I have another guide jacket that is somewhat heavier. This slots right between them in terms of weight and bulk. The materials are high quality as is the stitching. The hood and collar (neck gaiter) are well designed and there is enough ease in it to fit over my waders. I am very pleased with this purchase."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Versatile and stylish,5,"My son loves this jacket. He is 13 years old, tall and slim. The medium fits him great with a little room to grow. He wore it in the snow with a warm hoody under, he wore it in early spring with a long sleeve tee, and now as the weather is warming up a bit he wears it with just a tee.It looks great on him as well. The gray, black white camo matches with most if his clothes.Very happy with this purchase"
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,A good light waterproof jacket.,5,"Got soaked going to work the other day. Really fundamentally drenched. I usually walk to work, and this particular day, my weather app said it wouldn't start raining until after I got up the hill to my place of occupation. I don't know why I trusted that thing since it was spitting when I left.Nevertheless, I got drenched, as I said. I don't carry an umbrella, as this wouldn't have helped me, anyway. It was also blowing up a mess and my umbrella would have been yanked inside out. Fat lot of good that would do. So when I got to work and dried off a bit, I decided to get myself a rain jacket. Now, this all happened in July, so I didn't want something heavy or that was gonna make me sweat. (I had a set of what they used to call ""thunderwear"" for on a motorcycle, so you could stay dry on a long trip, and I used those for a long time, but they were nightmarishly hot to wear in humid weather.I got this jacket and I ordered my typical size (XL). I'm 6'3"" and about 200lbs, with longer arms and I usually wear a large in a jacket, if I can try it on in the store. However, with online shopping I always err on the side of a size bigger, because you can never tell and you can always wear a sweater or other jacket under it as the weather cools off.This was a big jacket. I might have been okay with a large, but I'm happy for the XL. The sleeves are long, the jacket covers my butt and the detachable hood is very voluminous. Essentially, if you're looking for something that you can wear in the heat or the cool, this will do you good service, so long as you're willing to wear your winter sweater under it once it gets cold.The other good aspect of this larger size is that I can wear it over my backpack and keep it dry as well without sacrificing coverage elsewhere. I can still sip it up, etc.Of course, just like when you wash the car and it rains immediately, when you buy a raincoat, it will never rain again...Luckily there's a tropical depression overhead and I took it out in the rain the other day, just to see how it does and I'm telling you now, this isn't a water resistant piece of material. It is absolutely *waterproof*, FULL STOP. The material just beads the water and it goes running off and it and you stay dry as if it wasn't sloshing down. Seriously, this is great stuff. You will not get wet.However, the only slight issue is the ""hook and loop"" (we call this velcro—with a small v—) closures at the wrists DO get a little damp, so just be aware of that, but that's not going to keep you from enjoying a rainy walk to work or a day on the trail so long as your boots keep your feet dry and you don't go out in the lightning."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Raindrops Are Falling On My Head,5,"I bought this just in time for spring weather in Wisconsin. I’m a 6’1” female and love the length of this coat as well as the sleeve length. I like how lightweight it is...the color I chose, the fact it’s keeping me dry, the zippered pockets, the velcro placement. Heck...I like the whole jacket including the price tag and am considering buying another one in red."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great jacket,5,Great water resistant and lightweight windbreaker as well. Like 2 for one. If your looking then buy this. Its the one
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Nice jacket,5,"Very lightweight and packable. This jacket came in handy hiking the very wet Mist Trail at Yosemite National Park. Cut is very loose fitting, I ordered a size smaller than my normal jacket size and it fits perfectly. Blue color is great, it’s a dark navy and not too bright. This jacket is Good for Spring/fall hiking"
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,For light rain only.  Extremely disappointed in this 'rain' jacket.,1,The fit of the jacket is as advertised which I was initially worried about.  I wore this jacket in light rain a couple times and it performed fine although I wasn't outside for that long.  The disappointing part is in moderate to heavy rain your upper back and shoulders will be soaked if outside more than 2 minutes.  For what's advertised as a rain jacket that just seems misleading.  I wish I could return it but it's outside the window of return.  Oh well.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,GREAT PRODUCT -- BUT,5,"Bought 2 of these, one for the wife (S) and one for me (L).  These are great.  They are lightweight, flexible, and soft.  And yes, they are water repellant-- as we have used them.  They look and feel like a light jacket.  The only con is:  The sleeves are gimoungousely long!  The (S) the sleeves are about 2 inches longer than normal  and on mine (L) they are are about 5 inches too long.  Why they make them like that??  Took them to a tailor and he shortened the sleeves to the proper length.  Now, we both love these coats.  Can be used even if its not raining as a simple jacket."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Loved it,5,"Purchased for a hiking trip of the 5 nat'l parks in Utah.  Needed something light for my pack in case of rain.I ended up wearing this jacket even when it wasn't raining.  I treated it more as an outer shell while layered underneath.  Temps were in the high 20's and low 30's most of the time.  It cut down a lot of the wind, but not all of it, which I didn't expect it to.  The jacket is vented and let in some breezes but that is to be expected.  The jacket helped release the heat from my body when it wasn't raining.The hood fit is probably my biggest disappointment.  It seemed a bit too big.  But it came in handy when I did encounter rain.  It's removable, but I just allowed it to flop around behind me when not in use.I've had Columbia shells before and I think they're too sloppy.  This had a nice fit.  The 'slimming' black color had me looking good in all the pictures my wife took.Considering buying another one in another color."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Jacket is Waterproof,5,"I just spent a day outside at the range with an all day drizzle and cold front that came in. After four hours I was dry from the rain and warm from the front. Jacket is light weight and works a described. The jacket runs a little smaller than the chart so I would order the next size up,, especially if you have bulky clothing underneath. Not a big deal here in Florida as I only had a 'T' shirt on underneath the jacket."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Dry As A Bone,5,"After years of braving the elements in cotton hoodies, I decided to smarten up and buy an actual rain coat. This jacket is lightweight but has a nice liner inside to help keep you warm on cool, rainy days. This won't keep you totally warm but fits into the ""windbreaker"" category of jackets. The hood is nice and big to keep us large-headed individuals dry and there are adjustable wrists at the end of the sleeves to help you stay dry. One feature that I was surprised about was that as you zip up the jacket, the Velcro patches catch to make sure you're all bundled up and ready for a slight drizzle or a potential downpour."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,He Loves It!,5,"My husband loves this jacket. We got one size larger because he likes a little extra room, and the fit was perfect. The jacket is definitely made well and water resistant. We would totally recommend."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Its a keeper,5,"Fit perfect 6'6"" 170lbs nice long arms, most are to short. Plenty of body length, doesnt hike up in the back, extra room inside for layering, excellant material and construction. Funky plastic strap for the wrist velcro tho. Will have to wait for it to rain in arizona to test water proof tho, that could be awhile lol. Over all very nice like the mesh lining keeps you seperated from the shell. Xxl"
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Nice, too large, not what I was looking for",4,"This is a nice rain jacket, solid build and looks protective. I didn't get to wear it in rain, because it was *way* too large. I am 5' 11"" at 195 pounds and ordered an XL, which is often the size I need, but this seems to be on the large side. An L would have sufficed.More importantly, this is NOT a lightweight jacket by any means, it is quite thick and also warm. Good for transition weather, but not for summer rains. Much too warm and too heavy (more than a pound), also doesn't pack small enough to be stowed away."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Good materials but problematic hood attachment design.,3,Good external material and comfortable interior material. The only potential problem is the way the hood zipper is attached directly to the jacket instead an external part of the jacket. This could allow water inside the jacket. A previous buyer has highlighted this and because of that I did a thorough inspection of this issue.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,I have zero complaints!,5,"I'm 6'1, athletic build, 215 pounds and ordered a L, which fit perfectly. The hem on the jacket hits just right, and not too long like a lot of jackets. I couldn't believe I could actually see rain beading up on my jacket. Pretty cool. It is super lightweight and truly is a shell jacket, which is perfect, as it's function for me is a spring/summer raincoat, as I tend to wear a t-shirt underneath. I have a huge noggin and the hat portion of it actually covers my head. I try not to write reviews until I've lived with a product for a while and I gotta say, this one is a winner."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Nice light weight jacket,5,"Jacket fit well, plenty of room without oversized in the arms or length of jacket. Nice features such as Velcro closures along with zippers. Nice sized pockets, hood. Seems to be wind proof, haven’t done a beach walk yet, hubby said he stayed plenty warm at 60 degrees. Nice jacket no negatives at this time."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Beautiful Jacket But A Poor Hood,4,"The jacket, which I purchased in red, is really beautiful. Seems to be of good quality, substantial fabric. Can't speak to waterproofness yet, but will update if keeping the jacket. The hood is a poor design. Flops over your eyes, and the Velcro closures are a pain, never line up right. Snaps would have been better.Update 4/1/21Stood out in a downpour for about 10 minutes, stayed dry. Would it keep you dry out in a downpour for hours ? Probably not, but then again it's not a $100+ GoreTex jacket.Some have commented that the sleeves are too long. I find that a positive, as you can tuck your hands into the sleeves if it's chilly. The sleeves are easily adjustable with the Velcro straps.The fabric also has a nice texture to it.Bottom line, love the jacket. Quality product for the price."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Fits almost perfect,4,"I've not had a chance to wear it in the rain.  Hopefully soon?  So can't attest to its waterproofing. I've tried it on and fits almost perfect.  Sleaves are just a bit long and it is slightly baggy.  I'm fine with this as I plan to wear it over other clothes/jackets. As you see below, I'm 6'5"" and just over 250.  BIG GUY.  Hope this helps others to find the right fit."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Well worth the money,5,My wife and I are newly married. We like to dress up a lot with the same color clothes. We needed something that would be really good for the rain and also to keep the wind off the both of us. I feel since we have purchased these two jackets they’ve been extremely good to us. Also what I like about it is the color sticks out so if we’re out at night people can’t miss us.We are both in love with this type of jacket that we have now. I would also recommend it to anyone who is thinking about purchasing it.It’s well worth the money and also the investment. Well worth the money. I will add oh one more thing the jackets are very comfortable and they also fit perfect for us.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great deal,5,I have not put it to the full test yet but it seems like really good quality for the price. Take note that this is not an insulated jacket but it will block the wind and it fits over other clothing easily.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Fits great,5,"I wanted something that I knew my husband would not take lol, and he has yet to take this jacket. I like my jackets big. I got the largest size since I’m a woman and bigger up top."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Good looking, affordable and waterproof",5,"So far so good. For the price, I’m extremely happy, and think it compares to more expensive, less waterproof jackets I’ve had. The zippers work well and the inside pocket keeps everything in it perfectly dry."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,This Is Worth The Money,5,"I'm 5'-5"" and 145 lbs. This jacket is almost a perfect fit for me. It's fitted and not baggy like my old rain jacket. The sleeves are a bit long but the Velcro wrist straps take care of that. It's lightweight and definitely rainproof. The detachable drawstring hood and Velcro neck collar really protect my head, face, and neck from exposure. The inner net-like lining separates my body from the jacket shell and keeps me cool and not sweaty. Would buy it again."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great,5,"Great jacket for the money. Time will tell if the zippers hold up. At 6’2” and 175lbs, I am happy with the fit of the medium size, although the sleeves are just a tad long for my taste. The hood zips off and goes back on with ease. The dark grey color will match most if not all of my attire, and the material doesn’t feel or look like you’re wearing a trash bag. As for water resistance, I have not been in a downpour yet, but my water bottle did spill a bit, and the water beaded and ran right off."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Nice looking jacket, just not for freezing temps",4,Very nice jacket for the price. But has no insulation so if your looking for something to keep you warm in freezing temps you may look elsewhere or this jacket would be great as an outside layer. When it's cold I'll put a sweater or jacket underneath this one and then the cold is tolerable. But nice fitment no complaints there
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Love it,5,It’s comfortable and made from great material it’s not too warm which is good though because rain coats usually get you all sweaty. I use it for work but it would be great to wear for everyday life
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Dumb Hood,3,I would have given this jacket a much higher rating if not for the hood. The hood is huge and even with the adjustment strings it slides down over my eyes.  Also the rain flap on its attachment zipper stupidly faces UP so water can run down into it and onto your neck. Really thoughtless design.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Nice jacket; pleasantly surprised.,5,"I was hesitant to buy this as a few of the reviews said this was Chinese sized. I wear a. US 2xl so that's what I ordered. I was pleasantly surprised it fit so well with plenty of room to move freely in it.It's not designed for warmth so it would be great in the summer on a windy rainy day but you won't burn up in it either.All in all, it's a really nice jacket and I highly recommend.Will update after using it for a bit."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great Shell,5,"I needed a new shell for hiking the AT and saw this.  Wow what great quality.  Fits perfect as I wanted some room to wear layers underneath.  I am 5' 10"" and weigh 225lbs.  The XL was just the right size for this.  One inside the coat pocket about 5 in by 6 inches and seals.  lining is great and the hood is removable.  The only thing missing is a carrying pouch or bag to stow it in, otherwise it's a great coat."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"The coat is beautifully made, but the arm length is waaay tooo long",4,"Like I said, it's well made and it looks good when you put in on, except for the arm length.I am trying to figure out how to shorten it which may be a bit of a challenge.I purchased it because I have to power spray my house especially under the eves, and anyone who has even done that knows that the water gets all over the place.I'll keep it anyway and hopefully I can make the alterations."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Light weight,5,"truly is light weight. shed the rain fine ,but it wasnt a real drencher of a downpour. seems like it will work just fine. breathes nicely. Bought an extra large and was surprised by American sizing not your typical undersized Asian sizes .This will work out well for me as I intend to wear it over a hoodie and/or a jacket  when I fly-fish. Cammo pattern was black and white ,but should be fine."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Fantastic for here to there no matter the occasion,5,Very impressive. Read all prior comments about the fitting. I measured myself to chart. Fits as chart measurement scales.  The Blue is more of a Royal Blue (dark blue with a shade of purple). Ptefect early spring and fall coat. Very classy with shirt and tie. Love it!
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Not meant for backpacking. Not for warmer weather,3,This is a great jacket for normal purposes. This is not a good rain jacket for hiking or backpacking.  It’s too warm in warmer weather and not that light so you can just use it as the outer most layer of your clothes. Great for using around town not good for backpacking.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Surprised by the quality 😁,5,"I was truly surprised by the quality and craftsmanship of this product. Before purchasing it I was looking at other raincoats from North face, colombia, LL Bean.For one third less the price of the other raincoats this is a superb buy. I recommend it 👍"
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Quality,5,"This is a very nice quality jacket for the price. It fit very well. No too big and not too tight. I am 5'10"" 205 lbs. athletic build. It has not been out in the rain yet. I wore it in 30 degree windy conditions and it was warm with a fleece vest under it."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Exactly what I was looking for,5,Honestly I just bought it so I had some type of rain jacket but this specific one for photography for the person in the photo. It is very vibrant. And it really holds up as far as keeping you dry! Very comfy and feels like it will last if you take care of it. Not suited for winter. It keeps the rain out not the cold. (Light jacket)
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,After 10 mins in rain,2,"Bought this to go stomping in puddles with my tiny human. Picture is my shirt underneath after about 5-10 minutes outside, my hair was soaked. It wasn't that hard of rain and I have only used it one other time. I guess it's better than nothing?"
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Love this raincoat. Perfect with a hoodie,5,Got a skinny guy here who actually found a raincoat worthy of his stuff-always-too-damn-short-for-my-long-arms problem. He is 5’11” weighs 145 and has a reach that’s unmatched for me but hey at least I can fit into coats at the store. He puts his arms out and the cuffs always fall to his forearms. Not this coat.

OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Not waterproof at all. DO NOT BUY. JUNK..,1,Looks good and that's where it stops. 2nd time wearing the jacket and I got soaked and both times the rain wasn't heavy. It was a light lingering rain.. Look elsewhere for a true waterproof jacket. Do not buy.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Very light weight waterproof rain jacket,5,"I ordered one in extra large. That’s the size I use for all my sweatshirts and jackets. It was a little loose, but good if it was cold and needed to wear a thicker sweater under. The large is perfect, wearing a tee shirt, but not much else.  Very waterproof, water just beads off. The extra large would have been fine in all applications, but I like this jacket so much I didn’t mind buying two of them."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Sizing!,5,Finally found a size that fits! I'm 6'3 with a 46 chest and first purchased the xl which was waaay to bug so I went with med next and it was on the snug size.. last but not least I got the LG and it's a perfect fit.

OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Can't beat the value,5,"This rain jacket is just as good as those brand name jackets from those ""outdoor/named after a nature location"" stores, but at a fraction of the price. Definitely worth the price. Waterproof as advertised."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great Rain Jacket,4,This lightweight rain jacket does the job. It does a great job shedding the rain. And it is roomy enough to wear a sweatshirt underneath for warmth. The pockets are large and well placed so you are not reaching backwards to get your hands in and the all-important inside pocket lends some security. All-in-all a great addition to your foul weather wardrobe.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,I love this Jacket!,5,My first impression is that this jacket is great!  It fits me well and seems really well made.  Has great features like Velcro wrists.  I like the white camopattern.  Will update if any issues but this seems like a great deal!

OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Perfect for Alaska,5,Perfect for Alaska summers. I live in Alaska and is great for hiking or everyday wear. Fits very good. For the price and fit couldn’t recommended enough.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Worst,5,"This jacket is great for the price point. It doesn't stand up to a driving downpour, but it will keep you dry in a pop up shower. It is unbeatable in the wind. It blocks the wind and the hood has an elastic band with adjustable drawstring loops so it doesn't just fall off when you put it up. I bought it specifically for working (I am a landscaper) and it has been well worth it. The only real downside is that it doesn't breathe, so while you aren't getting rained on, you are sweating if it is a warm day."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Rain jacket,5,I moved to Texas i knew i was going to need a rain jacket i purchased it.

OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Extraordinary !!,5,This jacket is amazing I plan on buying for others. We went up one size so a sweatshirt could be worn under in colder weather. As this is a spring/fall jacket. It’s waterproof and it gets wet but stays completely dry. Bought for college student who walks to class.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Cool looking, good jacket for the price.",4,I love the red color and overall look of the jacket.Wore it in the rain last week and it worked as hoped for. It was a bit bigger than I thought it would be so I'd suggest people be careful when ordering their normal size. I don't mind it so much: I just roll up the sleeves a bit.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Excellent Product,5,"My son is 12 yrs. Old, 5'3, 105 lbs. Average build, height and weight. I'm glad I read the reviews and ordered him a medium. It's a tiny to big. But, he has has room to grow into it. Love it. Nice color, size, well made. Will purchase on for myself."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Good Quality, Well Designed",5,Good quality. Would order again. The size runs big. I ordered a large but could have probably been better with a medium. That said I like this rain coat. It zips and there are Velcro closures at points to really keep the rain out. I was in a storm and stayed very dry.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Light weight,4,Very light weight: like the option I can remove the hood. The sleeves are a little long for bee but other than that I wanted a light weight jacket now I have a good one.

OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,0utstanding value !!!,5,"This is my  2nd review  and 4th jacket. 2 Black in 2xl,1 Navy Blue and 1 Grey in large. The blue is navy blue not purplish color. Overall the jackets fit a little big especially the sleeves but they it compensates by being very comfortable, warm and waterproof 💧. I tested it out in the recent rain 🌧 in NY and it wicked away the moisture. Outstanding !!!!"

OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Good and comfortable,5,"It is good. Medium rain and I did not got wet. I will say that it runs a little large. My advice is mesure yourself first. I order an XL and is little  loose but nothing crazy. I am 238 ,5’11. I think the material is good. Saw something similar in target for around 55 dollars so I’m glad I bought this one. Adiós"
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Too flimsy,3,It is not as waterproof as I would have hoped. Seems more water repellent than waterproof. Also was hoping it would be heavier. Also interior lining was not described and it is mesh netting that gets snagged on clothes.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Pretty good,4,"You get what you pay for. This jacket doesn't cost as much as a designer equivalent. The hood drawstrings on mine broke after a couple of uses to the point I had to replace them with a shoestring. Not having some kind of tightener on the hood makes it pretty useless in windy environments. Aside from that, great product."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Appears to be good quality material and the size was good.,5,So far from just putting the jacket on and trying it I like it as it fits well and it looks like it’s made of good quality material.

OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Water Resistant, size up if not slim",4,My son is slim snd 5’”4 so it looked good on him. What we didn’t like was that he had to wear a hoodie underneath definitely not insulated. Wind was blowing heavily here in Denver and there was wet snow coming down. He did stay dry.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Repels water,5,I use this to accomplish outdoor chores when it's raining.  I don't get wet.  A little hot in the heat but I'd rather be hot than wet.  I just shake it before going indoors and it sheds the water and is pretty much dry.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Amazing value.,4,"Very good rain jacket. Light enough to not notice it but heavy enough to block some wind too.  Overall a good purchase and an exceptional value for the price.  Only downside is it's not the most breathable, but it's very difficult to find a good rain jacket that is."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,FITS A SIZE 44JJ BUST,5,"My daughter searched high and low for comfortable, long sleeve raincoat that would accommodate the fact that she has a uncommonly large bust.She is a 44JJ size bust and this coat worked for her.  I was surprised since it was a men's jacket but it worked fantastic for her.Good quality, fairly lightweight.Not heavy duty and I would not call this cheap. We are very happy with our purchase.Waist will fit hips up to about a ""size 24"" in women's."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Good,5,"Real waterproof lightweight shell, looks more expensive than it is. Long arms for once!!

OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Heroes in a half shell.,4,"This jacket seems to be quality material and fixed nicely.

OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Keeps me dry 😀,5,I needed a light weight rain jacket for work.

OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Completely Soaked,1,"Had high hopes for this jacket. First time wearing it, for 2 hours in a steady drizzle, I came away with a completely soaked shirt. The jacket was zipped up all the way, velcro sealed, and chin strap attached to keep the hood up. Water came straight through the jacket. I tried including a photo of the shirt I was wearing under the jacket but Amazon rejected it because it wasn't of the product in question....so you'll have to use your imagination. If you're really looking for good protection in wet conditions, look elsewhere."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Excellent quality,5,"The first try was too small, but the quality was good enough that I returned the first for a second that was larger. I'm very happy with that one. Nice design; excellent workmanship."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Good Buy,4,Really like this jacket. Just maybe sized a tad small especially for me buying a men's 2XL. Other than that great material...lightweight and made well. Like the extra inside pocket.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Good visible color and fit but too sweaty,3,"I got this to walk in my neighborhood and wanted something to keep me dry and be very visible, and it is. Also the detachable hood is plus. However this jacket will get you sweaty rather quickly in the body. The sleeves are lined differently and are even quicker to get you sweating."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Who knows for whom the bell rolls?,5,This looks and feels like a quality raincoat. I haven’t given it to my skinny-as-hell brother yet. But it looks like the small will fit. The removable hood is a nice extra.
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Not waterproof...,2,"It's a nice jacket, but one big flaw... The zipper on the hood catches water. Soaked my back when it was raining pretty hard (use it for my job outside). I sewed the hood to the jacket so hopefully that helps, otherwise I need something else."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great rain coat for great price.,5,Great price for a great rain jacket.  Very water proof and big enough to wear over a coat. Runs a little big if you plan on wearing just the rain jacket. Not very thick so don’t expect a lot of warmth but will keep you dry for sure!
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great Product!,4,"My raincoat came just as pictured, i bought a size Medium & it fits just right, but the cuffs for the sleeve have this velcro strapping to enclose the wrist area, but it looks & feels soo atrange to me.Living in the caribbean & currently in the hurricane season which is why i bought this jacket, i have yet to test it out in any rainy weather for now, so i cant speak on how it holds under heavy to moderate rainy weather"

OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,well made,4,"When I read the description, I assumed it was warm.  I was wrong.  It does protect against rain and wind, but there is no padded lining.  Good quality product."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Simply not waterproof,1,"It is dishonest for the seller to call this waterproof.  It is not.  The day after it arrived, I took my dog for a 90 minute walk in a light, ongoing rain.  I was soaked at the end.  Both shoulders got wet to the skin through the jacket, then a fleece and shirt.  It is simply not waterproof and it's wrong to say it is.  At best, it would keep you dry on a foggy day or maybe in a light mist for a short period of time."
OTU Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Light weight and well-made,5,Light weight and well-made. The jacket fits well and it’s sturdy enough but also lightweight. Perfect when you’re going hiking it doesn’t have talk to your bag.

Columbia Men's PFG Storm Jacket,"Great Shell Jacket, but runs long.",5,"Great shell rain jacket. Perfect for spring time and layering in the fall/winter as well.The only downside to this jacket for me is that it fits rather large, even for a shell. It is a PFG item, and intended for fishing so this is probably how most would prefer it, but I prefer a more tight fit for casual wear. I'm 6'2"" and weigh 225 and typically wear an XL size for jackets, but I had to buy a Large for a proper fit.Overall, great price and great product. Would highly recommend to anyone."

Columbia Men's PFG Storm Jacket,,0,"Though I have not worn it out in the rain yet it appears to be a very well made, comfy, light jacket. As it's Columbia I have no doubt it will be very waterproof as per the other reviews.. Fit is about right, maybe a little small for the size but I'm built like a level, bubbles in the middle!"
Columbia Men's PFG Storm Jacket,,0,"Ordered this for use on a trek, looks good, fits good. This is as per US sizing so please order by looking at standard US size chart.

Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,"Wonderful Jacket, Very Warm and Comfortable. Looks Fantastic",5,"This jacket is wonderful. It is surprisingly very warm and completely waterproof in my experience. I have taken it on many rainy hikes and came out completely dry (at least on my top half...). I will probably be using it from now on to go skiing on any day above 25-30 degrees, its that warm and water/wind resistant. It looks super stylish with its athletic fit and fits me perfectly (M, 5'10"" 175). Probably the best clothing purchase I have made online. Would 100% recommend it."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,"The fit is good, not great.",3,"I ordered this jacket as a mid-weight option for Fall and Spring.  (I live in southern New England)  I ordered a Men's size medium since I am 5'7"" and 160#. The length of the jacket is right on, however, the sleeves are tight at the upper arm area when wearing just a short sleeve t-shirt underneath. (My upper arm diameter measures 13"") Also, the zipper pull is located on the left side of the jacket, which is definitely not what I'm used to. Otherwise, the Helly Hansen quality appears to be there."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,"Great fit, great price",4,"I snagged this on a sale Amazon had just in time for my sailing trip.  I love the color, and the fit.  I own several Arc'teryx and North Face gear and this was my first HH jacket.  It's a little loud for logos (5 of them throughout the outside of the jacket), but the color was just what I wanted, and it fits great!  The DWR coating (waterproofing) isn't out of the box ready like my Arc'teryx/TNF gear, but after a wash with the Nikwax made splashes while sailing not an issue.  I would buy again."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,Check fit twice.,5,Love this jacket.  The attention to detail is amazing.  Iwear a 3xl shirt but am happy with the fit of the 4xl.  Very roomy.  A Quality product.  Liked it so much I purchased a white one
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,Fits and fells great,5,"We had a random snowstorm in early August (gotta love Colorado weather), and I was excited to try out my new jacket. It fits great and is extremely warm. I went for a walk around the city and captured a few pictures of the snowfall and stayed toasty warm the entire time. I highly recommend the jacket; it's worth every penny."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,Very Stylish,5,"Glad I was able to order this through Amazon. Helly Hansen didn’t have the color available on their website. So many compliments with how good these jackets look. Coming from North Face Jackets, I’m very pleased with the quality and look. This jacket does tend to run a size smaller. Jacket is so lightweight and warm at the same time. Ordered it in black as well!"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,Pleased,5,"After a few wears I’m upping my review this jacket feels good and looks good on me. The large is kinda small large me being of average height and size, I cannot gain too many pounds."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,JUST AS I EXPECTED :),5,"Love it. Just love it. I'm 6ft 0.5in at 150-160pds and I bought a medium. Fits perfectly, maybe a little longer down the body but has drawstrings at the bottom. I'd say a little puffier than desired for my liking since I'm so slim. A small would have probably done good, but of course for $185, you want to keep it forever. Super thin, yet somehow incredibly warm. Helly Hansen is definitely a brand that stands out, not just by designs and performance reputation, but not seen on too many people in the states."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,Order a size up.,4,"Order a size up. At 5’6” athletic build, an XL was too tight on me. Sleeve length, waist, all seemed good."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,1 Size Small,5,Great looking jacket.  Haven't warn it outside yet but it is definitely smaller than most.  I saw many of the reviews and decided to go 3XL when I usually wear a 2XL.  That was a good choice as it fits pretty well.

Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,Very nice and comfortable,5,"This is my 2nd Helly Hansen Jacket, got this one in XXXL...they tend to run a bit snug under the arm area.  I think getting a size bigger is perfect.  Nice looking jacket should be great for upcoming winter weather."

Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,Great looking jacket,5,"This is a really great looking jacket, with a very well cut arm that provides great movement with out needing to be a size bigger. The med is a snug fit on my 6'3 190 build with long arms. Looks fantastic and feels warm and waterproof."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,I pretty much like every aspect of this jacket,5,"I pretty much like every aspect of this jacket! It fits my (pretty average) body in a perfect way. I'm 5'11 / 185 lbs and ordered large. It has a bit of insulation so it's a perfect jacket for autumn/spring time. It looks good, it feels good and oozes quality. I basically loved the jacket from the moment I first tried it on."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,It’s worth the money.,5,I like it fur to the fact that it’s very lightweight and it keeps you warm
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,Amazing jacket,5,Excellent quality and fit very well
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Originally intended as a second, back-up to a Mummut or North Face jacket, to be worn in Spring and/or Summer, the Midlayer is surprisingly warm, fleece-lined throughout. Residing in Highland Scotland, spring and summer are often equivalent to winter further south (frequently single figure temperatures) - more alike to Scandinavian weather than that enjoyed, for example, by Continental Europe. At time of writing around 1 degree centigrade, an individual can quite comfortably walk around with the Midlayer without feeling cold.An XL in this instance, reviewer is often between sizes 'large' and 'extra large' depending on brand (Large for North Face jackets) due to being broad across the shoulders, relatively long torso, 40"" chest and average length legs (32-33"" inside seam). The Midlayer comes down to just below reviewer's hip-bone and is a decent fit, though the waist adjustment had to be pulled in slightly. The pockets are not huge - a Samsung S20FE pretty much fills 'main' waist pockets - and reviewer is not enamoured by the red zip tassels (navy would look better) though these are a triviality and can easily be removed.The large 'HH' in white is overused but does not detract too much from appearance and a needless design below the packable hood can be covered by this feature - the Midlayer looks better with hood out/down. Midlayer does not look overly 'Dadsy' due to its length and does not bear the outright appearance of a rain-coat despite being Helly-Tech waterproof. Reviewer customarily (minus pandemic) wears dress trousers and shoes to work and the Midlayer is passable both with these and jeans. Having previously purchased a Berghaus 'Storm Cloud' water-proof jacket (the feeling on the skin from this particular jacket is horrendous), the Midlayer is much more comfortable with its smooth fleece lining.Somewhat reluctant to invest in a brand hi-jacked by parent-sponsored chavs and neds, Helly Hansen nevertheless consistently features high on outdoor jacket ratings. For a relatively low price, the Midlayer is a sound investment, high quality product boasting surprising spec."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Such a good jacket I bought another.Warm and waterproof, a must have for the best of British weather. Only lacks a hood, but they do make the exact same jacket with a built in hood, and yes I also have bought one of those.I used to be a massive fan of Berghaus Goretex jackets, and yes they are still one of the best. But Helly Hansen is just as good and cheaper, especially at Amazon.The fit is comfortable and all the zips are easy to use, I know the zip thing sounds stupid, but some very expensive jackets I have bought in the past have been a real hassle to zip up.Only criticism is that the pockets are a touch small, must be a sailing thing as I normally buy hiking jackets."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"I love this jacket. I have the Navy one and it just looks so smart. I am a big fan of helly hansen sailing clothes. The jacket is warm and the fit is perfect , if only slightly too small over the shoulders , only because I am a bit broad there tho. The pockets have zips which have red contrast and the velcro wrist adjustment is easy to use.It has plenty of H/H  logos on the sleeves and Helly Hansen written in full on the back of the collar. The hood is a good size and fit and has easy drawstring adjustment. Nice microfleece lining which is not too bulky. As I said before its a great jacket which I love to wear."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Took me a while to find a jacket like my old HH from years ago which was waterproof, light and had a hood. This is maybe on the warm side for me due to the polartech fleece lining which you can't remove. Fully waterproof so far, zips are all fine and you can tighten the hood properly. The branding is a little obnoxious, I thought one of the logos on the arm was a sticker but it's not lol. The prices on here vary loads all the time so make sure you buy it when its at a decent price.I'm 6.5/6.6ft and its just long enough for me, I didn't want a long coat so this covering the belt and top of my trousers is perfect length for me, arms are quite long but then so are mine."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"I've had a Musto coastal jacket for 10 yrs  and warn it everyday in winter - and now its finally time to let it go and move on. So I thought I'd try Helly Hansen.  Wow. In fact 2 wow factors:1) Can't believe how warm and light it is2) Can't believe how light and warm it isWhen you put this coat on you'll think one of these 2 things.And the other stuff? Yes, really well made, Yes really comfortable, yes really good fit, yes nice features , yes really waterproof in the pouring rain but its the wow factors that will get you."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"I spent ages looking for a good quality jacket which would keep me dry and warm. I found it at last. Many others are just crap quality these days and while this is expensive I can assure you it's well worth the asking price. I was wary purchasing at the £96-ish quid I paid but I'm very happy with it.If like me you've struggled to find a good quality jacket that will keep you warm, dry and is lightweight with plenty of pockets this is the one.  When I inevitably need a new jacket one day Helly Hansen will be on the top of my list."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Thankyou for the jacket, The jacket is exactly as expected if Helly Hansen I've had three jackets of H/H and they have always been amazing quality. This jacket is a lot more lightweight than my previous dubliner Helly Hansen jacket i brought about a year ago, its polartech lining inside the jacket is amazing keeps you warm but stops you from sweating and over heating i haven't tested it in the rain yet which is typical as it was raining the day before it's arrival but i have very high expectations that H/H delivers its quality with the Hellytech to keep you dry and also the value for money is incredible as these specific jackets are very pricey in other stores unless they are getting rid of old stock but on the whole this is a must buy if your looking for a christmas gift or bday present or even for yourself i would highly recommend this jacket just make sure you know what size your buying as a lot of people don't take into consideration these jackets are one inch smaller in length than other jackets like my dubliner for example."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,The product feels warm and of good quality. I have not put it to the test yet but I am disappointed to find that the sleeves are polartec lined which means that anything you wear underneath sticks to the polartec and makes it difficult to put on. The sleeves should have been lined with a smooth material that does not cause friction with underlayer sleeves.
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"La marca Helly Hansen, te asegura un producto de calidad, siempre que sea original claro y LO ES! sin duda. Chaqueta de entre-tiempo que puedes usar perfectamente en inviernos suaves (Tª > 5-10º ), abriga bastante. Es totalmente impermeable y su forro interior fino pero muy cálido. Lo complicado es acertar con las tallas comprando online, y aunque yo seguí las instrucciones de la pagina oficial de HH, que me recomendaba una talla L, la tuve que devolver y pedir la M. Lo curioso es que las tallas deben de ser dobles y la diferencia entre una L/G y una M/M es importante. Teóricamente cambié L por M, pero en la etiqueta interior de las chaquetas fue L/G por M/M, en la práctica pasé de ""un saco patatas a un guante"" ;-)"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Fantastic jacket, felt a bit light weight when first on but is alot warmer than you think. Sizes are neat, I fit small I  Tshirts but needed Medium in this jacket. The white has Grey fleece as others have mentioned. All round very pleased. Have had people say it looks very smart."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Warm for its weight and extremely waterproof. The rain just beads up on the material and doesn’t soak in (I’ve only tested this for an hour whilst dog walking in heavy rain, not sure if it would last all day)Great design and a really nice combo of navy blue material with red zips.I would definitely recommend.I’m thinking of buying a second one for work as I work outdoors."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Top draw all fleece lined falls weight to .. not been in heavy rain yet so cant answer that.. bought 100 pound bauhaus and that let a little shower in.. so wont be buying there products no more.  Back to HH happy if not with rain designer 100% 👍bought the white one.  Buying black soon..
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"There's absolutely nothing bad I can say about this jacket. Stylish, top notch materials, fully rain and wind proof and extremely comfortable. What more is there to say? Expensive, yes but I'm investing in the longer term with this purchase."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"True to size, lightweight yet fully lined and warm. Hood is very practical for the occasional shower or to protect from spray. Dark blue color is very nice. Perfect as a mid-layer or on its own. Very good value for money."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Absolutely brilliant jacket. I wear as an out layer despite the name, and for inshore and coastal sailing it is fantastic. Kept me dry all weekend in poor weather on a rib and sailing. Not the most leightweight, but given its quality, it’s worth the money. Also very windproof and it is machine washable."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Very very comfortable, totally waterproof and nice and warm. I keep this in my car at all the time as I'm not a jacket person but this I wanted as a light wearable winter type of jacket, it keeps the wind and rain out and can wear layers underneath for added comfort.For me the perfect jacket going into winter and a Great all round everyday jacket."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Purchased for dog walking, with the need for something properly waterproof. It's doing the job brilliantly so far. It's a lot thinner than I was hoping for, but is actually pretty warm, so I won't return it. The sleeves are half fleeced, as is the back and neck. Nice to have a quality item."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,This is not a fitted jacket and comes very large. I would normally order a large but the fit of this could seems double that so I would definitely drop a size if ordering. The jacket is quite thin and good for mid weather or wearing a few layers underneath.
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Os voy a echar una mano, mido 1.68 cm y peso 47. Soy de complexión delgada y me costaba decidirme entre la S o la XS. Siempre elijo M pero me dijeron que esta marca talla más grande. En la página oficial de HH tienen un selector de tallas en el que pones el peso tu altura, tipo de cuerpo y demás y te saca un porcentaje de clientes con tu misma complexión y que tallas les ha ido bien, a mi me salió XS y me va perfecta. No me gusta que las chaquetas me queden demasiado holgadas. Pero tampoco muy apretadas.Puntos a favor:La capucha cubre bastanteDiseño bonitoImpermeableLas muñecas pueden ajustarseLa capucha se puede recogerVarios bolsillos, uno de ellos en interiorLigera, no pesa nada. No molesta ni agobia.Cubre cuellos para los dias de vientoPuntos en contra:Por decir algo, es fina. Yo vivo en Barcelona y ahora en primavera irá de lujo pero en invierno o días muy fríos recomiendo otro tipo de atuendo, o poneros más prendas debajo, yo en la foto llevaba una sudadera talla M.Añado que el precio de la xS es un poco más caro. Me ha costado 99 euros pero esta chaqueta en la tienda oficial vale 170€Osea que.. Espero que os sirva de ayuda."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Lovd the quality of jacket.Perfect whenever I go out in rain or wind.Design is very nice too.
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Good quality, good fit, good looking, it water proof as well, but don't think it'll keep you warm it won't so if your intention is to have a warm jacket to 'boot' buy a size up and put something warm underneath it."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Mido 1,84 y peso 84 kgs. la talla L es perfecta.Prenda muy cómoda, ligera y abrigada a pesar de tener un aparentemente sencillo forro polo pero que hace milagros pues a temperaturas frescas uno no siento el frio para nada.Ideal para climas lluviosos, húmedos y frescos con temperaturas entre 5 y 15 grados, aunque con temperaturas inferiores tampoco he notado frio.El único inconveniente que le podría poner es que la capucha no es extraíble y cuando se quiere recoger o plegar el cuello de la prenda aumenta y se nota un poco voluminoso."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Excellent jacket, windproof and waterproof. Had a real test through many storms this winter! Smart looking and snug fit."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Fantastic Jacket. I haven’t stopped wearing it since it arrived. Love it. It’s my new go-to jacket. It’s versatile, lightweight, warm, windproof, waterproof and fits like a glove (perfect)."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,I'm really happy with this jacket. The material is of an excellent quality and the jacket is lightweight but warm. It is also very water resistant. The design is really nice and fits well. I can't think of any negatives so far.
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Quality jacket and is very waterproof after being out in torrential rain fir an hour and a half still kept me dry highly recommended
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"The jacket is great, very comfortable, fits very well and it’s warm enough. Wouldn’t recommend for winter, unless with wearing a jumper underneath."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Used it as my outer layer on a week long snow-holing/climbing/dog-sledging trip to Norway in February.  Absolutely fantastic bit of kit - windproof, waterproof, very comfy and looked good too.  Got it on offer at £35 - great deal."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,I specifically ordered a hooded one and arrived without. I lost many time during buying and returning and I was expecting a faster response because I was not have alternative to wear then I had to order another different type.
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Mint best jacket I've boughtPricey tho
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Thanks very much. Way better than 3 in 1 North Face. Quality is as it should be! Comes very very close to Mammuth.
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Great winter spring autumn jack. Feels very warm and great for occasional downpours. Size is just about right for me but may be a bit snug for others. Make sure you check the size chart before you buy.
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Amazing jacket, very warm but light weight bought a Large originally for ,my other half but had to get an XL and he isn’t that big, so get one size bigger than you think"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Great Jacket - very light weight being good for rain but insulating being able to wear in the cold. Very unique design and branding makes it stand out.

Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,The inner lining comes out by the sleeves.This item did not passed quality control.It’s a shame on HH

Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Great product and really well described!  Love the Jacket
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"I get hot when I wear jackets and coats with down in them. They look nice, but they are making me sweat AND they're bulky, so I can feel encumbered. Everytime I googled ""Waterproof Windproof Jacket"" this brand came up - Helly Hansen. I've never just ordered a jacket without first trying it on, but I could not find this particular style anywhere near me so I just took a chance out of desperation...This is a really nice jacket if you want a thin or light profile jacket shell intending to wear something beneath like a t-shirt, then a light hoodie or maybe a thermal hoodie - then this jacket. If you wear the jacket in temperatures like -30°(-22°F) to 10° (50°F) you WILL be cold, but you wont feel the wind, which in my opinion is the when people feel the most cold during any season - so if you can't feel the wind, that should mean you'll be more comfortable in colder climates.Do not expect this jacket to do all of the work when it comes to regulating your body heat. I have gone to do a grocery run in this jacket with just a t-shirt in -5° (23°F) tempuratures. It wasn't the smartest idea, but it still worked better than I expected. Bottom line is, as long as your ""base layer"" is keeping you a little too warm in room tempuratures, then your good for a Canadian winter."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Obviously quality is good, it's a Helly Hansen. These generally fit small, I normally wear medium in jackets and wear a large in helly, I may have gotten a medium and been ok but I figure it would be tight in my shoulders. Plus it's ok to have a slightly loose fit."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Great quality.
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Great jacket, lightweight but warm fleece lining and fitted perfectly."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"I bought it to play bowls outdoors in the rain, hopefully it will be waterproof."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Very Nice Jacket
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Excellent jacket exactly as described
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,This is an excellent jacket however the one i received isnt the hooded model as described in the advert. Buyer be aware!
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Brilliant. Really light weight and warm
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Brilliant jacket for try e cooling weather
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Fantastic jacket perfect for activities!!!
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"En mi caso la L me quedaba un poco justa y la XL un poco grande. Al final opté por la XL por comodidad.Es una chaqueta especialmente fina y ligera. Muy chula, si calentara mas sería perfecta.Se puede utilizar como capa intermedía, es decir, en lugar de jersey encima otra capa de mas abrigo, o directamente como última capa.La recomiendo para temperaturas hasta a 10º. Para mi gusto es demasiado fina y no abriga lo suficiente si la temperatura es inferior. Salvo que te pongas debajo algo que abrigue mucho.La parte interior es como un forro polar, muy agradable al tacto y transpira perfectamente, no se acumula nada de humedad en el interior.La capucha se puede dejar fuera o guardada en el cuello, pero no se puede quitar. Personalmente la dejo fuera porque me da la sensación de que hace el cuello demasiado ancho.Es totalmente impermeable."

Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Light and warm.
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Ho acquistato una XXL in sconto a circa 90 euro. Un prezzo favoloso rispetto al prezzo ordinario ed alla qualità dell'oggetto. La giacca è ottima fino a temperature di circa 8-10 gradi.L'ho provata con lo scooter in città e protegge molto bene contro il vento.Giacca molto leggera ed il pile interno tiene caldo anche se fa un po' di attrito con i maglioncini.Le taglie sono del tipo ""Comfort Fit"" e quindi occhio se siete molto magri che magari dovete pendere una taglia in meno oppure la volete mettere sopra una giacca.Devo ancora testare l'impermeabilità ma come leggo dovrebbe avere una tenuta di 100 minuti sotto una pioggia media.Esteticamente molto bella con un blu navy accattivante, una piccola striscia fosforescente sul retro, insieme alla possibilità di inserire una targhetta dentro ad un taschino trasparente."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Avevo bisogno di un giacchetto impermeabile comodo per lavoro e tempo libero senza spendere un'eresia e dopo molti dubbi, ho deciso di ""fidarmi"" sia di questa marca che conoscevo per fama ma non per aver mai avuto un capo da indossare, sia delle recensioni degli altri utenti. Sono molto soddisfatto dell'acquisto, ho avuto modo di provarlo in una giornata con molto vento e sotto una pioggia piuttosto intensa e devo dire che ha tenuto in maniera ottimale la temperatura corporea, non solo all'aperto ma anche quando sono entrato in un edificio più caldo; pensavo di fare una sudata e invece ha favorito la termoregolazione. Eccellente la tenuta alla pioggia, non si è inzuppato e non è passato niente. E' bastato scuoterlo e l'acqua è scivolata via. Veramente un ottimo prodotto"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Non conoscevo affatto la marca Helly-Hansen e mi sono imbattuto in questa fantastica Jacket per puro caso sfogliando le sezioni (ben curate) di Amazon.Dopo 2 settimane di utlizzo in situazioni di: vento, pioggia, temperature oscillanti dai 4 gradi ad un massimo di 14, devo dire che sono estremamente impressionato sia dalla qualità costruttiva, dal design, dai particolari curati, dalla comodità, dalla traspirabilità, ma soprattutto dalla tenuta sotto acqua (clamorosa) e dalla capacità del capo di mantenere il calore corporeo!Vedrò nelle prossime settimane come terrà con temperature in discesa sotto lo zero, ma se tanto mi dà tanto, non farà una piega; anche perchè a 5 gradi centigradi, con una lunga camminata di 30 minuti, avevo persino caldo indossando sotto una semplicissima camicia di cotone... Pazzesco.Mi è piaciuta così tanto la qualità e cura di questa marca, che ho fatto una scelta mirata: acquistare anche una Jacket primaverile per pioggia, un paio di scarpe invernali waterproof e tra poco anche un beretto invernale.Per me, la Helly-Hansen è una marca di qualità da tenere d'occhio per chi ama sia il fashion, che l'abbigliamento tecnico."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Perfecta para dias de lluvia y viento,totalmente impermeable y transpirable, no deja pasar nada de viento y abriga bien llevando una segunda capa por el forro de polartec que lleva incluido, es muy comoda, no es nada rigida como otras, tiene velcros en los puños para adaptar a gusto de cada uno y tambien tiene unos tensores en el bajo y en el gorro para ajustar mas al cuerpocomo bolsillos tiene los dos tipocos a los laterales y uno en el pecho eso en el exterior e interiormente tiene otro bolsillo en un lateral un poco mas bajo.Muy contento con la compra y totalmente recomendable"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,I'm very happy!
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,The jacket is terrific. Perfect for fall or spring. we live in a northern climate so not really warm enough for January and February. The cut is very modern. No sag or loose end and it fresh enough to dress up or dress down. Doesn’t look out of place with dress pants or with jeans so I love the versatility. The tuck away hood is nice too and not too bulgy in the back of neck. Great quality overall and runs normal size. Not too skinny or too baggy. It’s is good at blocking out wind and rain without being too heavy and has some insulation for colder days but again for me not a winter jacket.  Highly recommend it.
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Si buscas una chaqueta impermeable que abrigue muy poco esta bien. Yo por ejemplo vivo en el levante y no me viene bien para los dias frios por eso la he devuelto, sabia que si me la quedaba acabaria usandola poco o nada.Por lo que cuesta es mejor comprarse otra chaqueta con algo mas de relleno de Columbia o The North Face por ejemplo que tambien son impermeables"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Me encanta el diseño y el tacto del forro del interior de la chaqueta. Por otro lado la encuentro demasiado fina y no creo que abrigue lo suficientemente en temperaturas entre 0-10 grados.Respecto a la talla me he cogido una L, la prove en la tienda el mismo día pero cuando me ha llegado de Amazon me va larga de brazos y me hace un poco *saco de patata * pero es mi talla ya que gracia a los elásticos se puede cerciorar al cuerpo y así me abriga cubriendo tanto en la cintura como en los brazos sin que me salga de las mangas."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Not much to say other than it is awesome. You get what you pay for. Love the blue color, fit is excellent & despite the thin profile it keeps me very warm. Lots of pockets. Immaculate jacket, which is what I expected buying a Helly Hansen. I bought it for the color & get compliments all the time. Also, you can adjust the sleeves with velcro easily if you're wearing gloves."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Super Jacke mit verschweißten Nähten, schöner Optik und hochwertigen Materialien.Hält auch bei enormem Windchill warm!Für mein Empfinden eignet sich die Jacke nicht zum Skifahren, Radfahren oder ähnliche andere Freizeitbeschäftigungen weil man dort a) zu schnell schwitzt und sie b) dafür zu kurz ist.Aber das macht auch weiter nichts, da man beim Segeln ja i.d.R. auch eine entspr. Hose mit hohem Latz trägt."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Non mi soffermo nel parlare della qualità del prodotto, vi vorrei solo aiutare nella scelta della taglia. Io sono alto 1,80 cm e il mio peso è di 86 kg. La taglia XL calza a pennello. La potete usare si come giacca che come maglia mettendo una certa sopra."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Giacca fantastica, ricevuta da poco ma già testata all’aperto,Ottima tenuta al vento, la userò in barca come dal resto è stata progettata, la trovo anche abbastanza calda, io sono freddoloso ma sui 12/15 gradi tiene con una buona felpa sotto...Qualità costruttiva ottima.. giunture, zip e materiale! Io ho preso una M sono alto 185, abbastanza longilineo, mi sta giusta, di altre giacche porto la L."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Es la primera vez que he comprado una chaqueta de Helly Hansen y la verdad que estoy contento con la compra que he hecho.Abriga mucho, pesa muy poco y tiene un diseño muy deportivo, sobre todo la que he comprado en color azul claro (Olympian Blue) , la azul oscuro (Navy) es más elegante para vestir. Tiene velcro en los puños para ajustarlo y que no entre en frío. La capucha es solo para los días de lluvia porque abrigar no abriga, es como de plástico, quiero entender que es totalmente impermeable, esta se recoge en la parte superior enrollada y fijada con velcro en el cuello de la chaqueta. Recomiendo esta chaquetaAún no la he probado con día de lluvia, cuando lo haga editaré la opinión"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Good quality but for a reason we don't understand this jacket is verrrry shirt instead of another jacket my husband have of HH like 2inches shorter. As we know the helly Hansen is anyways smaller  than other company so we take a bigger size but it's short pretty short...  we will probably  retourn it.
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Enamorado de mi chaqueta. Es mucho más bonita y elegante una vez puesta y queda genial, tal y como suelen ser las prendas de esta marca que tengo. Lleva un poco de forro polar por dentro y abriga más de lo que aparenta. Muy recomendada."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Buena calidad, pero talla pequeño. Mido 1.82 y peso 82kg, y la L me vale justa para llevar solo con camiseta. Tiene un forro interior, pero muy fino. Abriga por tanto más que un Gore simple, o chubasquero sin forro, pero no es uuna prenda de abrigo de invierno al uso. Por 80€ tienes una prenda de marca, bien hecha, y bonita. Al precio original me parecería un precio desorbitado, habiendo marcas con muchísima más calidad/precio (pero sin HH). Pero le pongo 5 estrellas a 80€, pues es bonita y está bien hecha."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Initially i thought i should buy one size bigger, based on other review comments. I ordered a Large size (my usual size is medium). Unfortunately ""Large"" was too big - the sleeves were too long,  the body was too wide. So i switched to Medium size. ""Medium"" fitted me well and i was Satisfied.One thing worth to mention is that the web site picture was different from the actual product. The color of fleece was Grey in actual product but the picture of the website was shown Black. For me,  i didnt mind and I still liked this jacket."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,i love it its good and comfort and width stand cold weather i am truck driver i was looking a jacket which is not bulky and very thick finally i found what i was looking for worth the money and i am very impressed
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Vêtement bien fini, et bien pensé.Efficace contre al pluie, qui glisse totalement sur le tissus.Je porte un XL qui me va très bien (1m85 / 90 Kg).Poches faciles d'accès, à zip, bien positionnées. Il y a aussi une poche intérieure à zip, pratique.Revêtement intérieur douillet, avec une couche de polaire assez fin et très douce au toucher.Du coup, vêtement assez chaud, que je porte facilement entre 8 et 20°C, avec juste une chemise en dessous ou un même un tee shirt.C'est plutôt un blouson qu'une parka, ne couvre pas vraiment les fesses.J'adore la partie haute de ce vêtement, qui couvre bien le cou et vous garde bien au chaud.Il y a aussi une capuche que l'on peut sortir du col, en cas de pluie.Globalement, super achat."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Me daba un poco reparo gastarme ese dinero en una prenda así, pero después de usarla veo que es un dinero muy bien invertido. La uso cada día para ir al trabajo en bici o andando y los días de lluvia no me mojo nada, es un buen impermeable que además, por su forro, da una gran calidez.  Una muy buena prenda de artesanía que recomiendo 100%"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Mi è piaciuto l’articolo e soprattutto avendolo preso grande ho fatto il tesoro mi è stato sostituito dal venditore con estrema facilità e professionalità.

Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Ich habe die Jacke in Graphit blau bestellt, dargestellt mit roten Applikationen. Die gelieferte Jacke, Graphit blau, hat weissen Druck und Applikationen in Graphit blau, was sie langweilig aussehen lässt. Achtung, die Jacke ist sehr kurz."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Compre la color negro mate, super práctica, muy cálida desde el primer momento, con su gorro, bolsas y cierres bien, el cuello se ve muy elegante los puños ajustan con velcro, es justamente lo que necesito para mis actividades de campismo, senderismo o alta montaña. Mido 175 cms peso 85 kilos pedí la talla grande (Regular/Normale) me quedo bien como para ponerme algo mas por debajo en caso necesario. Me gustó mucho."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Non occorre descrivere più di tanto un prodotto Helly Hansen. Giubbotto meraviglioso, adatto a chi pratica vela, ma anche da indossare tutti i giorni invernali. Impermeabile con interno in pile. Prodotto magnifico. Lo consiglio vivamente."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Hoy los probé bajo la lluvia Y terminas mojando  Me quedado un poco decepcionado con este producto parece que ni fuera original tiene muchas fallas te entra el agua en los bolsillos el teléfono lo llevaba en el pecho y menos mal que es contra la humedad por  Si no hubiera roto el móvil muy decepcionado con esta prenda
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Absolute Top-Jacke!Federleicht, passt perfekt, hervorragend verarbeitet, absolut Wasser- und Winddicht, für die Übergangszeit perfekt durch das leichte Fleece...Für relativ kleines Geld absolute Spitzenqualität!Ich habe vorher verschiedene Jacken in der Preisklasse um 90 € probiert. Erheblicher chemischer Geruch, schlechte Passform, eine gute Softshelljacke, die Wind- und Wasserdicht ist, ist für diesen Preis nicht zu bekommen!Die HH war die perfekte Lösung zu einem wirklich hervorragenden Preis- Leistungsverhältniss!!!"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Mido 1,90 y peso 115 kg. La XXL me queda perfecta. Gran jaqueta para un invierno suave como en Huelva. Hasta 8 grados en el peor de los casos en un invierno que sea muy frío para Huelva. Perfecta 👌👌👌 muy buena calidad y polartec de calidad debe ser de 400 gr o así."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Buena calidad e impermeabilidad. Está muy bien terminada. Pero talla muy justa. Yo uso la L en todo y la chaqueta me quedaba muy justa. Imposible ponerla con jersey debajo. Aparte mido 1.91 y quedaba corta. 10 de calidad, pero por el tallaje se queda en 4 estrellas. Tuve que cambiarla."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Para 1,83 y 78 kilos de peso el tamaña adecuado es el L. Si no va muy ancho y las mangas son demasiado largas.La prenda, cálida, ligera y confortable. Muy contento con ella. Por ponerlae una pega, demasiada auto publicidad de la masrca, podían ser mas discretos."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Muy contento con la chaqueta, totalmete estanca al agua y viento y el forro polar interior que quita bastante frio. No es una chaqueta para climas frios, pero para climas algo mas cálidos va perfecta y si encima vivis en una zona de viento como yo entonces es perfecta, yo incluso la utilizo para ir en moto y no noto el aire para nada."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"La verdad que estoy encantado con las dos cazadoras una roja y la otra azul marino, no pesa nada y abriga muchísimo, es súper cómoda, para que los futuros compradores tengan una idea con la talla, yo peso 68 kilos y mido 1,71 y mi talla es la M  y me queda perfecta, desde luego aconsejo la cazadora, desde luego después de probarlas no me parece caro para la calidad que tiene."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Have had the Jacket for about a month.  Excellent shoulder month jacket - was warm wearing it down to 0 C / 32 F .  Have worn it in rain - excellent performance.
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Fue un regalo y no pude hacer mejor elección. Está muy un bien terminado, la tela es de muy buena calidad, ligero e impermeable. La talla perfecta según la guía del fabricante. La relación calidad precio excepcional, lo vi en una gran superficie por más del doble de su precio de compra. Un acierto."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Come da titolo. Metto in evidenza solo che il prodotto è leggero, ha una fodera interna in pile, adatta (per uso cittadino) solo per le mezze stagioni e non per l'inverno. Quanto all'uso principale per cui il prodotto nasce (nautica), non so esprimermi. Aggiungo foto della vista di schiena, richiesta da una domanda di un interessato. In foto il cappuccio è rinfoderato nel collo (ma a me le giacche piacciono di più con il cappuccio)"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"impermeabile  e calda.Non è una giacca  invernale ma è ottima per quelle serate fine estate nel pozzetto in barca.Si può utilizzare fino a 13 ,14 gradi.Poi bisogna indossare una felpa sotto il giacchino.Fatto molto bene.Non mi sembra molto traspirante.E' l'unico difetto"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Prenda de muy buena calidad.  El único pero es que en el exterior de la parte de arriba de la espalda tiene como un bolsillo de plástico transparente cuya utilidad desconozco,  y produce condensación del calor corporal.Por lo demás es una prenda estupenda."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Esattamente quello che cercavo, pile interno, ottime finiture come sempre da HH. Una giacca da indossare in barca, sebbene non heavy duty, e anche nel tempo libero. Ottimo il sistema per calcolare la taglia, sempre indeciso tra small e medium, nel mio caso ha funzionato perfettamente. Amazon puntuale come sempre."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Very nice.  Looks good, feels good and pockets are in the right position.  I wasn't expecting this jacket could be worn in -5°C, but it keeps me warm (along with a thin sweat shirt).I like the color and style.I am 6' tall and about 180 lbs.  The Large (L) fits nicely.  Not too loose nor too tight, just right ."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Queda como un guante. Puedes conducir perfectamente con la chaqueta puesta. Repele el agua muy bien y da calor, siendo transpirable. La había comprado mucho más cara en un comercio y la vi en Amazon mucho más barata ( casi 80 eur menos) Cuando me llegó comparé ambas y eran exactamente iguales. Cómo siempre, Amazon un 10"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"habe lange gebraucht, um mich an die vielen HH schriftzüge zu gewöhnen allerdings reflektieren alle ""werbe"" schriftzüge daher sehr sicher und zu akzeptieren, und mit dem fakt das diese Jacke komplett  Wasserdicht ist meine absolute lieblingsjacke bei schlechtem wetter"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Insgesamt wirkt die Jacke hochwertig verarbeitet.Der ersten Erfahrungen nach hält sich ausreichend warm und ist in ausreichendem Maße wasserdicht.Die Passform ist grundsätzlich sehr gut. Allerdings ist zu beachten, dass Übergang Ärmel / Rumpf unterhalb der Achsel sehr eng geschnitten ist und einschneiden kann, wenn man sich bewegt."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Esta muy bien, no es muy liviana ni pesada. Abriga mucho. Aún no la probé en lluvia, pero por lo que parece servirá bien. Contento. Yo compré la L, soy ancho de espalda, me queda un poco larga de brazos pero de ancho perfecta. Las mangas tienen velcro, entonces sin problemas."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Love this jacket! Even though it's light the warmth it provides is amazing. Love the design, it has zip vents inside that allows ventilation, had plenty of pockets, very waterproof, and gives you room to layer up as well."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Overall excellent quality jacket. Only complaint is the hood when rolled up is quite bulky and annoying but other than that very happy with it. I use it to ride in the rain on my boat and jet ski and it’s the best jacket I’ve had!
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"El precio en oferta es lobque más me ha gustado, en su precio normal no vale hay marcas mejores técnicamente a igualdad de precio. La XL da talla para poder llevar debajo camiseta y jersey"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Buena calidad, por narices lo ha de ser, aunque no es para navegar con frío, ni es tan cortavientos. Vivo en una zona que en invierno, como mucho bajamos a 10º / 11º, pues en moto no puedes ir sólo con ella de abrigo porque te enfrías, imagínate navegando. Me esperaba más por ese precio."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"I bought this on a warehouse deal so got great value. Jacket size is comparable to other makes, but is shorter than most. Not good for Canadian winters but is fine for spring & early fall"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,prodotto di elevata qualità e vestibiltità...si consiglia una taglia inferiore rispetto a quella usuale. ad esempio io indosso giacche di taglia 52 ed ho ordinato una L che veste a pennello.
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Monaco di Baviera, Dicembre, 3°C. Sotto indossavo una felpa e stavo benissimo! I materiali sono ottimi. D'altronde Helly Hansen è sempre una garanzia! Attenzione solo alla taglie che sono quelle americane, quindi va preso di una misura inferiore del solito."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Passform und Tragekomfort sind nicht HH like wie ich es aus der Vergangenheit kenne. Ebenfalls vermitteln die Bilder eine kompaktere Jacke. Ging zurück
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Giubbino ottimo per climi miti, sicuramente non per stagioni fredde. Interno in pile. Dotato di un cappuccio di fortuna che si avvolge nel colletto. Gli oggetti nelle tasche restano asciutti anche  se si viene baghamti dalle onde."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Creo un de las compras mejores que he hecho . Chaqueta preciosa de gran calidad , creo llama la atención por lo bonita , tiene tres bolsillos exteriores y otro más interior con cremallera , es caliente , pero no demasiado , por lo que sirve para cualquier tiempo, según lo que te pongas debajo , la talla perfecta ."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"me gusto mucho,era para un regalo ,fue una lastima que no fuera la talla acertada, pero la devolucion y el reembolso fue tambien inmejorable. sin duda volvere a comprar otra igual .gracias"
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,"Era para un regalo y la persona que lo ha recibido ha quedado totalmente satisfecha. Calidad Helly Hansen en una chamarra creada para combatir la lluvia, cumple con creces su objetivo, posee gran impermeabilidad y el tejido interior es cálido y agradable."
Helly-Hansen 33874 Men's Crew Hooded Midlayer Jacket,,0,Te la venden como si fuera una armadura contra la intemperie...nada mas lejos de la realidad. A la que hace un poco de frio tienes que ponerte mas capas debajo. Es un timo de chaqueta. La chaqueta es finísima y no ofrece la protección que anuncian en su web. Por el mismo precio en el Decathlon tienes chaquetas que le dan mil patadas.

adidas Men's Soccer Condivo 18 Stadium Parka Jacket,Great jacket for outdoor sports/activities! Good quality and look too.,5,"I’m a female and use this jacket/parka for work when I’m providing medical coverage for outdoor games and practices (mainly for soccer and baseball). I’m usually outside anywhere from 5-12 hours/day.For sizing, I snagged a medium so there could be room for layering. As they advertised, the jacket does have drop down shoulders, so it makes it seem much bigger in that area; however, being someone who has broad shoulders, it keeps me comfortable and able to move freely to do any medical tasks as needed. Also, for you shorter folks, remember, it’s a parka, so it will tend to go closer to the knees than the 5’7”+ population.This thing keeps me pretty warm even when I’m only wearing one thin base layer underneath during 30-40 degree weather. Being able to tuck in the hood when unwanted is a big plus—when it’s tucked it serves as a pretty decent windshield for the back of my neck.I haven’t tested it under rainy weather conditions but it’s held up to the cold/heavy fog/freezing humidity.I wish there were more pockets than the two on the side so I can store a couple easy to reach items, but I don’t find that to be a big deal. This jacket’s intent is for soccer use while on the sideline, so I believe it’s serving it’s purpose. A big plus is that the adidas logo only shows in the front. The all black three stripes on the side make the jacket look even more classy/formal—I’m a fan."
adidas Men's Soccer Condivo 18 Stadium Parka Jacket,Awesome coat!,5,"Finally a warm outdoor coat that I can wear to my son's soccer games.  Fit is smaller than expected.  I am 5'11"" and 178 pounds.  Chart says Medium.  I ordered the medium and it was VERY snug when zippered.  Returned it and got the large. Size is just right now.  Sleeve length was just a tad longer than the medium, but not swimming in it. Maybe a 1/2 inch longer.  If you are border line between two sizes, go with the larger one! Coat is well made and I love the ""ghost"" Adidas black stripes from shoulder to cuff.  Extra parka length on the bottom is awesome as well.  Looking forward to many warmer soccer games!"
adidas Men's Soccer Condivo 18 Stadium Parka Jacket,Great Coat!,5,I’m 5’9” and 195 (pure muscle) and ordered a large. It fit really well and is extremely warm. I was very impressed. I wore a sweatshirt underneath on a 25 degree day with strong winds and I was sweating throughout the practice. I was moving but not running. The next day was 30 degrees and I wore a long sleeved t-shirt. Still too warm. That is remarkable because I am always cold. Great coat!
adidas Men's Soccer Condivo 18 Stadium Parka Jacket,Nice jacket.,4,An inside pocket would’ve given this jacket 5/5 stars.  Their tall skinny models don’t help with sizing. I took a gamble on a large and I’m glad I did. Fits perfect. A medium would’ve been too tight across my arms and chest. I’m 5’7” 180lbs with a muscular build.

adidas Men's Soccer Condivo 18 Stadium Parka Jacket,,0,Quite warm but the fit gets a bit tight when layered . However once u put on this jacket you wont need layering even in temperatures like -19°C . The look is great especially the zero rounding on the shoulders. Works well as a winter jacket !
